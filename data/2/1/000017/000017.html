N.
    Katherine Hayles, long-time advocate and interpreter of elit, mentions her colleagues’ frequent
    requests for recommendations for "the good stuff". The <cite class="title italic">Electronic Literature Collection Volume 1</cite> (<cite class="title italic">ELC</cite>) that she
    co-edited with Nick Montfort, Scott Rettberg, and Stephanie Strickland presents a partial answer
    to that request, though the project was already underway when she joined the team. Rettberg,
    co-founder of the Electronic Literature Organization (ELO), was already developing the <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite> with fellow ELO board members Montfort and Strickland. In addition to
    its release through the ELO website (<a class="ref" href="http://www.eliterature.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.eliterature.org/'); return false">http://www.eliterature.org/</a>) and ELO-sponsored events, the <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite> is also bundled with Hayles’ new book <cite class="title italic">Electronic Literature:
     New Horizons for the Literary</cite><span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hayles2008">#hayles2008</a></span>. Certainly her exegeses of the collection, presented in her texts
    and talks, will serve to raise the profile of this digital anthology. As in any artistic field,
    critical attention is the key to the long term circulation of these works in that winding path
    from journal article to syllabus and back. The collection thus begins its life with an
    influential retinue, as Hayles and ELO critics work in tandem with the work to promote an
    understanding of the forms of electronic literature as it has redefined itself since the days of
    literary hypertext in the late 1980s.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">So, what is the "good stuff" of electronic literature? Given the variety of
    pieces assembled here, there is no simple description.</div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Keyword: Variety</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">When the ELO decided to put the collection together, their organizing keyword was
     "variety". To interact with the sixty pieces is to experience their success in
    developing an enticing anthology particularly for course syllabi in electronic literature. The
    collection includes poetry, drama, and fiction rendered with sound, animation, and of course,
    that golden trait, "interactivity". The pieces use Shockwave, Flash, JavaScript,
    interactive programming languages (TADS and Inform) and HTML. The works are hyperlinked texts,
    animated poems, games, films, and new genres that have yet to be contained in any tidy taxonomy.
    The question "What is electronic literature?" quickly gives way to
     "What isn’t?" as these editors produce not so much a genre as a
    network of pieces whose greatest common factor is their delivery media, the CD-ROM or the
    Internet. However, while the collection includes a powerful cadre of those multi-talented
    dilettante artist-programmer-coders working alone or in collaboration, the variety of the works
    does not derive from a variety of producers, especially with respect to social economic status
    and racial characteristics. Perhaps the ELO’s efforts to freely disseminate the collection will
    provide a means of inspiring a wider variety of potential artists for the next volume. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Available on both CD-ROM and online, the collection also offers multiple organizational
    structures for exploring the contents. The user can pursue the front-page, a matrix of
    thumbnails for each piece, which again highlights the heterogeneity of the pieces themselves.
    Alternately, the reader can examine the works by keywords, authors, or titles.
    "Keywords" offers a breakdown of the different forms, according to the genre of
    the work ("codework" or "wordtoy"), the medium or programming
    language ("Flash", "VRML"), the author ("women
    authors", or "collaborative"), or the tone of the work
     ("parody/satire"). Some of the keyword seem to strain to describe their
    collection. "Network Forms", for example, is rather loosely defined as works that
     "are structured" or "make use of the styles of
     network forms such as the personal home page, the FAQ…, the blog, the listserv,…or
    email". Clearly this categorization seems more folksonomic than taxonomic, describing
    based on a set of related features rather than formal requirements. Again, this less rigorous
    naming protocol reflects a much more inclusive attitude than one might find in an anthology of
    poetic forms, for example.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Amidst the collection, there are some works that transcend the collection itself and stand out
    as pillars of electronic writing. Such pieces have already garnered much critical attention.
    Most notable among these would be Judd Morrissey’s <cite class="title italic">The Jew’s
    Daughter</cite>, Michael Joyce’s <cite class="title italic">Twelve Blue</cite>, Stuart Moulthrop’s
     <cite class="title italic">Reagan Library</cite>, Talan Memmott’s <cite class="title italic">Lexia to
     Perplexia</cite>, and Kate Pulinger’s <cite class="title italic">Inanimate Alice</cite>. When it
    does not include the "hits" of other megastars in new media, it often includes
    the visionaries with lesser-known works. Such pioneering artists include Shelley Jackson, author
    of the much critiqued <cite class="title italic">Patchwork Girl</cite>, who has since largely moved
    on to print, codework artist John Cayley, and MD Coverly, author of <cite class="title italic">Califia</cite>. Though syllabi have already enshrined these artists and their works as
     "electronic literature", the range of their forms, styles, and content perplex
    attempts to easily categorize these lexia, which is perhaps the central message of the <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite>.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Varieties of Forms</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Eliterati seem to cannibalize any electronic delivery venue they encounter. Perhaps the most
    obvious variety in the collection is menagerie of forms. Whether using natural language or
    computer languages, animation or games, the works offer a sense of the perpetual metamorphosis
    of electronic literature. Nonetheless, Flash and its precursor Shockwave are certainly dominant
    multimedia delivery systems. Descending from FutureWave Software’s SmartSketch of the early
    1990s, now produced and distributed by Adobe, this software that has been so dominant with
    online marketers and web designers has proven just as useful and contagious to eliterature.
    Whether allowing users to carve their own version of Michelangelo’s David in Deena Larson’s work
    or offering music, images, and voices in Ingrid Ankerson and Megan Sapnar’s <cite class="title italic">Cruising</cite>, Flash proves itself a malleable publication venue with seemingly endless
    possibilities to the elit artist. However, at the recent ELO/MITH the Future of Electronic
    Literature symposium, elit poet and tale-spinner Robert Kendall discussed his frustration with
    such a closed system in the open-source era. The strict seals on Flash’s SWF files have sent
    many authors to more "open" forms. Jason Nelson makes his Flash files freely
    available for remixing. The desire to share and open these art forms reveals another common goal
    among these artists, the promotion of the field itself through the development and circulation
    of works that can be reworked.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Programming languages offer these artists a major alternative to proprietary production
    systems, such as Flash. Not surprisingly, hypertext, including HTML/DHTML serves as the lingua
    franca of many of the other works, but it is not alone in programming languages. Perhaps due to
    editor Nick Montfort’s interests, interactive fiction, written in TADS and Inform, have a
    healthy representation, making up five of the sixty works, as opposed to say conversational
    agents, whose lone representative is actually also a work of interactive fiction, "Galatea" by Emily Short. This award-winning selection of interactive
    fiction demonstrates the ways in which these works refuse easy categorization even in the
    quite-recent genres they exemplify.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Written in 2000, using Inform, <cite class="title italic">Galatea</cite> opens by leading the
    interactor into a room in which stands the figure of Galatea, who balls her hand in a fist and
    says, "They told me you were coming." Very quickly, the interactor
    will discover that he or she can speak back. Here, then, is a chatbot, a conversational agent,
    in the middle of an interactive fiction (IF). Of course, from Floyd the robot in Steve
    Meretzky’s Infocom game <cite class="title italic">Planet Fall</cite> (1983), there have been
    non-player characters with whom to interact. However, <cite class="title italic">Galatea</cite> is
    neither a "traditional IF" nor a "traditional chatbot". If
    spelunking through <cite class="title italic">Adventure</cite> (or <cite class="title italic">Colossal Cave
     Adventure</cite>, 1976) launched the genre of IF, interrogating Galatea in a single room will
    seem markedly confined. If typing natural language input is the hallmark of conversational
    agents, chatters will feel a bit constrained by being forced to type "tell
     about" a subject or "ask about" a subject as the primary
    means of textual interaction. <cite class="title italic">Galatea</cite> combines the genres but
    defies and re-imagines the conventions of both. By the same token, the works in this collection
    refuse to meet generic expectations and perhaps even refuse to be categorized in the first
    place, hence the organization of the works not by a top-down table of contents but by
    non-exclusive keywords. Readers can choose their emphasis through the keywords, examining works
    by programming language, genre, or even gender of the authors, among other categories. Thus,
    readers interested in literary styles can find one set of categories, while programmers can
    pursue another. Of course, these last two emphases, the literary and the technological, prove to
    be competing poles in the collection and the electronic literature world at large.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Technique vs. Techne</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">One of the major questions facing electronic literature is what will be prioritized, the
    literary quality, which we might shorthand as the (post)humanistic resonances of a work of art,
    or the technical quality. Nowhere is that tension clearer than in the <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite>’s capsule intros of the works themselves. In the description for "Twelve Blue", written by Michael Joyce, author of the first hypertext
    narrative, <cite class="title italic">Afternoon, a story</cite> (1987), the editors write almost
    apologetically, "Although simple from a technical standpoint, the work tells
     a complex and enigmatic story of memory, desire, lust, truth, and consequences."
    Similarly, in the introduction to Alan Sondheim’s <cite class="title italic">Internet Text</cite>,
    the editors add, "These texts…are not multimedia productions or cybertext
     machines….Instead they document a long-standing online performance." Behind these
    justifications and apologia is a sense of obligation to serve up a collection of gizmos or, to
    borrow Shelley Jackson’s word, "Wunderkammer", or cabinet of
    curiosities. In the introduction to Rob Wittig’s <cite class="title italic">The Fall of the Site of
     Marsha</cite>, "a comic romp that uses the form of the common early-web
      'home page'," the editors note that Wittig's work "reflects less interest in using bleeding edge technology than in adapting
     literary forms to the vernacular styles of new media". Meanwhile, other pieces
    foreground the interface or the underlying processes. Of Dan Waber and Jason Pimble’s "I, You, We", the editors call the piece "visually
     pleasing and quite readable". Few literary collections offer assurances of the "readability" of their texts. To interactors who have little expectation of
    what is Electronic literature, such "excuses" may not be necessary at all.
    Nonetheless, in the editorial rooms of electronic literature echoes the constant call for the
    readable through interfaces that are novel and, more critically, technologically rich.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">To identify this tension is not to say that artists must choose between them or that works
    cannot have both technological innovation and literary, or specifically textual, virtuosity.
    However, let us consider Michael Joyce’s <cite class="title italic">Twelve Blue</cite>. In this
    technologically-limited work, Joyce composes lines that net us: "He pulled
     the water over him like a blanket and slept, anchored in the gaze of an unknown woman and the
     girl who loved him." There are no Microsoft Certifications or technical requirements for
    implementing and appreciating the beauty of Joyce’s prose with a style powerful enough to send
    less adept artists deeper into code and contraptions. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The dual emphases of technology and the literary play out across the content of the collection
    as well. Technology is frequently a central theme and at least a minor trope in these works.
    Some emphasize technological history, as artists become archaeologists of media forms. Take
    William Poindstone’s <cite class="title italic">Project for Tachistoscope</cite>, a work whose title
    puns on the timed projection device whose flashing images it remediates, or recreates through
    another medium, in a Flash. Other works more prominently display their literary history. "Oulipoems" by Millie Niss and Martha Deed provide text-machines inspired
    by the French literary movement the Ouvroir de littérature potentielle. Emily Short’s "Galatea" readapts the Pygmalion myth. Also, Tim Guthrie adapts Lance
    Olsen’s novel <cite class="title italic">10:01 </cite>to a browseable and enthralling format.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">By the time a reader encounters Jason Nelson’s <cite class="title italic">Dreamaphage</cite> or
    Maria Mencia’s <cite class="title italic">Birds Singing Other Birds’ Songs</cite>, readers may begin
    to wonder where the text has gone all together. Hayles has recently written and spoke about the
    inclusion of such texts, redefining electronic literature as that which redefines or makes us
    reconsider our relationship to language. Such works, she argues, require neither "natural language" nor text but a use of signs that helps us reimagine or
    reconfigure our relationship to sign systems of which our spoken language is only one. Such a
    move allows scholars of electronic literature to be broad in their scope while still maintaining
    a thread of continuity of purpose. Nelson himself has spoken about his own efforts as
    experiments in interface design <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#nelson2005">#nelson2005</a></span>. Perhaps the <cite class="title italic">Electronic Literature Collection Volume 1</cite> can be seen as a literature of the
    interface. These poets are innovators of form; they are constantly in dialogue with their media. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Despite this technological focus, the works manage to engage in a variety of political
    projects as well. Geniwate’s generative poetry <cite class="title italic">Concatenation</cite> calls
    up images of Middle Eastern conflict with <cite class="title italic">On the West Bank</cite>, where
     "soldiers teach the grammar of war". Stuart Moulthrop’s
    provocatively titled <cite class="title italic">Reagan Library</cite> explores memory loss in
    evocation of its Presidential namesake, though its text offers a less-directly political game
    space. Nonetheless, in the model of the avant-garde, these pieces become political more through
    the <span class="foreign i">Verfremsdungseffekt</span>, when they break the spell of the seamless
    interfaces, when they reveal the ways in which our interfaces hail us. If the rest of the world
    is using Flash to create sleek gosh-wow splash pages, creating illusions of so-called
     "transparent" interfaces, this group of artists is trying to dislodge the
    interactor from such a comfortable position. As a trace of this subversive movement, one of the
     <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite> keywords, Hacktavist, which combines hacking with activism,
    has no works associated with it.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Sharing the Wealth</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">The ELO collection promotes the sharing of this electronic literature among artists,
    educators, and audiences. While the production of the CD-ROM seems to be a gesture toward the
    world of books and discrete objects that can be placed in libraries and on shelves, Creative
    Commons licensing (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.5) puts the collection and copyright in
    the hands of the "wreaders" (writer readers) as Jim Andrews calls
    them in his "author’s description" of "Nio". The
    No-Derivative Works restriction prevents corporations from taking this content and developing a
    viral marketing version of, say, <cite class="title italic">Lexia to Perplexia</cite>. However, the
    restriction also prohibits a new net artist from transferring their own deck of words into, for
    example, <cite class="title italic">Stud Poetry</cite>, a piece which rewires a poker game to
    generate poetry. Nonetheless, a user could request permission for derivative works, which is
    just the kind of community-building the Electronic Literature Organization tries to foster.
    These works are meant to spread as seeds for future projects from whatever audience it can
    reach.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">Hardly an all-ages anthology, though, the <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite> is not appropriate
    for all audiences. Much electronic literature follows the model of experimental writing of the
    New Novel and beyond with a no-holds-barred approach to content. Content is often sexually
    explicit, emblematized by such work as Alan Sondheim’s <cite class="title italic">Internet
    Text</cite>, with text files documenting explicit sex acts. Surprisingly, the collection
    includes a "Children’s literature" keyword, denoting "a work directed to an audience of children". However, <cite class="title italic">Inanimate Alice</cite> is the only example. On the other hand, many works play with images of
    childhood for the reflection of adults, for example Donna Leishman’s animated "RedRidinghood", a revision of the children’s tale with a look into the
    troubled interior of its characters. Shelley Jackson’s <cite class="title italic">My Body a
     Wunderkammer</cite> offers reflections on the character’s breasts and penis. Net nannies and
    educators of younger students (K-8) will no doubt need to hold the keys for these wondrous
    rooms.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">What’s Not in the Collection?</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">While the collection is diverse in its objects and includes a menagerie of interfaces and
    kinds of semiotic communications, the roll call of authors maintains a certain demographic
    homogeneity. These works, developed in a literary environment after the advances of pluralistic
    and inclusive curricula, offer little in the way of cultural diversity. Perhaps as a symptom,
    racial representations tend to be white. Questions of race become blurred in questions of
    post-human races. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">At this point in the argument, the burden of proof typically falls on the critic to
    demonstrate the lack of diversity. I do not have access to the family trees of all of the
    contributors, but having met or encountered most of the authors at conferences, I can at least
    attest to a lack of phenotypical diversity. Perhaps an easier place to look is in the texts
    themselves, specifically at the characters represented, visually or otherwise. With respect to
    the visual representations, white-hued characters abound, as in Marsha of Rob Wittig’s piece or
    Dona Leishman’s Deviant and <cite class="title italic">Little Red Riding Hood</cite>. Those who study
    traditional print literature have long-since theorized the effects of literary collections that
    seem to exclude various audiences. Surely, the ELO can only choose works from those who submit.
    However, the lack of diversity in the authors reflects the digital divide between these groups
    and historically (and apparently still) underrepresented groups, such as African Americans. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">The collection itself may serve to remedy part of this problem, for despite the reported
     "global" reach of the World Wide Web, literacy in electronic literature
    typically requires a one-to-one communication between artist-critic and audience. Again without
    tracing out the Facebook networks, I should note that there are typically fewer than six-degrees
    of separation between the various elit artists, since many create elit in the context of
    electronic literature courses and many of the artists included have been involved with ELO. The
    number of people with the time, training, and access to create these artistic works is quite
    small and were introduced to the form by another person, rather than a random web search. To an
    extent, electronic literature is a guild-based art form, one that requires mentoring just as it
    requires evangelists. The <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite> may serve as a useful self-starter
    kit for those who do not have direct access to one of the initiated, especially since the
    collection is available free online.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">Also lacking were sufficient examples of elit beyond Europe and the United States. Another
    topic at the ELO symposium was how to foster more relations with artists outside the
    English-speaking word and in other parts of the globe. Artists such as Colombia’s Jaime
    Alejandro Rodriguez Ruiz, whose narrative work <cite class="title italic">Golpe de Gracia</cite>
    warrants a place in a truly representative anthology. Montfort mentioned his own regrets about
    the absence of works from other languages but explained that the editors agreed they could not
    authoritatively evaluate non-English works without having an editor with mastery of that
    language. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Like many of the works it has collected, the <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite> evolved from
    constraints. The more general constraint, according to Montfort, was to publish only works that
    could be run from a CD and did not require either outside servers or material instantiation,
    such as those needed for installations and performance pieces. For consistency, the editors
    decided not to include any pieces that merely documented a performance or work as opposed to
    presenting the work itself. According to Montfort, questions subsequently arose about the need
    or relevance of physical copies of the <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite> when even CD-ROMs are
    becoming cultural artifacts. Why put a collection on a CD when it is available on the web?
    Still, if they had planned to distribute online as well, why set the seemingly antithetical
    boundary of the CD-ROM?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">The answer is preservation. In an age where web pages disappear faster than yesterday’s
    Firefox plugins, it is increasingly important to preserve at least some of these works off the
    web. This archival work has been another major project of the Electronic Literature
    Organization, the Preservation, Archiving, and Dissemination (PAD) project. The <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite> will no doubt serve all of those aims, especially as future volumes
    follow. Hayles reports that she expects future <cite class="title italic">ELC</cite>’s to appear on a
    biennial basis. With this work, the<cite class="title italic"> ELC</cite> editors reveal themselves
    to be part of a much more established tradition of literary communities by celebrating,
    preserving, and advocating forms that will challenge, inspire, and, for the time being, compile.
