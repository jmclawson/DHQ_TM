                    Comics, comic books, and graphic novels are increasingly the target of seriously scholarly attention in the humanities. Moreover, comic books are exceptionally complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication. The complexity of these documents, their combination of textual and pictorial elements, and the collaborative nature of their production shares much in common with other complex documents studied by humanists—illuminated manuscripts, artists’ books, illustrated poems like those of William Blake, letterpress productions like those of the Kelmscott Press, illustrated children’s books, and even Web pages and other born-digital media. Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, is a TEI-based XML vocabulary for encoding and analyzing comic books, comics, graphic novels, and related documents. This article discusses the goals and motivations for developing CBML, reviews the various content types found in comic book publications, provides an overview and examples of the key features of the CBML XML vocabulary, explores some of the problems and challenges in the encoding and digital representation of comic books, and outlines plans for future work. The structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject for the general study of complex documents, especially documents combining pictorial and textual elements.</p></div><div class="div div0"><div class="epigraph center"><blockquote><p class="ptext"><span class="hi bold">Science Exhibit</span></p><p class="ptext"><span class="hi italic">Experiments<br/>

                    Book Markup Language, or CBML, an XML<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e111">[1]</a>
                    vocabulary for encoding multiform documents that are variously called comics, comic books,
                    and "graphic novels"<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e118">[2]</a> as well as other documents that integrate comics content<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e127">[3]</a> or that share formal features with comics content. A markup language is a set of machine-readable textual
                    codes, or "tags," that are used to identify structure,
                    semantics, and other features of documents and data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e141">[4]</a> The application of these
                    codes to a document is typically a necessary
                    stage, often the most crucial and informative stage, of editing, analyzing, indexing
                    publishing, visualizing, and otherwise studying or manipulating texts in digital
                    environments. The act of encoding a document is a form of discovery, or prospecting, in which the encoder maps a document's structure, identifies semantic elements of interest, and documents relationships internal and external to the document. Scholarly encoding is a form of both reading and writing. The reading, shaped by the constraints of a markup language, is inscribed upon and embedded within the digital text. As literary scholar and digital humanist Jerome McGann has noted, "When you mark up a text you are ipso facto reading and interpreting it. A … text marked up in TEI [a scholarly encoding language] has been subjected to a certain kind of interpretation"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2001">#mcgann2001</a></span>.
                    Sperberg-McQueen, Huitfeldt, and Renear assert that markup is constitutive of meaning, markup is interpretive, markup is performative, markup acknowledges or licenses inferences about the text:
                    
                    <blockquote><p class="ptext">Markup is inserted into textual material not at random, but to convey some meaning.</p><p class="ptext">        
                    An author may supply markup as part of the act of composing a text; in this case the markup expresses the author’s intentions, e.g. as to the structure or appearance of the text. The author creates a section heading, for example, by creating an appropriate element in the document; the content of that element is a section heading because the author says so, and the markup is simply the method by which the author says so. The markup, that is, has <span class="hi italic">performative</span> significance.
               </p><p class="ptext">     
                   In other cases, markup is supplied as part of the transcription in electronic form of pre-existing material. In such cases, markup reflects the understanding of the text held by the transcriber; we say that the markup <span class="hi italic">expresses a claim</span> about the text. The transcriber identifies a section heading in the pre-existing text by transcribing it and tagging it as a section heading; the content of that element is a section heading if the transcriber’s interpretation is correct, but other interpreters might disagree; it is plausible to imagine discussions over whether a given way of marking up a text is correct or incorrect.<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e163">[5]</a></p><p class="quote">
                                In the one case, markup is constitutive of the meaning; in the other, it is interpretive. In each case, the reader may legitimately use the markup to make inferences about the structure and properties of the text. For this reason, we say that markup <span class="hi italic">licenses certain inferences</span> about the text.

                        <blockquote><p class="ptext">Perhaps we need to look to the pleasure of mutability. To recuperate XML, politically and aesthetically, we should be looking not to the paradigms of XML usage that arise from librarianship and from industry-level ideas of the separability of form and content, but rather to paradigms of performance of a different kind. By shifting our view we can understand XML as a way of expressing perspectival understandings of the text: not as a way of capturing what is timeless and essential, but as a way of inscribing our own changeable will on the text—in other words, as a form of reading. Seen this way, XML's presentational flexibility derives not from a separation of presentation and content, but rather from the shifting vantage points from which the text appears to us, the shifting relationships that constrain our understanding of it, the adaptability and strategic positioning of our own readerly motivations.</p><p class="quote">
                                    Ironically, this is a view which emerges most clearly at the margins of current digital text practice. It is not visible in the large digital library projects, whose workflow has come to resemble an industrial operation complete with offshore outsourcing, detailed division of labor, reliance on automation and robotics, and an emphasis, in the output, on uniformity and quantity (thankfully planned obsolescence has not yet become part of the strategy). But we can find it in the small projects designed by individual faculty, typically in conjunction with their teaching, to create digital versions of individual texts which serve as readings: often idiosyncratic, unscalable, representing private insight. They function more like an article than an archive, as a local, contingent expression of insight. [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2005">Flanders 2005</a>, 60-61]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">
                    The development of a markup language that can support such scholarly reading and interpretation necessitates a careful study and analysis of the content, structure, and semantics of the class or classes of documents for which the language is designed—in this case, the comic book.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">CBML is based on the <cite class="title"><a class="ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/" onclick="window.open('http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/'); return false">Text

Graphic narratives typically manifest as "books," stapled or otherwise bound leaves, perhaps thirty-six pages, with an interesting and complex structure, incorporating the graphic narrative—the sequential art and text or "comics" content—alongside a rich assortment of paratexts: advertisements, fan mail, and so on. The emphasis on both "comics" and "books" in the title of the language signals an awareness of the full range of content in the material artifact and the integration of comics content with related paratextual content. The material properties of the book—the codex form, the leaves and pages, the physical properties of the paper—are inseparable from the structure, pacing, and design of the narrative. Certainly less page-bound organizational and compositional frameworks are possible, such as the newspaper strips with long-running narrative arcs, in which the daily "strip" of three or four panels is the basic structural unit.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">
                    The traditional grouping of panels into deliberately composed groups (often corresponding to the physical page or the "strip" of a newspaper daily) is being challenged by changing publishing and reading technologies. iPhones and other smartphones have become popular devices for reading newly published comics as well as "reprints" of older comics. However, a full-page grid of panels is not easily readable on the smaller screen of the typical smartphone, so the software interfaces on such devices focus on a single panel at a time. The deliberate juxtaposition of graphic and textual elements in the original composition is shattered by the interface requirements and limitations of the reading device. As new comics work is increasingly targeted at such digital platforms, the traditional grouping of panels into compositional units resembling pages may be abandoned for new compositional strategies. Larger format devices like the iPad and other tablets are better able to represent full-page compositions of panels while also allowing zooming in to focus on individual panels. The isolation of a panel from its surrounding context is not easily achieved in print media. While the reader's eyes and attention may focus on a single panel at a time, other panels on the page remain in the reader's field of vision. The migration of comics content to digital reading devices, and the structural and aesthetic implications of that migration, call attention to the impact of the material characteristics of the comic book document.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Comic books are often very formally self-conscious documents and express a fascination with their own bibliographic identities—creators (comic book writers and artists) become characters in the narrative, editorial notes refer to episodes from prior issues, comic books and paratextual elements, such as advertisements, are parodied within the comic book narrative, publication milestones (such as the first, fiftieth, or one hundredth issue are highlighted and celebrated. These literary, rhetorical, and commercial moves point to a self-awareness of the comic book as document and bibliographic object.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">CBML is intended primarily for representing, modeling, and analyzing twentieth- and twenty-first-century comic books, daily comic strips, longer narratives or "graphic novels," and Web comics and other comics content published on digital platforms, such as smartphones and tablets.

Since the more recent financial and critical success of Marvel’s X-Men and Spider-Man film franchises, the film industry has been flooded with films based on comic books, many based on mainstream super hero comics, others adapted from realistic, personal, and autobiographical graphic narratives, often published by smaller publishers.

                    digital collections of, for instance, English poetry or American fiction support
                    the study and analysis of more traditional literary forms. A large corpus of digitized comic books, along
                    with encoded transcriptions and descriptive metadata, would allow scholars to
                    search the text of comic books, search for keywords related to topics of interest,
                    search for the appearance of particular characters, or search for works by
                    particular writers and artists. Additionally, when exploited to its full
                    potential, a large CBML collection would allow searching—and other forms of
                    computer processing and computational analysis—based on structural, aesthetic, and
                    informational and documentary features peculiar to the genre of comic books.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Large digital collections of comic books would support the types of searching that is now taken for granted in large digital collections of literary and other texts. This sort of functionality has proven incredibly useful and has transformed the ways in which scholars and students conduct research and "read." This now commonplace functionality though can be particularly significant for the study of comics, given the complexity of the fictional universes that have developed in the works of many comics publishers. For instance, major characters like Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and Wolverine appear
                    regularly in multiple titles. DC Comics' Batman is the featured
                    character in <cite class="title">Batman</cite>, <cite class="title">Detective Comics</cite>, and other
                    titles; he is a prominent member of the Justice League superhero teams featured in a number of different titles; and he shares adventures with other heroes in titles such as <cite class="title">The Brave
                        and the Bold</cite> and <cite class="title">World’s Finest</cite>. Since Batman
                    shares the same fictional universe with most of DC’s other characters, he will
                    make frequent "guest appearances" across their entire line of publications. One will even find publishers occasionally
 cooperating to merge their fictional universes and publish works that
 feature, for instance, Superman from DC and Spider-Man from Marvel. Therefore, a scholar researching the development and representation of a particular character
 cannot confine herself to a small number of publications, but must consider
 almost the full output of a publisher or even multiple publishers.</div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure01.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>From 1976, <cite class="title">Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man</cite>, the first cross-over comic book featuring characters from comic book publishing giants DC (Superman) and Marvel (Spider-Man).

Another motivation behind the development of CBML is the desire to explore more generally the modeling and representation of
                    the broader class of documents that tightly integrate pictorial images and text.
                    Comic books are just one such type of complex graphic document; other examples include illuminated
                    manuscripts; seventeenth-century alchemical manuscripts, with hand-drawn figures
                    and graphic symbols; artists’ books; artists’ sketchbooks; illustrated poems like those of William Blake; letterpress productions like those of the Kelmscott Press; illustrated children’s
                    books; newspaper and magazine advertisements; and even Web pages and other
                    born-digital media. Comic books provide some of the more obvious examples of this
                    integration and co-dependence of image and text, but lessons learned in the modeling of comic books may be applied to other forms.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Martha Rust, in her essay "'It's a Magical World': The Page in Comics and Medieval Manuscripts," writes:
                    <blockquote><p>Both medieval book artists and contemporary cartoonists make use of the page as a device for giving their readers access to a domain of representation that is beyond the regimes of either pictures or words—yet somehow in the shadow of both. [<a class="ref" href="#rust2008">Rust 2008</a>, 25]</p></blockquote>
                    The page is indeed one of the primary structural and compositional units of comics. In TEI the page is viewed as a "milestone," an empty marker within the flow of the text. In comics books (and similar documents), the page is not an arbitrary milestone, but a compositional feature—a composed container for "panels" and text.</div><div id="figure02" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure02.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure02.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>The third of twelve miniatures from the <cite class="title">Electorum parvum seu

In <a class="ref" href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>, below the "panels" we find explanatory text, similar to the narrative captions found in comic books. Such examples illustrate formal and structural features of comics shared by many other document types. The analytical and descriptive strategies of TEI and CBML may prove useful in studying not just modern comics but an even more historically and culturally diverse assortment of document types.
                </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Perhaps the most significant motivation behind the development of CBML is the wish to support for comic books and related documents the interpretive strategies and inscriptions of readings—discussed in the introduction above—that occur when a text is encoded. Unlike the traditional academic essay, in which a reading or analysis is sprinkled with relevant quotations from primary source materials, an encoded text may combine a digital representation of a full source text inscribed, in the form of markup, by a reading and performance of the text.  Like the image and text of a comic book, the source text and the scholar's reading and analysis are inextricably intermingled in the encoded document. Encoded documents are metadocuments "which describe and enhance information but also serve as performative instruments.… As texts that describe a language, naming and articulating its structures, forms, and functions they [metalanguages and metatexts] seem to trump languages that are used merely for composition or expression" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">#drucker2009</a></span>. CBML facilitates more transformative reading strategies that have developed in response to the increasing numbers of high-quality digital and digitized documents. Literary scholar Franco Moretti has popularized the term "distant reading" to describe strategies for analyzing massive numbers of literary and historical documents:
                        <blockquote><p>
                                [I]f you want to look beyond the canon … close reading will not do it. It’s not designed to do it, it’s designed to do the opposite. At bottom, it’s a theological exercise—very solemn treatment of very few texts taken very seriously—whereas what we really need is a little pact with the devil: we know how to read texts, now let’s learn how not to read them. Distant reading: where distance … <span class="hi italic">is a condition of knowledge</span>: it allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes—or genres and systems. And if, between the very small and the very large, the text itself disappears, well, it is one of those cases when one can justifiably say, Less is more. If we want to understand the system in its entirety, we must accept losing something. [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 57]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">
                        Digital technologies facilitate both close and distant reading strategies. Individual comic books and graphic narratives may be better understood through strategies of close reading, with careful attention paid to minute details of linguistic and visual language and document features, but comic books as a system and extended comic book narratives—which often unfold over decades in thousands or tens of thousands of individual documents by hundreds of creators (writers and artists)—benefit also from the distant reading (of text, image, and metadata) from comic book documents.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">
                    CBML aims to support such digitally-enabled and embedded performances and readings in comic books and across a range of graphics-intensive documents. This motivation is not unique to the study of comics or the development of CBML, but comic books and related documents do have particular, if not unique, features that must be supported in markup languages if we are to realize this goal.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Encoding the Comic Book</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">The following sections examine features and content of comic book documents and propose encoding strategies for representing, documenting, and analyzing those features and content types.

In fact, McCloud's definition makes no mention of text. Certainly one can find examples of comics without any words, but, as McCloud acknowledges, the vast majority of comics do in fact contain a great deal of text of different types. The intricate and complex interplay between text and image is one of the defining features of most comic books. While we typically say that we
                        <em class="emph">watch</em>, <em class="emph">view</em>, or <em class="emph">see</em> a film, we more often say that we
                        <em class="emph">read</em> a comic. Lawrence L. Abbott, Henry John Pratt and others
                        have emphasized the characterization of comics as a
                        "read" medium [<a class="ref" href="#abbott1986">Abbott 1986</a>][<a class="ref" href="#pratt2009">Pratt 2009</a>]. Abbott stresses this
                        characterization in part to bolster his argument for the preeminence of
                        text over image in comics: "The perceiver is, after all, termed a 'reader'—and the subordination of the pictorial to the literary in comic art is one of the subtlest realities of the medium" [<a class="ref" href="#abbott1986">Abbott 1986</a>, 156]. David Carrier places a similar emphasis, not just on text, but on the distinctive text—the speech balloon—of comics: "The speech balloon is a defining element of the comic because it establishes a word/image unity that distinguishes comics from pictures illustrating a text" [<a class="ref" href="#carrier2000">Carrier 2000</a>, 4]. The ability to identify and characterize textual components of comics art and to describe and analyze the interplay between text and image is one of the chief aims of CBML. TEI provides a host of options to support extensive analysis, textual criticism, and annotation. CBML suggests applications of existing TEI markup for encoding many of the distinctive features of comics and also provides a handful of additional elements for distinctive features that are not adequately handled by existing TEI markup.

The <span class="monospace">&lt;teiHeader&gt;</span> is a mandatory and potentially very large TEI element that prefaces the encoded transcription of the document. The <span class="monospace">&lt;teiHeader&gt;</span> provides a great deal of detailed descriptive information and other metadata about both the digital file and the source document.  And it may, for instance, provide detailed information about all the characters appearing within a given document. With a large collection of comic books encoded using these mechanisms from CBML and TEI, a search interface could provide users the ability to retrieve instantly, from thousands or tens of thousands of comics, all the panels containing a character of interest, regardless of whether or not the character's name appears in the original panel.

                            Panels, especially in print comic books, are not presented as a continuous, unbroken stream of narrative units, nor are they randomly laid out in sequence across a series of pages. The total collection of panels that make up a comics narrative are subdivided into panel groups. The sequence of panels that a reader has in her field of
                            vision is typically an intentionally composed
                            composite component of the larger work.  For instance, a panel depicting a moment of high suspense might occur as the last panel of a recto page, forcing a lingering suspenseful pause while the reader turns the page to reveal the resolution of the suspense in the first panel of the verso page. These carefully composed panel groups often correspond to a physical page, but a panel group may share a physical page with advertisements or other content or may correspond to two physical pages of a two-page spread, in which panels are read from left to right, top to bottom across two opposing verso and recto pages. To capture this level of composition,
                            CBML adopts the TEI <span class="monospace">&lt;div&gt;</span> element, which is meant to encode a subdivision of the text. The <span class="monospace">@type</span> attribute on <span class="monospace">&lt;div&gt;</span> is used to indicate the type of textual subdivision, e.g., chapter, act, scene, canto, etc. In this case we use the string "panelGrp" to indicate the division is a grouping of panels. Another attribute, <span class="monospace">@subtype</span>, is also available to distinguish further between different types of panel groups. Of course, the generic <span class="monospace">&lt;div&gt;</span> element may also be used in CBML to encode other subdivisions, such as chapters or "parts," which are commonly found in comics.</div><div id="eg_002" class="example"><blockquote class="eg"><pre><tt>&lt;div type="panelGrp" xml:id="eg_002"&gt;

                            panels. Textual content is found primarily in narrative captions and word
                            balloons. Abbott provides a brief
                            description of these elements: <blockquote><p>Narration is placed in squared-off areas [narrative captions], usually colored yellow
                                    in comic books. Dialogue is located in white “balloons” that include
                                    little pointed projections indicating the speaker. Unspoken thoughts
                                    follow a similar pattern except that the balloons are billowy, and a
                                    string of small white circles leads to the thinker. Both narration
                                    and dialogue are recognized as extra-visual phenomena that may share
                                    space in the panel plane with the drawing but are not part of the
                                    scene. The visual assumption is that narration and dialogue lie on
                                    the plane of the opening through which one views the scene,
                                    augmenting the pictorial element but not part of it. [<a class="ref" href="#abbott1986">Abbott 1986</a>, 156]</p></blockquote> Abbott’s description is accurate but incomplete. In addition to
                            speech and thought balloons, one may find other types of balloons in comic book content. For instance, since so many genres of comics concern supernatural, speculative, fantastic, and science fiction narratives, "telepathic" balloons are not uncommon and are visually distinct from standard speech or thought balloons.

                            One also finds a great
                            deal of graphic stylistic variation among speech balloons. For instance, a character
                            like the Vision, from Marvel Comics’ <cite class="title">The Avengers</cite> superhero
                            team, is usually depicted with stylized speech balloons that
                            highlight his android origins. Interestingly, when the Vision made his first
                            appearance in <cite class="title">The Avengers</cite> #57 in October 1968, his speech
                            balloons were not styled differently from other characters. Later, the
                            text inside the Vision’s speech balloons would be styled in a hand-written
                            italics. The rectangular balloons with rounded corners were introduced in
                            issue #91 in 1971. A yellowish tint was added to the balloons two months later in issue #93
                            and this convention has now persisted for over thirty-five years. This evolution of the graphic representation of the Vision's speech might be tied to an analysis of other aspects of the character's development.
                            <div id="figure10" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure10.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure10.jpg" alt=""/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 10. </div>The Vision’s speech balloon is styled to suggest his android

                            The Vision's speech balloon is, however, still a speech balloon, but it is styled differently than other conventional speech balloons.  TEI is equipped with a suite of elements and attributes (<span class="monospace">&lt;rendition&gt;</span>, <span class="monospace">@rendition</span>, and <span class="monospace">@rend</span>) to describe the styling, or "rendition" of various elements in source documents. In primarily textual documents, the <span class="monospace">&lt;rendition&gt;</span> element and related attributes might be used to describe details such as font family, font size, justification, and son on. The rendition features of TEI may be used in CBML contexts to describe graphical features, for instance to provide a detailed description of the distinctive styling of the android's speech balloon. 
                        </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">Another convention for presenting characters’ speech and thoughts in comics eliminates balloons entirely and instead uses captions that incorporate both narrative text and the dialogue/monologue text usually found in balloons. At the other extreme are comics that contain balloons but lack narrative captions. The presence or absence of captions and balloons are particularly interesting examples of meaningful structural variation found in comics. The basic structures of the graphic panels and pictorial elements may be similar, but the structures of the textual elements are completely different. For McCloud, who privileges the pictorial, the different textual structures may be of interest but do not affect the content’s status as comics. For other scholars who privilege the textual over the pictorial—Carrier, for instance—the lack of text balloons may mean that such documents are simply illustrated stories and not comics at all [<a class="ref" href="#carrier2000">Carrier 2000</a>, 4, 27-45]. Certainly, these structures have important generic implications. The use of separate narrative captions and balloons results in structures that closely resembles the textual structures found in drama and film, while the absence of balloons results in structures that more closely resemble prose fiction. A complete absence of narrative captions is a likely indicator of the absence of a narrator in the text, while comics with a high number of narrative captions might indicate a very strong narrative presence. An examination of the absence, presence, and frequency of narrative captions and balloons could be a useful strategy for analyzing the role of narration and the narrator in comics generally or in a particular title or author.

Diegetic documents appear in the comics art as part of the narrative’s fictional universe. Such documents can be seen and "read" by the narrative's characters. We find diegetic documents or text appearing as street signs, store front signage, billboards, newspaper headlines, or even full newspaper articles. Pratt discusses clearly diegetic text and the degrees to which other text (balloons, captions, sound effects) may also be diegetic:
                            <blockquote><p>The words within comics have an interesting relationship to the diegesis, the story world that is "real" to and hence can be experienced by the characters who populate it. When a street number or a postcard is depicted in a comic, it is diegetic. Not only the reader, but also the characters can see it. However, only the reader can see the other types of words that occur in comics. The characters cannot see word balloons, sound effects, or narration (leaving aside cases where, for example, comics artists playfully have their characters interact with word balloons: breaking them, using them to float, and so on). But these features are not exactly non-diegetic. Though characters cannot see speech balloons, they can hear the words in them, and presumably each character is aware of the contents of his or her own thought balloons. When there are sound effects, characters can hear them, though the sounds heard within the diegesis may not be exactly the same as the sounds depicted in words. "Kablammo!" may be onomatopoetic, but it cannot capture the exact sound of an explosion. And characters may even be aware of narration, as is the case where one of the characters is also the narrator, or in the unusual situation where a character reacts directly to an impersonal narrator. [<a class="ref" href="#pratt2009">Pratt 2009</a>, 108]</p></blockquote>
                            The term <span class="hi italic">diegetic</span> is frequently used in film studies to distinguish between the film score music that plays in the background but cannot be heard by the characters and the diegetic music that is part of the film's narrative sphere, for instance, when a character in the film plays the guitar or when music plays in a bar where characters meet. Famous examples from film include many of the scenes set in Rich Blaine's Café Américain in <cite class="title">Casablanca</cite> and the music played by the "Cantina Band" in the Mos Eisley Cantina scene in the original 1977 <cite class="title">Star Wars</cite> film.

Fan mail
                        highlights the social aspect of comic book creation and readership; the

                        are themselves extremely complex documents. One cannot study the history of television
                        in the twentieth century without careful attention to television
                        advertising. Similarly, one cannot study the comic
                        book without close consideration of the advertisements in document. In comic books from major publishers such as Marvel and DC, advertisements are, in terms of quantity, the dominant content type apart from the comics content.<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e1298">[15]</a> Of particular interest are the many advertisements that adopt conventions from comics. The intermingling of comics-based narrative with commercial advertisement
                        becomes a key element in the production of meaning in the text. In addition to advertisements for third-party products, comics are rife with advertisements and other promotional materials for the comic books and other products of the publisher. These promotional materials contribute to the transformation of the publisher from commercial entity to a club or cult<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e1304">[16]</a> and to the process by which a reader becomes a "fan." Unfortunately, this important content is usually omitted from both print and digital "reprints" from the comic book publishers.
                        </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Advertisements are interesting on many levels. For instance, a scholar
                        examining gender roles in comics may be interested to know that certain
                        advertisements are addressed directly to boys ("Look, Fellows!")
                        and that participation in certain activities promoted by the ads, such as selling <cite class="title">Grit</cite> newspaper in
                        one’s neighborhood, required one to answer in the affirmative the question,
                            "Are you a boy?" Later versions of the same ad would
                        replace "Look, Fellows!" with "Look, Friends!" and "Are You
                            a Boy?" with "Male or Female?"</div><div id="figure17" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure17.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure17.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 17. </div>An advertisement recruiting boys to sell <cite class="title">Grit</cite> newspaper

                        which they appropriate the characteristics of comics content, the dominant content type of the "host" document. One finds such
                        appropriations increasingly in video and film as elaborate advertisements
                        adopt the conventions of, for instance, music videos or short films. The
                        televised broadcast of the National Football League’s annual Super Bowl
                        championship has become a showcase for such advertisements. Further
                        intermingling of commerce and "art" is found in the
                        relatively recent trend of advertisements in the movie theater and product
                        placement within television and film. Comics anticipate such trends, on a
                        mass scale, decades before they became commonplace in other media.

Many comics publishers or individual publications would provide readers with an opportunity to formalize their status as fans by joining official fan clubs, such as Marvel’s Merry Marvel Marching Society and later F.O.O.M., or Friends of Ol’ Marvel. These fan clubs also have publications, the digital representation of which can benefit from CBML encoding. These fan publications are important historical documents and include interviews with comics creators, news items, comic book checklists, games and puzzles, photographs and illustrations, previews, advertisements, and comics content in the form of covers and sample pages and panels from upcoming issues, reprinted comics, and original comics content created for the fan magazines.</div></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">The existence and relevance of these many comics-related publications is an important reason behind the decision to base CBML on TEI. Comic book content does not exist in isolation from other document types but is often integrated into essays, news articles, reviews, scholarly criticism, and so on. TEI provides robust mechanisms for encoding these more familiar document types, while CBML supplements TEI with features necessary for encoding the integrated comic book content.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">One of the most noteworthy aspects of TEI is its many elements, attributes, and other structures for describing components of scholarly textual editions, including textual variants among multiple printings and editions, authorial manuscripts and typescripts, notes, annotations, and marginalia. Like many other modern documents, comic books can have complicated publication and production histories, with multiple editions and reprintings. Likewise, published comic books have their origins in authorial manuscripts and typescripts and original art with marginalia and notes of various types. See <a class="ref" href="#figure24">Figure 24</a> and <a class="ref" href="#figure25">Figure 25</a>.

Other important features are also captured, such as the structure of the comic book; the sequence of pages and panels; the grouping of panels into compositional units that may or may not correspond to a physical page; classification of panel transition types and analysis of individual transitions from panel to panel. However, the examples above do not attempt to describe the <em class="emph">pictures</em> one finds in the comic book, nor should they. Comic books are a visual, graphic art form combining text and image. CBML/TEI/XML is a text format. While one could certainly use CBML to describe details about any or all of the pictures in a comic book publication, such an effort would undermine the hybrid form of the comic book. The visual, pictorial, and graphic design elements of the comic book simply cannot be fully or adequately described or translated as text. While many design features common to textual documents, such as text size and font characteristics, may be reasonably and usefully described using common TEI techniques, it would be futile and impractical to attempt to describe every detail of every picture in a comic book document. The encoded  document, with markup containing and describing metadata, structure, transcription, and analysis, should co-exist with and be linked to digital facsimile page images of the comic book. Thankfully, in current digital environments and on the Web, such linking and display of text and image is relatively simple, if time-consuming, to accomplish.

                    On the other hand, depending on the goals of any particular project employing CBML, some scholars will wish to add to the encoded text some description and analysis of the pictorial aspect of the comic book. If one has such needs, CBML and TEI provide suitable mechanisms. Typed TEI <span class="monospace">&lt;note&gt;</span> elements may be used to provide detailed descriptions of the pictorial dimensions of the document.  For example, one might use <span class="monospace">&lt;note type="panelGrpDesc"&gt;</span> for a "panel group description" or <span class="monospace">&lt;note type="panelDesc"&gt;</span> for a "panel description."</div><div id="figure26" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure26.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure26.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 26. </div>Two panels from <cite class="title">The Incredible Hulk</cite> #114.

In particular, notice the distinctive font used for the dialog of Thor, the large figure in the center of the panel. This use of distinctive fonts for specific characters is also an indicator of changing modes of production for comics. Traditionally, comics were lettered by hand. It is now increasingly common, especially among the major comic book publishers, for the lettering to be done in desktop publishing and design software using digital fonts, many of which are designed to resemble traditional hand-drawn comic book lettering, providing a digital illusion of handcrafted script. </div></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Challenges: Visual Complexity</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">The basic structures of CBML were based on representative samples of common and relatively simple structures and panel layouts. For instance, panels normally are arranged in fairly regular grid patterns. 2 x 3 panel grids (three rows of two rectangular, nearly square panels) are very common; 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 layouts are also prevalent. 
                    <div id="figure28" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure28.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure28.jpg" alt=""/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 28. </div>A page from the Captain America feature in <cite class="title">Tales of Suspense</cite> #84 (Dec. 1966) by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby illustrates a very regular 2 x 3 panel grid.

                    But variation from strict and regular grid layouts is ubiquitous. Panels of every size and shape—circles, triangles, irregular polygons, and fluid organic shapes—are also common, as are borderless panels with ambiguous boundaries. <div id="figure29" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure29.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure29.jpg" alt=""/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 29. </div>Two

                    Simplistic approaches to encoding the spatial and sequential relationships among such panels are foiled by frequent variations and complexities in panel size, shape, and arrangement and particularly by ambiguous sequential positioning of panels. As determination of meaning in a textual document is dependent on a particular, usually obvious, sequence of words, so is determination of meaning in a comic book dependent on a particular sequence of images and panels. While a meaningful panel sequence in comics is usually apparent, the conventions of graphic expression in comics are not as fixed, well established, or as well known by general readers as the conventions for textual expression and narrative. And just as writers and poets break rules and conventions, so do comics writers and artists play with the rules and conventions of comics  narrative. In <a class="ref" href="#figure30">Figure 30</a> below, a single obvious sequence of panels is not at all clear—multiple valid sequential readings are possible. Also note the playful use of diegetic text, with bibliographic information about the creators and title of the story embedded in the pictures. Near the upper left of the page is a blue-tinted panel with the names of the creators of the story: "LEE STERANKO SINNOT ROSEN in Another Epic!" The title of the story, "Tomorrow You Live Tonight I Die!," appears on a calling card in the panel at the lower right-hand corner of the page.

                </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p54">Irregular and unusual panel arrangement, composition, and presentation may pose challenges for "reading" of the visual and textual language of comic books, just as difficult syntax, unfamiliar vocabulary, neologisms, or unconventional typography and punctuation may present challenges for reading primarily textual content. Most comics have panels with clear borders and generous gutters between borders. The borders and gutters between panels correspond to the punctuation and spacing used to enhance clarity and readability in written and printed texts. Panels without clear borders and gutters introduce another type of visual ambiguity in comics. <a class="ref" href="#figure31">Figure 31</a> illustrates a panel group with discreet pictorial moments that correspond to panels, but these "panels" lack conventional borders and gutters. 
                    <div id="figure31" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure31.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000117/resources/images/walsh_2012_figure31.jpg" alt=""/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 31. </div>One of many interesting examples from Will Eisner's influential <cite class="title">Comics &amp; Sequential Art</cite>, this page is composed as one blended graphic lacking common panel borders and gutters. Nonetheless, the larger image may be broken down into smaller sequential visual and textual gestures that correspond closely to conventional comic book panels. On the left is the original page; on the right, I have superimposed boxes over the image to identify the discreet moments or "panels" present in the larger composite image. [<a class="ref" href="#eisner1985">Eisner 1985</a>, 75]</div></div>
                    At least six such pictorial moments or "panels" may be identified in Eisner's page from <a class="ref" href="#figure31">Figure 31</a>. The top of the image depicts a man and woman running through Charles de Gaulle Airport; the next element shows, from a distance, the couple as they ride up an escalator. The lines of the escalator tube, extending more or less horizontally across the entire page, cause this image to serve simultaneously as a discreet pictorial moment <em class="emph">and</em> as a border or gutter separating the "panels" above and below the escalator scene. Two more "panels" are found directly below the escalator. On the left, the couple rush through the crowded airport; on the right, they arrive at their seats on the plane they have been rushing to catch. A very subtle "panel" emerges quietly below these two panels as the aircraft, seen from a distance, takes off through the clouds. Like the distant view of the escalators, this image does double duty as "panel" and as border/gutter. In the final "panel" of the page, the man and woman, reclined in their seats, relax and resume their conversation. In those images (the escalator and the ascending aeroplane) that function as both panel and border/gutter, we might say, borrowing terminology from textual criticism, that the substantive content has merged with the accidentals of the document. By encoding these graphic and textual moments within <span class="monospace">&lt;cbml:panel&gt;</span> elements, the scholar encoder has imposed an interpretation and asserted various claims about the document. Additional <span class="monospace">@ana</span> attributes might be used to indicate those "panels"  that function as both panel and border/gutter. <span class="monospace">&lt;note&gt;</span> elements might also be used to discuss other issues related to the general graphic ambiguity of the page.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55">In <a class="ref" href="#figure26">Figure 26</a> above, we saw an example of a speech balloon crossing the gutter from one panel into another. Another type of visual ambiguity is introduced when pictorial elements cross panel boundaries and co-exist is more than one panel. Since different panels often depict different physical spaces and different moments in time, the presence of a pictorial element in more than one panel can be particularly jarring and can be used to establish complex spatial and temporal relationships. <a class="ref" href="#figure32">Figure 32</a> below shows an example of this type of visual ambiguity in an early WWII-era comic book:

Pictorial elements, such as the gun in the fifth panel and the purple-suited figure and motion lines in the bottom two panels, cross the gutter separating

                    spatial and temporal juxtapositions and facilite visual transitions from panel to panel, breaking down the clear separation of narrative moments and instigating a flow approaching (though still very far removed from) the rapid frame-to-frame transitions found in film.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p56"><a class="ref" href="#figure33">Figure 33</a> below, from Morrison and Jone's <cite class="title">Marvel Boy</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#morrison2000">Morrison 2000</a>], shows a more recent example of a page with both ambiguous panel boundaries and overlapping panels. The central action—of the blue-cloaked golden figure lifting Marvel Boy into the air—is witness to its own genesis, visually encroaching on the panel depicting some moments prior in time. As Marvel Boy is lifted up into the underlying panel he becomes a spectator—with the reader—of himself within the previous moment. Likewise the blue-cloaked figure plants a golden boot upon a future moment that proceeds from the central action. An encoded CBML document might identify and analyze such transitions. One could develop a taxonomy to classify the sorts of overlap phenomena found in <a class="ref" href="#figure32">Figure 32</a> and <a class="ref" href="#figure33">Figure 33</a> and use the TEI <span class="monospace">&lt;interGrp&gt;</span> and <span class="monospace">&lt;interp&gt;</span> elements and the <span class="monospace">@ana</span> attribute, discussed above, to describe and interpret the graphic features and the resulting spatial and temporal relationships.

While these issues are not unique to comics, I would argue that the degree of complexity is distinct in comics. Comic books typically contain serialized narratives. Often one finds "stand-alone" issues, which contain a complete story, and often stories extend over many issues, or even many issues of two or more serial titles.<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e1724">[17]</a> In the case of mainstream super hero comics, regardless of whether any particular story is more or less self-contained within a single issue or extends over many issues, these narratives exist in the context of larger narratives developed over many decades by dozens or hundreds of individual writers and artists. Rather uniquely, characters like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, and the Hulk exist in ongoing, decades-long, cross-generational narratives created by collaborative teams of writers, artists, and editors. Although we find similar issues of long-running narratives with changing collaborative teams in film and television, none approaches the longevity and frequency of production found in the comic book narratives.<a class="noteRef" href="#d149e1736">[18]</a> Most long-running comic book features, from Fawcett's original Captain Marvel to Spider-Man to Archie, have complex bibliographic histories involving networks of changing titles, creators, even publishers. These complex bibliographic histories, with multiple creators, are relevant to textual theories about the nature of authorship and the social and corporate nature of document production. In comic books we have examples of collaboratively-produced narratives coupled with collaboratively-produced visual art. The many metadata structures available in TEI lend themselves to description of these complex bibliographic histories and relationships.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">The evolution of characters over many decades in serialized tales poses documentary complications that may be addressed through encoding strategies.  For instance, one may be interested in the DC super hero known as the Flash. The general concept of a super hero named the Flash, with the power of super speed, published by the comic book publisher DC, is some sort (or some sorts) of bibliographic entity—a character, a subject, a title. But there is not one Flash character (or title) in the DC imaginative universe. The first Flash, with the secret identity of Jay Garrick, was created by Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert in <cite class="title">Flash Comics</cite> #1 (January 1940). This character was revived in the 1950s, with a new costume, new origin story, and new secret identity—police scientist Barry Allen. Allen "died" in the 1985 series <cite class="title">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite> and remained "dead" for over twenty (real—not fictional) years  . During Allen's absence, his similarly super-powered sidekick Wally West took on the persona of the Flash, as did Bart Allen, Barry Allen's grandson. Many other characters have undergone similar evolutions and transformations.

Although many diverse examples have been shown here, the extent of textual and graphic variation found in the world of comics is astounding. Examples here have focused on superhero comics, the most enduringly popular genre in the history of the art form. However, many other important genres exist—romance, war, horror, science fiction, and fantasy comics—each with their own traditions and conventions. Increasingly, more realistic narratives, autobiographical works, and non-fiction works are presented as comics. Japanese manga and manga-influenced comics are very popular and possess a style and conventions distinct from western comics. Certainly many more difficult and challenging comic book documents will be found to test the general applicability of CBML and suggest additions and modifications to the markup language.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">An important issue, not yet addressed in this discussion, is the issue of copyright. Modern comic books, which developed in the 1930s and since, are largely still under copyright protection. The most popular of these, those featuring the famous super heroes, are owned by massive media conglomerates. DC Comics (publishers of titles featuring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, etc.) is owned by Time Warner.  Marvel Comics (publishers of titles featuring Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, the Hulk, etc.) was recently acquired by the Walt Disney Company. These media companies have reputations for jealously and fiercely protecting their copyrights. Copyright is doubtless a challenge for scholars studying comic books, just as copyright is a challenge for scholars studying film and many other twentieth- and twenty-first century works. But barring further restrictive copyright legislation, many of the older comic book publications will be entering the public domain in coming decades. Under current U.S. Copyright Law, <cite class="title">Action Comics</cite> #1 (June 30, 1938), featuring the first appearance of Superman, would enter the public domain in 2033, 95 years after publication. And many comic books from the same period are already in the public domain because the copyright was not renewed, when such renewal was still necessary for an extension of copyright protection. In 2008, publisher Image Comics began their Next Issue Project, a series of new comics based on the narratives and characters from comic books published in the 1930s and 40s that had fallen into the public domain. The first Next Issue Project comic book was <cite class="title">Fantastic Comics</cite> #24 [<a class="ref" href="#fantastic_comics24">Fantastic Comics 2009</a>]. It draws on stories and characters from Fox Feature Syndicate's <cite class="title">Fantastic Comics</cite>, the final issue of which was #23, published in November 1941. The Next Issue Project has identified a number of other public domain titles, including Lev Gleason Publications' <cite class="title">Silver Streak Comics</cite> (twenty-three issues), Quality Comics' <cite class="title">Crack Comics</cite> (sixty-two issues), and Harvey Comics' <cite class="title">Speed Comics</cite> (forty-four issues). These four titles alone provide over 150 comic books that could be used for further collaborative development of CBML and published on the Web and in other media. Certainly there is a great deal more comics content in the public domain or for which permissions may be secured, and nothing prevents a scholar from applying CBML markup to any text as part of a strategy for reading, interpretation, and analysis. The end goal of markup is not and should not always be publication of a digital surrogate. The encoding of a text may be a rigorous intellectual activity that has great value as process, not just as product.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">CBML, as described here, focuses primarily on overall structure of the document, textual content, and metadata. Significant work remains to be done giving similar attention to the pictorial dimensions of the comic book. I have argued above that CBML should not attempt to go too far in description of individual images and pictorial details, relying instead on the presence of facsimile page images. Nonetheless, in order to analyze the visual grammar and conventions of comics, additional visual and pictorial features will need to be "identified explicitly in order to facilitate processing by computer programs"[<a class="ref" href="#tei2010">TEI 2010c</a>]. Future work on CBML will include modeling frameworks for analysis of pictorial and graphic features and developing taxonomies for identifying such features, beyond the basic structural components of panels, balloons, captions, and sound effects.
                </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">Comic books are an endlessly fascinating medium and one from which the digital humanities can learn a great deal. The structural complexities of the content rivals or surpasses the complexity of content famously treated by digital humanities scholarship: fragmentary classical texts; medieval manuscripts; Blake's illuminated work; and Rossetti's double works. The combination of text and pictures and the role of visual communication in comics prefigures the multimedia and new media of digital environments and the prominence of pictures, graphics, and icons found on the Web and other modern digital interfaces. The corporate and collective authorship of many long-running comic book narratives and the interactive relationship between creators and readers/viewers/consumers of created content provide models of authorship and readership that are relevant to the collaboratively created digital content that we make and study in the digital humanities.
