His work is centred on computing across the arts, humanities and interpretative social sciences. 
Because computing is a techno-scientific activity this work is also concerned with and looks for 
collegial help from the sciences. Hence it leads to questions of interdisciplinary research as a whole, 
especially how such research is to be understood and done. More information is available
