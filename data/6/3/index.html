                  This extended interview with Ray Siemens was carried out on June 21st at Digital Humanities 2011, Stanford University. 
It explores Siemens' early training and involvement in the field that is now known as digital humanities. He recalls that his first 
experience with computing was as a video gamer and programmer in high school. He had the opportunity to consolidate this early experience in the mid-1980s, when he   
attended the University of Waterloo as an undergraduate in the department of English where he undertook, inter alia, formal training in computing. He communicates strongly
the vibrancy of the field that was already apparent during his graduate years (up to c. 1991) and identifies some of the people in places such as the 
University of Alberta, University of Toronto, Oxford, and the University of British Columbia who had a formative influence on him. 
He gives a clear sense of some of the factors that attracted him to computing, for example, the alternatives to close reading that he was able to 
bring to bear on his literary research from an early stage. So too he reflects on computing developments whose applications were not immediately foreseeable, for example, 
when in 1986 he edited IBM's TCP/IP manual he could not have foreseen that by 1989 TCP/IP would be firmly established as the communication protocol of the internet. 
He closes by reflecting on the prescience of the advice that his father, also an academic, gave him regarding the use of computing in his research 
and on his early encounters with the conference scene.

                 John Unsworth recounts that he first became involved with computing in the Humanities c.
                    1989 as a new faculty member at North Carolina State University where he was
                    hired to teach post-World War II American literature. He and his colleagues
                    wanted to set up a new journal as only one other journal existed in that area.
                    They were introduced to the recently released LISTSERV software and the first
                    issue of the journal was circulated on email lists and bulletin boards. It was
                    called <cite class="italic">Postmodern Culture</cite> and twenty-two years later is still published by Johns
                    Hopkins University Press. It was the first peer-reviewed electronic journal in
                    the Humanities; nevertheless, not all senior colleagues were in favour of it
                    and, as a junior faculty member, his participation in it. He recounts that was
                    not able to avail of formal training in computing but he did have technical
                    knowledge of computing, mostly picked up while procrastinating on this PhD. By
                    the early 1990s he was reading Humanist and attending conferences that focused
                    on electronic journals where he encountered a range of academic and non-academic
                    projects. In 1993 he moved to the University of Virginia where he directed the
                    Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). He reflects on the
                    wide range of people and projects that he worked with and that it was around
                    this time that he became involved with the community now known as digital
                    humanities. He reflects in detail on the first digital humanities conference he
                    attended in Paris in 1994 and concludes by discussing some of the changes that
                    the advent of the Web has heralded.

                 Harold Short recounts that his interest in Computing and the Humanities goes
                    back to when he was an undergraduate in English and French at a university in
                    the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). There, whilst undertaking summer work in the
                    library, he saw first-hand the potential of digital methods. After arriving in
                    London in 1972 he took an Open University degree in mathematics, computing and
                    systems. Among his early influences he identifies the reading he did on matters
                    related to cognitive science whilst undertaking a postgraduate certificated in
                    education. In the UK he worked at the BBC as programmer, systems analyst and
                    then systems manager. In 1988 he moved to King's College London to take up the
                    post of Assistant Director in Computing Services for Humanities and Information
                    Management. One of his first tasks was to work with the Humanities Faculty to
                    develop an undergraduate programme in humanities and computing. The first
                    digital humanities conference he attended was the first joint international
                    conference of ALLC and ACH, held at the University Toronto in 1989, which c. 450
                    people attended. He reflects on aspects of the institutional shape of the field
                    towards the end of the 1980s, including the key Centres that existed then, the
                    first meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC)
                    and those who were active in it such as Roy Wisbey, Susan Hockey and the late
                    Antonius Ampoli. He gives a detailed discussion of the development of what is
                    now the Department of Digital Humanities in King's College London, both in terms
                    of the administrative and institutional issues involved, as well as the
                    intellectual. He also reflects on some of the most successful collaborations
                    that the Department has been involved in, for example, the AHRC funded Henry III
                    Fine Rolls project, and the conditions and working practices that characterised
                    them. He closes by discussing his impressions about the movement of scholars
                    into and out of the discipline and of the institutional issues that have
                    had an impact on digital humanities centres.

                 This interview was carried out with Willard McCarty on Tuesday 27th March, 2012 in University College London. 
He recounts that his earliest encounter with computing was in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkley where he worked with semi-automated 
scanning equipment for the Alvarez high-energy physics projects. After his dreams of becoming a physicist were thwarted he transferred to Reed College. 
There he did not have the opportunity to take formal training in computing; for the most part, Computer Science departments did not exist then. 
So, he learned to programme on the job with help from a talented physicist turned computer programmer named Bill Gates (no association with Microsoft). 
His first encounter with what we now call digital humanities was at the University of Toronto where he worked on the Records of Early English Drama project 
whilst undertaking a PhD on 17th century non-dramatic poetry. In 1984/5, as he was finishing his PhD, he accepted an academic support role at the Centre for 
Computing in the Humanities at Toronto, where he remained until 1996 when he accepted an academic post in King's College London. In Toronto he was keenly 
aware of the staff-faculty divide and the marginalised position of those who used computers in Humanities research. Nevertheless, the opportunities that 
the role brought to meet with a range of scholars interested in computing had a lasting influence on him. So too, with funding from the Social Sciences 
and Humanities Research Council of Canada he was able to undertake a research project on Ovid's <cite class="italic">Metamorphosis</cite>. He closes the interview by reflecting 
on his early involvement with the conference scene and people who have influenced him, from academics to his calligraphy teacher Lloyd Reynolds.

                    formal training in computing. He bought his first computer, an Apple II clone,
                    after graduation when he was working as a teacher in the Middle East. Throughout
                    the interview he reflects on the various computers he has used and how the mouse
                    that he used with an early Macintosh instinctively appealed to him. By the
                    mid-1980s he was attending graduate school in the University of Toronto and was
                    accepted on to the Apple Research Partnership Programme, which enabled him to be
                    embedded in the central University of Toronto Computing Services; he
                    went on to hold a full time position there. Also taking a PhD in Philosophy, he
                    spent many lunch times talking with John Bradley. This resulted in the building
                    of text analysis tools and their application to Hume's <cite class="italic">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</cite>, as well as some of the
                    earliest, if not the earliest, conference paper on visualisation in the digital
                    humanities community. He reflects on the wide range of influences that shaped
                    and inspired his early work in the field, for example, the Research Computing
                    Group at the University of Toronto and their work in visual programming
                    environments. In 1994 he applied, and was hired at McMaster University to what he believes was the first job openly advertised as a humanities computing position in Canada. After exploring the opposition to computing that he encountered he
                    reflects that the image of the underdog has perhaps become a foundational myth
                    of digital humanities and questions whether it is still a useful one.
