                    tools have remained a fringe element in humanities scholarship. As the 2005
                    Summit on Digital Tools at the University of Virginia found, "only about six percent of humanist scholars go beyond general
                    purpose information technology and use digital resources and more complex
                    digital tools in their scholarship"[<a class="ref" href="#summit2006">Summit 2006</a>]. Although this percentage is probably higher now, it
                    is still far lower than most digital humanists would prefer. Such low adoption
                    has led to some questions about how much adoption is a priority for tool
                    builders, such as how much effort tool builders put into getting their tools
                    used by practicing scholars [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2008a">Bradley 2008a</a>]. More recently, another
                    study indicated that only about half of tool developers considered the number of
                    users that adopted a tool as an indicator of a success, only about a third ran
                    usability studies, and a disappointing 14% conducted surveys about the tool [<a class="ref" href="#schreibman2010">Schreibman and Hanlon 2010</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Lack of adoption has remained a difficult problem to solve, partly because it has
                    been unclear how scholars expect tools to behave, how they want to interact with
                    different kinds of tools, and how they perceive their present and future
                    utility. Funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities has allowed the
                    Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media to extend and formalize some of
                    its ongoing dialog with users about the general usability of a handful of
                    research tools for digital history, especially for text-mining and
                    visualization — two of the more active areas of inquiry and tool development in
                    recent years.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Through an open-ended survey and a virtual panel discussion, our interested but
                    skeptical audience provided their take on the usability of digital tools and
                    resources targeted at historians. The results of the survey and panel discussion
                    reveal the variety of users interested in digital tools and their expectations,
                    as well as the typical confusion that perhaps has created barriers to tool use
                    and to wider adoption of new research methodologies. Although our results are
                    neither comprehensive nor definitive, we hope that the comments and attitudes of
                    the users will help tool builders produce more effective and more widely used
                    tools for humanities research. We recognize that history is a diverse field, and
                    that comments from comparatively few cannot possibly represent the views of all
                    historians. Nevertheless, we think our results help elucidate the needs and
                    expectations of a broad scholarly audience.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">We provide more details about the survey and panel discussion in the following
                    sections, but a quick overview here will highlight some of the most important
                    findings. Our survey revealed that most respondents use technology to speed up
                    existing research practices — a result that has serious consequences for tool
                    builders who are trying to encourage new research methodologies. Builders must
                    be acutely aware that tool users have not necessarily made any commitment to
                    neither the tool nor the methodology, but are merely exploring research
                    possibilities. At least in our survey, when the utility or payoff was not clear,
                    our users tended to get frustrated and abandon the tool. With this in mind,
                    digital humanists should refrain from complaining about the limited acceptance
                    of their methodologies when the tools that are meant to promote them remain
                    inaccessible to a more general humanities audience.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Our panel discussion echoed what others have written prescriptively about tool
                    building, and, unfortunately, suggested that the digital humanities community
                    has not made substantial progress on these fronts. In 2003, when John Unsworth
                    called for digital humanists to better "demonstrate the
                        usefulness of all the stuff we have digitized," the number of available
                        tools was far fewer"[<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2003">Unsworth 2003</a>]. But even with more and better tools today, tool
                    builders need to ensure that exactly what their tools offer is crystal clear.
                    Our survey also reiterated the need for "community building
                        and marketing functions" as "few projects do the necessary branding,
                        marketing, and dissemination" required for substantial adoption"[<a class="ref" href="#cohenetal2009">Cohen et al 2009</a>]. The voices of our respondents nicely complement the
                    advice delivered in a relatively recent CLIR report directed toward digital
                    humanities centers [<a class="ref" href="#zorich2008">Zorich 2008</a>]. Because many more tools are
                    being produced outside of DH centers, and the user base has broadened even
                    further, getting the expectations and complaints of users in their own words
                    perhaps will help to provide a clearer path forward for tool builders.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Not long ago, Christine Borgman argued that "until analytical
                        tools and services are more sophisticated, robust, transparent, and easy to
                        use for the motivated humanities researcher, it will be difficult to attract
                        a broad base of interest within the humanities community"[<a class="ref" href="#borgman2009">Borgman 2009</a>]. Our results suggest that tools do not need to be
                    more sophisticated (because this increases skepticism and decreases the
                    possibility of a modular approach to building and using simple, intuitive
                    tools), but that ease of use and transparency are far more important. Overall,
                    our respondents were frustrated by a number of their expectations going
                    unfulfilled, namely intuitive interfaces, clear documentation, real-world
                    examples, and help with understanding how a given tool interfaces with data. But
                    it is perhaps best not to think in terms of ease of use and transparency as
                    features of a tool, but rather in terms of how tool builders attempt to engage
                    and develop a relationship with tool users. Building on the sentiments of one of
                    our respondents, we have organized our remarks below around the principle that
                    tool builders must consider themselves as entering into a social contract with
                    tool users. We highlight below what we consider the key features of this
                    contract.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Taken as a whole, the tenor of the responses suggests that digital humanities
                    tool development projects ought to increase the scope of their imagined
                    audience. Tool interfaces must help more "traditional"
                    historians feel more comfortable with new ways of visualizing, analyzing, and
                    thinking about sources and about data. Furthermore, the envisioned audience
                    should not only be those trying to use the tool, but those trying to understand
                    what it can do and why it matters. Even scholars who are disinclined to use such
                    tools themselves ought to be able to understand what it is that other people are
                    doing with them and how their sophisticated use might well constitute valuable
                    scholarship in itself.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Survey of existing practices</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">We first developed a survey that allowed a diverse group of historians to voice
                    their interests, concerns, and views about digital research methodologies. We
                    published the survey openly online, and invited participation through the
                    popular History News Network and through direct solicitations of graduate
                    history departments. Our 213 respondents (mostly from North America and Western
                    Europe) were about equally split between graduate students and professors at
                    various stages of their careers. These historians shared roughly 500-word
                    reactions and thoughts about their experiences using digital tools in their
                    research. Our aim was to provide a space for historians to present their own
                    ideas, not simply an opportunity to agree or disagree with our ideas, or to
                    simply select from predetermined choices as per a formal survey. In other words,
                    this was a qualitative rather than a quantitative survey. As such, we asked our
                    participants to answer a set of six open-ended questions about how they used
                    existing tools and resources, and the extent to which these tools and resources
                    met their needs. Below we summarize the most common sentiments relating to how
                    these historians viewed their own tool use.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9"><span class="label bold">Technology is used principally to speed up traditional research
                        methodologies.</span> When asked to "give examples of
                        how digital resources and tools are allowing you to do research (and to
                        learn things) that you couldn’t have done ten or twenty years ago"
                    our historians gave two primary responses. First, they focused on ease of access
                    and the way in which various databases allow them to more quickly access things
                    they would have otherwise walked to the library for. As one user reported,
                        "I start with Google to get sense of what might be out
                        on the web and then I go to specific resources that I know of such as the
                        IMB, WorldCat, etc." Second, they reported that they use Google and
                    Google Books to track down unusual terms and unique quotations. Much like
                    Patrick Leary described in his 2005 article, "Googling the
                        Victorians," these historians use Google search and Google Books as a
                    means to find references to obscure people and events [<a class="ref" href="#leary2005">Leary 2005</a>]. One typical response: "If I type a person's name or
                        event (especially obscure ones) into Google books, I can find works outside
                        of my major field that make reference to them."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10"><span class="label bold">Extensive use of Google and JSTOR suggest that resources should be visible
                        with high- level searches.</span> When asked "which
                        online or digital resources have you used in your scholarly research and
                        writing," almost all resources mentioned are repositories of either
                    primary or secondary source material. Google services were mentioned a total of
                    100 times by 70 participants, and JSTOR was mentioned 99 times by 98
                    participants. 72 participants made reference to "library" or "libraries" sites, 20 of
                    which were references to the Library of Congress Online Catalog. For comparison:
                    25 participants mentioned ProQuest, 23 mentioned ARTstor, and 19 mentioned
                    Wikipedia. One of the key reasons individuals gave for using these specific
                    sites was their ease of use; individuals reported feeling lost on many other
                    sites that did not offer an intuitive interface. Users reported that they were
                    generally unwilling to dig deep into sites to find information. In short, the
                    lesson here is that information needs to be visible with high-level
                    searches.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11"><span class="label bold">Respondents preferred quantity to quality with digitized primary and
                        secondary sources.</span> Those surveyed expressed overwhelming gratitude
                    for the availability of online primary and secondary source material. In
                    contrast to other disciplines like philology or textual criticism, where exact
                    transcription is crucial, historians frequently preferred resources that offer
                    large quantities of materials with even a crude full-text component. This
                    sentiment likely reflects their primary use of technology, namely that finding
                    references and information is a much higher priority than using tools to analyze
                    primary sources (which generally requires greater textual fidelity). At the same
                    time, the respondents were concerned about gated access to resources and the
                    quality of the resources that are freely available online. Respondents referred
                    several times to the adage "you get what you pay for"
                    in reference to the quality of non-copyrighted materials that are often used to
                    create full-text resources. This was in reference to the fact that many easily
                    available texts are late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century editions or
                    translations that have been superseded by more recent scholarship. But because
                    these older ones are now in the public domain, they can be scanned and ingested
                    into large repositories like the Internet Archive.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12"><span class="label bold">Knowledge of digital tools for historical analysis has not become very
                       widespread.</span> While our respondents were excited about repositories of
                    primary source materials online, they made little comment about a need for, or
                    interest in, any specific tools to help make use of these archives in novel
                    ways. With the exception of a few mentions of Zotero (11) and Endnote (5), there
                    was no mention of third-party tools, or of methodologies involving text or data
                    analysis and visualization. Nor was there significant mention of any emergent
                    technologies, like projects and standards that leverage the semantic web for
                    information discovery. This might suggest that there is little general interest
                    in such tools and technologies, but as our panel discussion (as described below)
                    suggests, the average historian might be considerably more interested in using
                    digital tools for research than has been recognized.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Overall, the results confirm what one may have expected: the uses of
                        <em class="term">digital tools</em> among our respondents are of the most general
                    kind: Google searches and the use of digitized primary and secondary sources. On
                    one level, then, many historians use tools for little more than speeding up
                    their existing practices. However, the emerging practice of using Google
                    searches to find obscure terms in obscure texts from other disciplines suggests
                    that even basic search technology is expanding, even if only slightly, standard
                    historical methodologies. As these historians try out searches for terms in the
                    corpus of books Google has digitized they are integrating this digital corpus
                    into the hermeneutic process of testing ideas, theorizing about the past, and
                    even conceptualizing a new kind of historical archive.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Panel discussion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14"> To explore more deeply scholars' perspectives on the potential value of specific
                    tools, we convened a smaller panel from the survey participants by emailing all
                    those who responded to the survey and asking for more involved participation
                    over a longer period of time. Over the course of four months the self-selected
                    panel discussed seven different specific digital tools at <a class="ref" href="http://nexthistory.org/" onclick="window.open('http://nexthistory.org/'); return false">nexthistory.org</a>, generating 130
                    comments about the utility and usability of the tools. All questions were posed
                    to the entire panel. Even though the number of panel participants does not
                    constitute an especially large sample size and cannot possibly represent all
                    historians, the comments they produced were remarkably consistent and revealing.
                    We think that the concerns they expressed are broadly relevant for tool building
                    in the digital humanities, especially history. Our criteria for what might be
                    counted as a "tool" were broad, and it could be
                    argued some of the "tools" that our panel evaluated
                    aren't best called tools at all (in some cases perhaps a platform, or a
                    particular visualization, for example), but we decided to include a variety of
                    freely available web services that could potentially help historians manipulate
                    and understand historical texts or data. We thought that a broad definition of
                    tool would yield the most robust feedback that could speak to the variety of
                    tools now being produced rather than to a narrow subset of them. Comments from
                    the respondents add some specificity to some previous surveys, such as a CLIR
                    report on digital tools, which employed an even larger definition of "tool" and focused on accessibility [<a class="ref" href="#shilton2009">Shilton 2009</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">We chose to solicit comments on tools that we thought together represented a wide
                    range of design, functionality, sophistication, and that showed promise of
                    applicability to a variety of fields within history and across other
                    disciplines. Each of these tools has indubitably advanced both practice and
                    theory in the digital humanities, and any criticism of individual tools and
                    projects (both here and from the panel discussion itself) should not detract
                    from the important contributions these tools have and will continue to make to
                    the field. Without such tools already in place, it would be impossible to have a
                    practical discussion of ways to make tools even better and more widely used. Nor
                    is this to say that these tools have been judged more important than others that
                    were not discussed. However, we do not believe that having chosen more or other
                    tools would have solicited substantially different feedback.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">A number of the tools focused on visualization. Many respondents mentioned that
                    the ways in which they were prompted to think about visualizing their data was
                    quite useful to them in ways that they did not expect. "Thinking through what I might do and how I might present it," wrote
                    one respondent, "...has helped to sharpen my analysis of my
                        research and find areas where I need to or would like to know more."
                    Another panelist, thinking even more broadly, "...could
                        imagine a visualization that might alter some of the standard
                        narratives." On the other hand, panelists also revealed how striking
                    visualizations are not necessarily inspiring to those who would prefer to
                    continue thinking in terms of texts. Regarding the <a class="ref" href="http://benfry.com/traces/" onclick="window.open('http://benfry.com/traces/'); return false"><cite class="title italic">Favoured Traces</cite></a> visualization that
                    shows how <cite class="title italic">On the Origin of Species</cite> changed from one
                    edition to the next, one commenter lamented a distancing from the real text:
                        "I guess I do not see how it would work. The information
                        is shown as flashing lights, rather than the actual text and I did not see
                        anything that looked like page numbers." Such a sentiment serves as a
                    reminder that users may expect to see traditional devices like page numbers,
                    even with online texts or visualizations for which they are not entirely
                    appropriate. Interface designs conscious of such users will help more "traditional" historians feel more comfortable with new
                    ways of visualizing, analyzing, and thinking about sources.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">As some of the above quotations suggest, the tools that had the most positive
                    feedback were the ones that easily allowed historians to develop quick views of
                    their data from multiple perspectives — especially if the tools demonstrated
                    potential to help historians navigate the overwhelming amounts of material that
                    they had accumulated. Users wanted to explore and play with ideas quickly. In
                    fact, they commented on how they much preferred "easy access"
                    tools to those that created (or tried to create) a polished visualization. One
                    of the more popular, if simple, examples was <a class="ref" href="http://www.wordle.net/" onclick="window.open('http://www.wordle.net/'); return false">Wordle</a>, a tool that helps visualize
                    word frequency within a given text with a stylish word cloud. One user commented
                    that the ease of use made him want to explore more about how he could use
                    linguistic analysis in his historical research: "If I had
                        done this at the beginning of my research of these texts, it might have
                        inspired me to take my analysis in a different direction." Especially
                    for their ability to generate quick views of data, respondents were enthused
                    about the teaching potential of the tools for giving quick impressions of texts
                    in the classroom. This sentiment signals that the classroom may be an excellent
                    place to encourage use of some of the more straightforward tools, even if in a
                    limited capacity. With familiarity and comfort, a user might well begin to push
                    the tool a bit harder for their own research purposes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Beyond the benefits of quick visualization, however, users found more to dislike
                    than to like about the tools overall. This appears less a result of the
                    tools per se than of the substantial gap between what the user expected the tool
                    to do (though this generally came from the tool documentation — more on this
                    later) and what the user could get it to do. Comments suggest that our
                    non-technical users either could not generally appreciate what several of the
                    more complex tools were designed to do, or were unable to recognize their
                    potential value in historical research. They complained that much of the
                    documentation was written in a highly technical fashion, and was virtually
                    unintelligible to them. Many panelists struggled with <a class="ref" href="http://seasr.org/" onclick="window.open('http://seasr.org/'); return false">SEASR</a> (The Software Environment for the
                    Advancement of Scholarly Research), which provides a range of text analysis
                    tools in a virtual environment. Although the website has some helpful videos and
                    other well- written descriptions, the overall documentation was considered to be
                    far too technical. One panelist remarked that using the site "felt as if I was testing for a foreign language test without
                        enough study." In many cases, individuals had little ability to
                    imagine what any of the individual tools might be truly useful for. One of the
                    most commonly expressed sentiments was a variation of the statement expressed
                    most succinctly by one panelist: "I think it will be useful,
                        but I’m not sure how yet."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">In order to help bridge the expectation gap, one panelist cogently suggested that
                    tool builders ought to think about their work as establishing a social contract
                    between them and the user. For a user to even consider using a tool, the tool's
                    website needs to establish that the time devoted to deploying it will generate
                    results that warrant the investment. One user wrote, "So I
                        think that the continued creation of these tools is really important, and
                        think that they need to be explained, with some real-world examples, so that
                        we can have a better sense whether the tool can do what we want." In
                    short, users wanted the theoretical benefits spelled out in plain language
                    irrespective of discipline. Panelists both implicitly and explicitly suggested
                    that tool builders might pitch their tools in slightly different ways. They
                    might, for example, focus more on the immediate research convenience that the
                    tool provides. As one user commented, "I am skeptical that
                        it would reveal 'hidden information' — but if it
                        convinced me that I could save time — and that it was reliable and worked
                        across different languages — then I’d be all ears." Perhaps this is to
                    say that the language used to educate users about the tool needs to be different
                    than the language used to secure funding for a project. Grant language tends to
                    emphasize innovation and revolutionary benefits over more modest quotidian uses.
                    But it's the everyday uses that new users are more likely to find immediately
                    helpful to their own research. Although less impressive-sounding, a more
                    realistic description of the benefits and limitations could encourage wider
                    adoption of tools, especially considering that most users will not be prepared
                    to make sophisticated and revolutionary use of the tool right away.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Perhaps growing out of the confusion about the possible research utility of a
                    given tool, another common complaint was that the tools were not really doing
                    history, in the sense of creating meaning from data. In response to tools that
                    performed some kind of linguistic analysis, many users questioned how much data
                    analysis can tell us about content and meaning. In reference to SEASR, for
                    example, one panelist complained that "whereas it may help
                        determine frequency or clustering, it doesn’t tell me how or why. As I have
                        indicated with other mining tools, this kind of tool can only take me so
                        far, then I must consult other sources and methods to know how and why
                        something happened in the past." Similarly, there seemed to
                    be confusion about what the Favoured Traces website was meant to do or show. One
                    panelist felt compelled to point out that "it is really
                        better suited to directing you to portions to study more closely than it is
                        as a tool to actually do the studying." Such direction, of course, is
                    one of the main goals of the visualization. Similarly, there was also concern
                    that the use of these tools strayed too far beyond the fundamental purpose of
                    the humanities: "I could do with less jargon and more about
                        how to use it. I am suspicious of the flow charts, perhaps that’s just me,
                        but I thought the humanities are about matters that resist
                        measure-and-manage control."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Needless to say, these important epistemological concerns are neither new nor
                    exclusive to the digital humanities. What is worth noting, however, is that
                    users generally identified perceived shortcomings of textual analysis or
                    visualizations as problems with an individual tool, not with the methodology
                    itself. On one hand, their comments may be an inadvertent conflation of a tool
                    and the research methodology it facilitates. On the other hand, they may suggest
                    that our non-technical users have a fundamental misunderstanding of what
                    technology is truly capable of in terms of historical work. Perhaps they were
                    led to believe that the tools were capable of much more than they are — and
                    probably more than even the tools' creators would claim. For example, one
                    respondent asked if <a class="ref" href="http://corpus.byu.edu/time/" onclick="window.open('http://corpus.byu.edu/time/'); return false">Mark Davies's Time
                        Magazine corpus</a> (and the interface to it) constitutes "a successful interpretive tool in itself or only a step along
                        the way to understanding and interpretation." Not many tool builders
                    would likely claim that a visually attractive word frequency diagram could
                    possibly be considered a valuable interpretation in its own right. They must,
                    however, be aware of this mindset. Addressing it directly will help users
                    understand not only what the tools can actually do, but also what profitable
                    applications of the tool might be in the course of their research.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Social contracts between tool builder and tool user often center around using
                    data in new ways, and it was the "if you can get it to

                    difficulties surrounding data standardization became very apparent. When asked

                    scholar, and underscores the need for tools to help promote data literacy. Tool
                    builders must provide clear — but not overly simplistic — sample use cases that
                    illustrate the necessary preparatory steps for using data with a tool. These
                    tutorials must be in addition to tutorials on using the tool itself after data
                    has been properly prepared. <cite class="title italic">Many Eyes</cite>, for
                    example, largely assumes that one can and will figure out how to format the data
                    to get the desired representation. For the kinds of researchers who built the
                    tool (and perhaps its intended audience), it may be obvious how data must be
                    formatted, or intuitive to figure out. For our historians, however, such tools
                    were perceived as little more than a black box. Inability to represent the data
                    in different ways was thought to be the fault of an uncooperative interface
                    rather than a problem with how the data was uploaded. It seems that providing
                    more education about manipulating data is essential to improve adoption of tools
                    that depend on carefully formatted data. Recognizing that everyone has
                    idiosyncratic work habits, we do not suggest that everyone must organize data in
                    the same way. Rather, we hope that tools will begin to play a more active role
                    in educating users about the data formats most useful to the tool, and also in
                    providing examples of the most common transpositional steps required to
                    interface data with the tool.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Even if users were able to create visualizations, they were often unclear about
                    what to do with the tool output. One respondent lamented that "most of these [tools] just produced fairly pretty looking or
                        complicated displays that I couldn’t really figure out how to use. The
                        things that I am looking for are ways to take structured data, that I might
                        gather about events, organizations, people, etc. and create interactive
                        maps, or visualizations of the links between people." This is
                    obviously easier said than done. But this also suggests that because interaction
                    is crucial, the user-interface cannot be thrown together after the fact.
                    Furthermore, both the interface and documentation must err on the side of
                    obvious rather than clever. For example, several visitors to <cite class="title italic">Favoured Traces</cite> commented that they found it utterly
                    useless because you could not see the text itself, but only a representation of
                    it. In fact, simply hovering over the "visual text"
                    reveals the actual text, and not much more work by the user can deliver a file
                    of the entire edition.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Lessons from respondents</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">So much for the major criticisms from our panelists. With the goal of making
                    tools more easily adopted by the average historian, we have tried to distill the
                    suggestions from our users into a comparatively small set of considerations for
                    tool builders. These might be considered the key features of the contract
                    between tool builder and tool user. Most are not groundbreaking suggestions, but
                    they underscore the real needs of interested users — needs that have not been
                    adequately met. And as stated earlier, digital humanists should refrain from
                    complaining about the limited acceptance of their methodologies when the tools
                    and techniques that they have developed remain opaque or even unintelligible to
                    an interested, general humanities audience.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26"><span class="label bold">Tools have generally neglected the typical humanities user in their design
                        and documentation.</span> Builders of digital humanities tools, especially
                    those that deal with technically more sophisticated techniques, like text mining
                    and visualization, could considerably increase their tools' visibility and speed
                    of adoption with more attention to their user interface and clear instructions
                    with example use cases. The intended audience of most tools, to the extent that
                    a discernable one presents itself, seems to be technically sophisticated users
                    who are already sold on the value and utility of the tool and who are willing to
                    play around with the tool to get a sense of its possibilities. But as our
                    panelists' interests suggest, the potential audience is far larger. The
                    philosophy of "Don't Make Me Think" comes to mind as
                    the kind of usability experiences the participants expected [<a class="ref" href="#krug2005">Krug 2005</a>]. Scholars approach scholarly software as software first
                    and scholarship second. Any intellectual nuance that might be useful to the
                    visitor must come after having met their expectations for web and software
                    design. That means simply and clearly indicating what the tool is, how one uses
                    it, and making it as easy as possible for one to get started and to see some
                    initial results, even if only approximate, from the tool. While it is important
                    to minimize the black-box problem by explaining how the tool works, it is
                    equally important that such explanations don't crowd out a more basic
                    explanation for new users.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27"><span class="label bold">Provide concrete examples and explain the methodological value.</span> 
                    Documentation needs to be non-technical in two ways. First, and most obviously,
                    it must explain the basics of how to operate the tool, and it would be extremely
                    helpful to provide examples about using the tool itself — that is, to present
                    specific examples of analysis across several disciplines. The cost outlay to
                    create such content is not negligible, but the benefit would be
                    disproportionately high. As one participant noted, "I think
                        that the continued creation of these tools is really important, and think
                        that they need to be explained, with some real-world examples, so that we
                        can have a better sense whether the tool can do what we want." This
                    also suggests that users might benefit from some explanation about the tool that
                    could help them do things that they didn't know they wanted to do. The second,
                    and perhaps more crucial aspect of the documentation, will explain in general
                    terms how the methodology of the tool can be useful. This would provide
                    important motivation for the curious scholar who has come across the tool (or
                    has been directed to it) but remains skeptical of the value of a new
                    methodology. Documentation should explain, with examples, how the research
                    methodology that the tool embraces can be useful and appeal to users across a
                    variety of disciplines. Especially if tool builders typically see their role as
                    making a methodology more accessible to scholars, they should include some
                    justification and explanation of the methodology in their documentation. Even if
                    methodological diffusion is not the principal goal of the project, explicit
                    attention to it will only further the larger mission and adoption of the
                    tool.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28"><span class="label bold">Be clear about the limitations of the tool and set reasonable
                        expectations.</span> Though it may appear obvious to the technically
                    sophisticated humanist tool producer, tool introductions need to be clear that
                    the tools themselves neither function as substitutes for historical research nor
                    attempt to produce historical knowledge. It cannot be overemphasized to the new
                    user that the tools simply facilitate historical research by revealing trends or
                    themes that might have otherwise gone unnoticed, and that to interpret what such
                    trends or themes might mean remains the work of the historian. For the time
                    being, then, tool builders might tone down the rhetoric about the interpretive
                    power of the tools and how they can revolutionize research. Similarly, they
                    should be encouraging users to think more deeply about the way tools create
                    different views of, and interactions with, information which can then be
                    interpreted and used as a means for developing and exploring historical
                    arguments. Certainly, technically sophisticated users will have a better
                    understanding of how a tool works, and will use the tools in more complex ways
                    to facilitate their own analysis. But this should not be the only audience that
                    developers try to engage with.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29"><span class="label bold">Allocate more resources to user interface development.</span> The user
                    interface for many digital projects often seems developed as an afterthought,
                    thrown together after completing the core functionality. However, a truly good
                    user interface requires significant investment in design and development that
                    needs to be integrated into the project timeline and budget. It needs to be
                    flexible to accommodate expanding tool features. Scholarly software designers
                    should more consider the research on user-centered design approaches (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#brown2006e">Brown 2006e</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#garrett2002">Garrett 2002</a>]) and theories associated
                    with user experience. Development should also include extensive testing. The
                    bugs and crashes frustrated many panelists. Though some instability is
                    unavoidable with prototype tools, scholars were almost resentful that they had
                    invested time in a tool that was wasted out because of a critical failure, which
                    in turn lessened the likelihood they will return to the tool even after
                    stability is improved.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30"><span class="label bold">No tool is an island; tools must support combinatorial approaches to

                    sources become available online, data standardization becomes even more crucial.
                    To this end, tool builders might collaborate with data repositories and other
                    tools to encourage compatibility between different formatting standards. This is
                    not to say that all humanists and repositories must adhere to the same standards
                    or data formats. No single approach can possibly accommodate the myriad kinds of
                    resources and institutions that are making data available. But there is a
                    willing audience at hand, and some explicit training about data
                    standardization — especially since it's not exactly widespread in typical
                    humanities training — could offer a tremendous boost to tool adoption. Our
                    panelists were excited and inspired by the visualizations of <cite class="title italic">Shaping the West</cite>; their technological uncertainty
                    hardly deterred them from attempting new visualizations with <cite class="title italic">Many Eyes</cite>. However, data roadblocks were fatal. For
                    the former, users found that substituting their own standardized data was
                    impossible; for the latter, users found it too difficult to standardize their
                    data in an appropriate way. Similarly, tools need to be as interoperable as
                    possible, especially in terms of how they can import and export data. "People already have databases," lamented one
                    participant, "...it would be nice to have easy ways of
                        accessing the data." The larger sentiment was not just about access,
                    but also about sharing the data between tools.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusions: broader goals for digital humanities tools</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">The participants in our survey and our panel discussion showed a great deal of

                    Although their interest is demonstrable, unfortunately so is the insufficient
                    usability of many digital humanities tools. As our panelists indicated,
                    concerns about the extent to which digital humanities tool developers consider
                    what humanities scholars actually want to accomplish [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2004">Warwick 2004</a>] remain strong.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">From explicit statements alone, it appears that our scholars are about equally
                    divided as to whether widespread adoption of digital tools should happen in their
                    field of history. Perhaps this reflects optimist and pessimist points of view
                    about technological change generally. But what resonates most strongly from our
                    panel discussion is that virtually all of the participants reported at some
                    point a glimmer of hope with respect to how digital tools might help them to
                    research in new ways and re-conceptualize their work. Yet their frustrations
                    over steep (or insurmountable) learning curves considerably dampened their
                    hopes. At the same time, our panelists made clear that, if interesting results
                    could be produced in a short time, they would be inspired to use the tools even
                    more. Perhaps such rough and ready use should be a more explicit aim of digital
                    humanities tool development. With the first wave of digital humanities tools
                    having produced excellent experimental and prototypical work, the fundamental
                    barrier to wider adoption of digital tools seems to lie now in quality
                    interfaces, accessible documentation, and expectations management.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">Many tools now seem to downplay the importance of the user interface and
                    documentation with the implicit rationale that people who are really interested
                    in using the tool will figure out how to make the tool relevant to their own
                    work. Our survey and discussion shows that this is often not the case. There are
                    plenty of interested, curious, and technically capable humanities researchers
                    that have little time and patience for trial and error with new methodologies
                    when they are uncertain of their value. However, they remain receptive to the
                    possibilities offered by the tools. When considering a user sympathetic to the
                    promise of digital history tools, some leading by the nose is not only helpful,
                    but also necessary. An appropriate social contract is not just about writing
                    functional code, but also about creating an experience that helps mediate a
                    potentially uneasy relationship between data (regardless of representation) and
                    researcher.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">Furthermore, though often seemingly outside the scope of a tool-building project,
                    tools should not only document their functionality, but also should explicitly
                    encourage scholars to approach their work in new ways. And in the midst of
                    embracing new kinds of methodological challenges and cutting-edge tool
                    development, tool designers must not forget the importance of a simple and clear
                    user interface. It must not only make it easy to use the tool in productive
                    ways, but also explain what the tool is for, provide examples of how it can be
                    used, and give non-technical details about how it works in order to minimize the
                    skepticism of black-box analysis. Such ease of use will hopefully bring
                    increased integration of technology in humanities instruction, especially in
                    terms of research methodologies and awareness of the importance of data
                    standardization so that humanists are better able to communicate with
                    archivists, librarians, and technologists who tirelessly facilitate data

                    tool development projects ought to increase the scope of their imagined
                    audience. The audience for early tools was, and in some ways needed to be, other
                    technically sophisticated humanists. But the potential audience has broadened
                    considerably. Put another way, tool builders might consider both their tools and
                    their target audience as more transitory than revolutionary. Keeping the
                    cautiously optimistic user in mind would encourage a wider user base and
                    facilitate the traction of digital humanities methodologies. Traditional
                    humanists are willing to venture down the digital path, but they need to feel
                    comfortable along the way.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">An emphasis on cultivating a broader audience and new relationships with them
                    must be a concern not only for tool builders, but also for funders of such
                    tools, who must ensure that tools adequately account for the time and expense of
                    quality interfaces and documentation. Prioritizing a wider audience can help
                    further adoption of tools in general, and thus further the acceptance of their
                    use and development as comprising legitimate scholarly work. Even scholars who
                    are disinclined to use such tools themselves ought to be able to understand what
