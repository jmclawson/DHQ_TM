First, it describes how the project team sought to recruit volunteer transcribers to take part, and discusses which strategies were successes (and which were not). We then examine <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>'s results during its six-month testing period (8 September 2010 to 8 March 2011), which include a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of website statistics, work completed by the amateur transcribers, as well as the demographics of the volunteer base and their motivations for taking part. The paper concludes by discussing the success of our community building with reference to this analysis. We find that <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>'s volunteer transcribers have produced a remarkable amount of work – and continue to do so, carrying out the equivalent labour of a full-time transcriber – despite the nature and complexity of the task at hand.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Crowdsourcing is an increasingly popular and attractive option for archivists, librarians, scientists, and scholarly editors working with large collections in need of tagging, annotating, editing, or transcribing. These tasks, it has been argued, can be accomplished more quickly and more cheaply by outsourcing them to enthusiastic members of the public who volunteer their time and effort for free [<a class="ref" href="#holley2010">Holley 2010</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e108">[1]</a> Crowdsourcing also benefits the public by making available and engaging volunteers with material hitherto only accessible to diligent researchers, or with sources previously considered too complex for a non-expert to understand. A project like <cite class="title italic">Galaxy Zoo</cite>, for example, has successfully built up a community of more than 200,000 users who have classified over 100 million galaxies, thus supporting a great deal of academic research [<a class="ref" href="#raddick2010">Raddick et al 2010</a>]. Crowdsourcing aims to raise the profile of academic research, by allowing volunteers to play a part in its generation and dissemination.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The Bentham Project at University College London (UCL) sought to harness the power of crowdsourcing to facilitate the transcription of the manuscript papers of Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), the great philosopher and reformer. The purpose of the Bentham Project is to produce the new authoritative scholarly edition of <cite class="title italic">The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham</cite>, which is based in large part on transcripts of the vast collection – around 60,000 folios – of Bentham manuscripts held by UCL Special Collections.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e126">[2]</a> The Bentham Project was founded in 1958, and since then 20,000 folios have been transcribed and twenty-nine volumes have been published. The Project estimates that the edition will run to around seventy volumes; before the commencement of <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> around 40,000 folios remained untranscribed.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">This new edition of Bentham’s <cite class="title italic">Collected Works</cite> will replace the poorly-edited, inadequate and incomplete eleven-volume edition published between 1838 and 1843 by Bentham’s literary executor, John Bowring <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#schofield2009">#schofield2009</a></span>. The Bowring edition omitted a number of works published in Bentham’s lifetime, as well as many substantial works which had not been published but which have survived in manuscript; a forthcoming <cite class="title italic">Collected Works</cite> volume entitled <cite class="title italic">Not Paul, but Jesus</cite> – only a part of which was previously published by Bentham, and was left out of the Bowring edition altogether – will recover Bentham’s thinking on religion and sexual morality. This material has significant implications for our understanding of utilitarian thought, the history of sexual morality, atheism, and agnosticism. Bentham’s writings on his panopticon prison scheme still require transcription, as do large swathes of important material on civil, penal, and constitutional law, on economics, and on legal and political philosophy. In short, while Bentham’s manuscripts comprise material of potentially great significance for a wide range of disciplines, much of the collection – far from being even adequately studied – is virtually unknown. A great deal of work, both in exploring the manuscripts and producing the <cite class="title italic">Collected Works</cite>, clearly remains to be done.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The Bentham Papers Transcription Initiative – <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> – was established to quicken the pace of transcription, speed up publication of the <cite class="title italic">Collected Works</cite>, create a freely-available and searchable digital Bentham Papers repository, and engage the community with Bentham’s ideas at a time when they are of increasing contemporary relevance.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e156">[3]</a><cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> crowdsources manuscript transcription, a task usually performed by skilled researchers, via the web to members of the public who require no specialist training or background knowledge in order to participate. The project team developed the "Transcription Desk", a website, tool and interface to facilitate web-based transcription and encoding of common features of the manuscripts in Text Encoding Initiative-compliant XML. Transcripts submitted by volunteers are subsequently uploaded to UCL’s digital repository, linked to the relevant manuscript image and made searchable, while the transcripts will also eventually form the basis of printed editions of Bentham’s works.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e167">[4]</a> The products of this crowdsourcing will thus be utilised for both scholarly and general access purposes. <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> was established and funded under a twelve-month Arts and Humanities Research Council Digital Equipment and Database Enhancement for Impact (DEDEFI) grant. The funding period was divided into six months of development work from April 2010, and the Transcription Desk went live for a six-month testing period in September of that year.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e178">[5]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Crowdsourcing is becoming more widespread, and thus, it is important to understand exactly how, and if, it works. It is a viable and cost-effective strategy only if the task is well facilitated, and the institution or project leaders are able to build up a cohort of willing volunteers. Participant motivation in crowdsourcing projects is, therefore, attracting more focused attention. The teams behind the <cite class="title italic">Zooniverse</cite> projects have analysed the motivations and demographic characteristics of their volunteers in an attempt to understand what drives people to participate in online citizen-science projects, while the <cite class="title italic">North American Bird Phenology Programme</cite>, established to track climate change by crowdsourcing the transcription of birdwatchers’ cards, also assessed its participants’ opinions. Rose Holley has also offered several invaluable general insights on user motivation, drawing on the experience of crowdsourcing the correction of OCR software-generated text of historic newspapers at the National Library of Australia (NLA), while Peter Organisciak has provided a useful analysis of user motivations in crowdsourcing projects. [<a class="ref" href="#raddick2010">Raddick et al 2010</a>][<a class="ref" href="#romeo2011">Romeo and Blaser 2011</a>][<a class="ref" href="#phenology2010">Phenology Survey 2010</a>]<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#holley2009">#holley2009</a></span>[<a class="ref" href="#holley2010">Holley 2010</a>][<a class="ref" href="#organisciak2010">Organisciak 2010</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">However, <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> differs from previous crowdsourcing and community collection schemes, in that its source material is a huge collection of complex manuscripts. Though several projects have crowdsourced manuscript transcription, the material they have made available is generally formulaic, or at least reasonably straightforward to decipher and understand [<a class="ref" href="#weather">Old Weather Project</a>][<a class="ref" href="#indexing">Family Search Indexing</a>][<a class="ref" href="#war">War Department Papers</a>]. Transcribing the difficult handwriting, idiosyncratic style, and dense and challenging ideas of an eighteenth and nineteenth-century philosopher is more complex, esoteric, and of less immediate appeal than contributing to a genealogical or community collection.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">This paper describes how the <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> team sought to attract volunteer transcribers and build an online community. It outlines which strategies worked and which did not, and, drawing on qualitative and quantitative data, analyses the complexion of our volunteer base, comparing its demographic and other characteristics with those of other crowdsourcing projects. This evidence will shed more light on the nature of user participation, crowdsourced manuscript transcription, and provide guidance for future initiatives. Section one will describe our attempts to recruit a crowd and build a community of users; section two will analyse the make-up of this user base, and assess site statistics, user contributions, and motivations; and section three will consider the success of our community building with reference to this analysis.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Crowd or Community?</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Caroline Haythornthwaite has discerned two overlapping patterns of engagement in online "peer production" initiatives like <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>, distinguishing between a "crowd" and a "community". Contributions made by a crowd, which Haythornthwaite describes as "lightweight peer production", tend to be anonymous, sporadic, and straightforward, whereas the engagement of a community, or "heavyweight peer production", is far more involved. A community of volunteers engaged in the latter requires, Haythornthwaite suggests, qualitative recognition, feedback, and a peer support system. Contributors tend to be smaller in number, to be less anonymous, and to respond to more complex tasks and detailed guidelines. Heavyweight peer production might also involve a multi-tiered progress system to sustain motivation; a crowd on the other hand, is satisfied with quantitative recognition, perhaps in the form of progress statistics, and a two-tiered hierarchy such as that of contributor and moderator. These two patterns, Haythornthwaite contends, are often discernable within one project [<a class="ref" href="#haythornthwaite2009">Haythornthwaite 2009</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9"><cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> blends both heavyweight and lightweight peer production. We attracted an anonymous crowd of one-time or irregular volunteers, along with a smaller cohort of mutually supportive and loyal transcribers. We aimed to cast our net wide by opening the Transcription Desk to all, by creating as user-friendly an interface as possible, and by simplifying the transcription process as much as we could (Figure 1). But, as transcribing Bentham’s handwriting is a complex and time-consuming task which requires considerable concentration and commitment, we also tried to build a dedicated user community to enable sustained participation by, for example, implementing a qualitative and quantitative feedback and reward system. The following section will describe the strategies we devised first to recruit the crowd, and then to foster the community.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure01.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure01.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>The <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> Transcription Desk</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Recruiting the Crowd: The Publicity Campaign</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Our publicity campaign targeted a variety of audiences including the general public, academic community, libraries, archives professionals, and schools. We devised audience-specific tactics as well as more general strategies, taking advantage of services offered by UCL to help us implement our campaign; these included the various Media Relations, Corporate Communications, Outreach, Public Engagement, and Learning and Media Services teams. In devising these strategies we had to consider issues of cost and timing. <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> had a limited budget to spend on publicity – £1,000 – and, as our testing period was six months only, a short time-frame in which to execute the plan. Though we hoped to target the English-speaking world, many of our strategies were, by necessity, confined to the United Kingdom.</div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">The General Public</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">As a web 2.0 project, it was vital to have a visible and interactive online presence. We created a project blog which was regularly updated with progress reports, details of media coverage, and forthcoming presentations, and which linked directly to, and became the main entry point for, users to the Transcription Desk. We also utilised social media by creating a Twitter profile and a Facebook page, which were integrated into our blog and main Bentham Project website, which also prominently featured <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>. A Google Adwords account was created when the Desk went live in order to generate traffic which, owing to budget constraints, was established on a trial basis. We prepaid £60 on our account which was exhausted by the end of September.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Besides the web we attempted to generate awareness of the project through traditional media. With the help of UCL Media Relations, a press release was drawn up at the launch of the project in September 2010, and distributed to major British newspapers and magazines. UCL Corporate Communications assisted in designing a <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> leaflet for distribution, 2,500 copies of which were printed at a cost of £295 (excl. VAT). We distributed the leaflet at academic conferences and institutions in Britain, Europe, and Australasia, and the leaflet was also dispensed throughout the year at Bentham’s Auto-Icon in UCL’s South Cloisters.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e267">[6]</a><cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> was also promoted via a video produced by UCL Media Services, which was embedded into our websites, and hosted on UCL’s YouTube channel.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e284">[7]</a></div></div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">The Academic and Professional Community</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">At the outset, we believed that the academic and professional community would be the most receptive to our project. We targeted not just existing Bentham scholars, academics, and students with an interest in history and philosophy, but also those interested in digital humanities and crowdsourcing, palaeography, and information studies. We hoped to encourage a range of scholars to embed <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> in teaching and learning, thereby helping to build a dedicated user base and encourage Bentham scholarship.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">We considered placing advertisements in academic journals and more mainstream subject-focused magazines. However, an advert in a single journal, with a limited print run, would have swallowed up nearly half of the publicity budget, and we felt that free coverage in the national press would achieve greater impact. Therefore, in order to reach a potentially diverse academic audience, the press release was sent to, amongst others, <cite class="title italic">The Guardian</cite>, <cite class="title italic">TechCrunch</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The Register</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Wired</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Mashable</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Times Higher Education</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Times Educational Supplement,</cite><cite class="title italic">The Times</cite>, <cite class="title italic">BBC History Magazine</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">History Today</cite>. In July 2010 two articles mentioning <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> had appeared in the <cite class="title italic">Times Higher Education</cite>, and it thus seemed sensible to approach that publication in the hope that it would run a follow-up piece [<a class="ref" href="#mroz2010">Mroz 2010</a>][<a class="ref" href="#cunnane2010">Cunnane 2010</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">Notifications were sent to a large number of academic and professional mailing lists, online forums, and the websites of academic societies. Though some bodies failed to respond, most of those contacted circulated an announcement about <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> via their list or featured it on their websites. Besides these initiatives, project staff delivered presentations on <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> at several seminars, conferences, and workshops throughout the year.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e349">[8]</a> We also engaged in consultation with representatives from different repositories including the National Library of the Netherlands, The National Archives (UK), the Natural History Museum (UK), and Library and Archives Canada.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">To promote <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> to palaeography, information studies, and research methods students, we contacted individual academics, libraries, archives, and educational bodies including the Higher Education Academy History Subject Centre, Senate House Library, and The National Archives. This outreach was generally successful and met with enthusiastic responses, though The National Archives responded negatively, stating that only notifications relating to "government departments, archives and organisations directly relevant to the activities of The National Archives" could be posted on their site. On the recommendation of the HEA History Subject Centre, we created pages on the reading of historical manuscripts to demonstrate how <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> could be used as a tool in teaching and learning.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e369">[9]</a> The Subject Centre subsequently produced a review of the resource recommending its use for palaeographic and historical training in undergraduate History classes [<a class="ref" href="#beals2010">Beals 2010</a>]. Dr Justin Tonra, then a Research Associate on the project, also contributed a tutorial using <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> to <cite class="title italic">TEI by Example</cite>, an online resource run by the Royal Academy of Dutch Language and Literature, King's College London, and UCL.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e384">[10]</a></div></div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">Schools</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">At the development stage, project members anticipated that school pupils and their teachers, particularly those undertaking A-levels in Religious Studies, Philosophy, History, Law, and Politics, could be another potential audience, especially considering Bentham specifically features in the curricula for Religious Studies and Philosophy. Once the project got underway, it was tailored in such a way so as to attract schools and colleges. We created pages with information explaining how <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> related to relevant A-Levels and Scottish Highers, including reading lists and direct links to groups of manuscripts of relevance to particular areas of study.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e397">[11]</a> We aimed, moreover, to target school teachers and pupils through the media and the web.

A link to the Transcription Desk was later included on the school’s virtual learning environment. In order to attract more schools to the project we invited school groups to visit the Project to see the Auto-Icon, hear a short lecture, and participate in the transcription exercise. We drew up a letter outlining these details which we sent, along with the <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> leaflet, to c.500 state schools in London, the cost of printing and postage for which was around £360. Raines Foundation School in Bethnal Green, London, responded positively to the outreach letter and arranged a visit in November of A-level Philosophy students who participated in the initiative <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bennett2010">#bennett2010</a></span>.

The Transcription Desk was developed using MediaWiki, an interface familiar to, and easily navigable by, the millions of those who have browsed, used and contributed to Wikipedia. It was decided that offering remuneration for contributions would be contrary the collaborative spirit of the project, and so platforms such as Amazon’s <cite class="title italic">Mechanical Turk</cite> were discounted, in favour of open source software. An alternative approach would have necessarily limited participation in <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>, as well as the level of engagement with and access to material of national and international significance.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure02.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure02.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>The Transcription Toolbar</div></div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure03.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure03.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 3. </div>Transcribing and Encoding a Manuscript</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">The features of MediaWiki were utilised in an attempt to forge a virtual community engaged in heavyweight peer production. We provided detailed, clearly-written guidelines to explain the process of transcription and encoding, along with a "quick-start" guide to summarise the main points. Training videos and downloadable files were embedded in order to provide an audiovisual aspect to the learning experience, and an intuitive toolbar was developed so that volunteers otherwise unfamiliar with text encoding could add the relevant TEI-compliant XML tags at the click of a button (Figures 2 and 3). In order to give regular feedback to users and to provide a platform for shared resources, we included a discussion forum on the Desk’s main page where volunteers could swap ideas, ask questions, or make requests of the project editors. Each registered participant was given a social profile which could be left anonymous or populated with an avatar and personal information, including his/her home town, occupation, birthday, favourite movies, and favourite Bentham quotation (Figure 4). Each volunteer profile also included a personal message board and an "add friends" function; we hoped that registered users would be able to message each other privately or publicly and build up a cohort of transcriber friends. </div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure04.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure04.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div>Example of a <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> volunteer profile</div></div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure05.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure05.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 5. </div>The <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite><em class="term">Benthamometer</em> progress bar</div></div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure06.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure06.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 6. </div>The <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> Leaderboard</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">The project editors used the message function on a daily basis to communicate with and provide feedback to transcribers.

We wanted to engage the interest of amateur historians in <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> as well as to give our regular transcribers a chance to meet project staff.

Our approaches to the British media were largely in vain, while the American press – including the <cite class="title italic">Boston Globe</cite>, the <cite class="title italic">Chronicle of Higher Education</cite>, as well as the <cite class="title italic">NYT</cite> – reported on the progress of the project much more enthusiastically. We did not send out a press release in the United States or in Europe; the journalists who reported on <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> in the press and on the radio approached us for information, and in this regard, the blogosphere seems to have been an important means of attracting media attention. Other than sending out additional press releases in the UK, it is unclear what more we could have done to promote the project to the British media; it is also worth noting that historically, the Bentham Project has had trouble gaining media attention for Bentham studies. That said, the British press were not entirely unreceptive: an article on academic crowdsourcing, which included a report on <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>, appeared after the testing period, in the 11 September 2011 edition of <cite class="title italic">The Sunday Times </cite>[<a class="ref" href="#kinchen2011">Kinchen 2011</a>], while another small piece appeared in the November 2010 edition of <cite class="title italic">Wired</cite> for the iPad. It appears that it was traditional media in the United States – albeit their web presence – which was the most important recruiter of volunteers. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">Google Adwords was a failure for us as a recruitment strategy. Our advert was displayed 648,995 times, resulting in 452 clicks, but sent no visitors to the Transcription Desk. The team’s lack of experience in using Adwords may account for this failure; regardless, it was considered too costly an experiment to persevere. Social media such as Twitter and Facebook, while raising awareness of <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>, also appears to have had little impact in driving traffic directly to the site, despite staff using them on a routine basis for publicity, communicating with volunteers, and issuing notifications.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e859">[27]</a> Twitter, in particular, appears to have been more a means by which technology-savvy users have followed <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>'s progress, rather than acting as a recruitment method. Nevertheless, social media has helped to integrate the community to an extent, by providing a platform for editors to share results and keep volunteers and other parties informed.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">Time and budget constraints impacted upon the success of the publicity campaign. We spent around £800 of our budget, though the campaign cost more overall, as we used additional funds acquired through a UCL Public Engagement bursary and other sources. With more funds we might have been able to try different strategies, and a commercial advert in a history magazine might have been possible. It also took time for the press release, distributed at the launch of the Desk in September, to yield results. Project staff liaised with journalists soon after the launch but, owing to the production process, stories often did not appear for some time after. <cite class="title italic">Wired</cite> published its piece in November while <cite class="title italic">The New York Times</cite> article appeared on December 27th – unfortunately when project staff were on holiday and unable fully to capitalise on the publicity or deal with enquiries immediately – some months after the launch. Thus, the user base only started to grow, and regular participants emerge, as the project’s funded testing period moved into its final three months. </div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure10.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure10.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 10. </div>Means by which survey respondents first became aware of <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite></div></div><a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e888">[28]</a></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Who Were the Volunteers?</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">Analysis of user survey responses and user profile pages suggests that most of those interested in taking part in <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> were educated professionals (Figure 11).

Almost a tenth of respondents were retirees and – from information gleaned from their user profiles – it appears that at least two of the most active transcribers were retired, while the most prolific volunteer had taken a year out from study. None of the regular volunteers were university students, and nor were any school pupils or teachers; the outreach strategy to London schools thus failed to generate sustained participation. Only one school responded to the letter and, while the Raines Foundation School showed enthusiasm at their visit to the Bentham Project, there was no sustained activity on the site. With an enhanced publicity campaign and more time, we would have been able to expand our outreach to schools by targeting independent schools, which may have had more resources available to dedicate to such a project.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure11.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure11.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 11. </div>Education of <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> user survey respondents</div></div><a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e930">[31]</a><div class="table"><table class="table"><tr class="row label"><td valign="top" class="cell">Sector</td><td valign="top" class="cell">No. of respondents (<em class="emph">percentage</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Academia</td><td valign="top" class="cell">14 (<em class="emph">17</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Administration</td><td valign="top" class="cell">5 (<em class="emph">6</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Arts</td><td valign="top" class="cell">8 (<em class="emph">10</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Civil servant</td><td valign="top" class="cell">3 (<em class="emph">4</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Editing/publishing</td><td valign="top" class="cell">8 (<em class="emph">10</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Engineering</td><td valign="top" class="cell">2 (<em class="emph">2</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Finance</td><td valign="top" class="cell">3 (<em class="emph">4</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">IT</td><td valign="top" class="cell">4 (<em class="emph">5</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Librarian</td><td valign="top" class="cell">1 (<em class="emph">1</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Project management</td><td valign="top" class="cell">1 (<em class="emph">1</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Psychiatrist</td><td valign="top" class="cell">1 (<em class="emph">1</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Researcher</td><td valign="top" class="cell">3 (<em class="emph">4</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Retail</td><td valign="top" class="cell">1 (<em class="emph">1</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Retired</td><td valign="top" class="cell">7 (<em class="emph">9</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Student</td><td valign="top" class="cell">15 (<em class="emph">18</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Teacher</td><td valign="top" class="cell">1 (<em class="emph">1</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Transcriber</td><td valign="top" class="cell">2 (<em class="emph">2</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Unemployed</td><td valign="top" class="cell">3 (<em class="emph">4</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell"><span class="hi bold">Total</span></td><td valign="top" class="cell"><span class="hi bold">82 (<em class="emph">100</em>)</span></td></tr></table><div class="caption"><div class="label">Table 2. </div>Occupations of <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> user survey respondents</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Holley found that while the age of crowdsourcing volunteers "varies widely", the most active were mainly "a mixture of retired people and young dynamic high achieving professionals with full-time jobs"[<a class="ref" href="#holley2010">Holley 2010</a>].

Those responding to our survey reported that they were mostly motivated to take part by a general interest in history and philosophy, in crowdsourcing and the technology behind the project, and in Bentham himself (Figure 13). A significant number cited contributing to the greater good by opening up Bentham’s writings to a wider audience as a motivation, and several even found transcription fun! Though our survey sample is relatively small, similar findings by others examining participant motivations suggest that the results are sound. Peter Organisciak found that primary motivational factors included subject matter, ease of participation, and a sense of making a meaningful contribution, while the top five NLA text correctors cited their enjoyment of the task, interest in the material, recording Australian history for posterity, and providing a "service to the community" as their main motivations for taking part [<a class="ref" href="#organisciak2010">Organisciak 2010</a>, 83–88]<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#holley2009">#holley2009</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p54"><cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> consciously implemented means to encourage volunteers through friendly competition, or what Romeo and Blaser describe as "game like mechanics"[<a class="ref" href="#romeo2011">Romeo and Blaser 2011</a>].

Other crowdsourcing projects have considered such features to be important, and it was thus surprising that <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> volunteers regarded "competition" and "recognition" to be of such low importance.

Two transcribers were excited by working on manuscripts which may not have been looked at since Bentham wrote them, while contributing to the accessibility of the digital collection and the production of the <cite class="title italic">Collected Works</cite> was also a factor for some.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1535">[45]</a> One volunteer notably described <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> as a "literary form of archaeology":
               <blockquote><p>Instead of using a brush to uncover an object, you get to uncover historical information by reading and transcribing it.

When volunteers submit transcripts to <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>, they agree to the following disclaimer: <blockquote><p>You are contributing to an Open Access initiative. For the purpose of UK legislation, copyright for all materials within <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>: Transcription Desk, including this transcription, resides with UCL (University College London).

Users recognised that UCL had made freely available priceless manuscript material, a transcription interface and instructions, and that their work was a transcript of Bentham’s writing rather than original intellectual content. Such approval did, however, come with the proviso that the submitted transcripts would not be commercially exploited, and would remain accessible to all in the future; the free availability and long-term preservation of the transcripts in UCL’s digital repository certainly meets these requirements. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p59">59</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p59">The vast majority of those who visited the Transcription Desk did not become active users, and it is thus just as important to understand what dissuaded people from participating as it is to understand what encouraged them (Figure 14). Some were daunted by the task, or felt that their contributions might not be of sufficient standard to be deemed worthy. For example, one respondent noted that he had been unable to read Bentham’s handwriting "with enough clarity to be happy recording my guesses in an important academic project," while another "confess[ed] to being a bit intimidated […] fear of failure?" This is a shame, as any contribution to <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> is beneficial to the project; perhaps in the future the project team could provide more reassurance to volunteers that all efforts are valuable. Another respondent decided that she could not take part because "I need a paying transcription position"; <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> is in no position to offer remuneration, and – as discussed above – it was considered that offering money for participation would be contrary to both the project’s collaborative principles and spirit.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1581">[46]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p60">60</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p60">It is notable that no survey respondents mentioned the importance of feedback from project staff or prompt responses to submissions. However, we have discovered through correspondence and observation that volunteers greatly appreciate notifications as to whether or not their submissions have been accepted, as well as responses to email requests for further information. Indeed, volunteer enthusiasm can noticeably fall away when feedback and acknowledgement are not given, and we may have lost potential long-term contributors during the December break when staff were away. This suggests that project staff must devote time to answering queries from users and to maintaining social media features in order to facilitate interaction, otherwise the project can appear dormant, and volunteers may lose interest or feel disconnected and exploited.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">The single most important dissuading factor, however, for those who responded to the survey, was time, or rather the lack of it, in which to transcribe and encode, or learn how to do so. Reading and deciphering the manuscripts was found to be the main challenge: as one respondent replied, "[t]he real difficulty is in reading [Bentham’s] handwriting". Indeed, over half of respondents found that deciphering Bentham’s hand took longer than encoding. Though text-encoding was an additional complication to the process, encouragingly few survey respondents found it prohibitively difficult.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1592">[47]</a> However, this comes with the significant qualification that almost two-thirds of respondents found that it took some time to get used to the encoding process, and that a significant proportion thought they spent as much time encoding as they did deciphering Bentham’s handwriting.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1607">[48]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">Indeed, most free-text responses noted that encoding (and the extensive instructions on how to do so) were daunting to beginners, but that the process became reasonably straightforward with practice.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1623">[49]</a> Several respondents were not so sure: one believed there was "[t]oo much markup expected", another that encoding was "unnecessarily complicated", and one – who, unsurprisingly, is not a regular transcriber – found encoding "a hopeless nightmare" and the transcription process "a horror". To many, text encoding was simply a time-consuming complication and almost certainly dissuaded participation. As one respondent put it, <blockquote><p>The transcription process has been a little more complicated than I anticipated. I thought I would be able to type away but I have to learn a little more before I get started, so I’m not wasting anyone elses [sic] time.</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">Some proved very able at text-encoding, to the point where almost half of survey respondents were confident enough to type at least some tags manually rather than use the toolbar. However, the negative views of encoding are very real concerns which must be addressed when improving and refining the transcription tool.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1643">[50]</a> Indeed, the majority of survey respondents were unfamiliar with the principles and practice of text encoding before taking part in <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>, though with a few exceptions: some were aware of the basics through editing <cite class="title italic">Wikipedia</cite>, writing HTML, or using early word processors. One volunteer in particular noted, that "I’m part of the wiki generation -- we have encoding encoded into our blood".<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1658">[51]</a> While crowdsourcing projects should not underestimate the IT proficiency of their volunteers, or their ability to learn new skills, the task at hand should be made as simple as possible.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p64">As such, we made the transcription and encoding process, and the instructions, as user-friendly as we could given our requirements and our short time-frame. However, these survey responses and the project’s inability to retain all but a few long-term volunteers suggests that the task appeared too complex and time-consuming for many prospective volunteers. Though we can offer guidance and assistance to those attempting to decipher Bentham’s handwriting, evidently, simplification of the transcription process and instructions would improve user recruitment and retention. For example, the introduction of a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get interface, as an alternative to the transcription toolbar, with encoding occurring "under the hood", would prove an attractive option for many volunteers. They would then be able simply to concentrate on transcription without having to digest lengthy instructions [<a class="ref" href="#causer2012">Causer, Tonra and Wallace 2012</a>].</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure14.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000125/resources/images/figure14.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 14. </div>Factors which dissuaded survey respondents' participation in <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite></div></div><a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1686">[52]</a></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">User Interaction and Community Cohesion</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">Fostering a sense of community would, we hoped, stimulate participation by encouraging users to strive to achieve common goals. Our community building strategies, however, appear to have had limited success. For example, only one pre-existing transcriber attended the public outreach events held in May 2011. This transcriber did appreciate the opportunity to meet project staff and experience face-to-face interaction. Of course, the volunteers who live outside of the UK were inhibited from attending these events and thus were unable to integrate physically with the community. In terms of fusing the <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> community together therefore, this particular programme of public events was ineffective.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66">Furthermore, despite the project having integrated social media facilities into the Transcription Desk, there is minimal evidence of interaction between <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> users. We are only aware of a handful of occasions on which users have communicated publicly with each other via their user page, a transcript, the discussion forum, or the project’s Facebook page. While users may have exchanged private messages or emails, the survey results suggest otherwise: only one respondent reported that she had contacted another via their user page, two had done so via the discussion forum, and another via Twitter.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p67">67</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p67">This is surprising, as it was anticipated that users would demand such social functionality. Indeed, the <cite class="title italic">North American Bird Phenology Project</cite>'s survey respondents specifically requested a discussion forum to communicate amongst themselves, and the NLA was met with requests from text correctors to provide a facility by which users could contact each other [<a class="ref" href="#phenology2010">Phenology Survey 2010</a>]<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#holley2009">#holley2009</a></span>. Many of the major crowdsourcing projects have discussion forums in which volunteers are active to one degree or another.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1715">[53]</a> These are certainly busier than the <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> forum which – rather than being a space for volunteers – became merely another avenue by which users contact project staff or in which project announcements are made. Perhaps a larger volunteer community is required for the forum to be used to a greater extent.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p68">68</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p68">Moreover, by the end of the testing period, seventy-eight per cent of survey respondents stated that they had not added any information about themselves to their user profiles.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1735">[54]</a> A cursory look through registered users’ pages – even those belonging to super transcribers – reinforces the impression that volunteers are not particularly interested in social media facilities, or perhaps even being part of an online community <cite class="title italic">per se</cite>, as hardly any contain any information beyond a name and, in a few cases, a photograph or avatar. Survey responses suggest why this may be the case. One respondent had "added minimal information because I don’t know enough about the community […] to want to make my information available to others". Others were concerned that such information "seems unnecessary", that they were "[n]ot sure how this would be helpful", thought personal information would be "more interesting and useful to the T[ranscribe]B[entham] organization than to individual contributors", or didn’t see the feature as important. Two further respondents expressed doubts about the wisdom of putting too much "personal profile info on public sites", which may be a significant issue for future crowdsourcing projects seeking to create a community. Furthermore, while there have been technical issues with the site’s social features, transcribers do not appear too concerned about these problems as we have received no enquiries about their non-functionality.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p69">69</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p69">On the other hand, some wanted to know more about their fellow volunteers. One believed that "it is important for each person involved in the project to at least let us know their educational background and philosophy. It encourages discussion". Another thought that it "is only possible to create an online community if people are willing to say something about themselves". However, they were in a definite minority, with most seemingly uninterested in, or unaware of, the site’s social media capabilities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p70">70</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p70">Transcribers have proven wholly good-natured in going about their work: there have been a couple of easily-resolved but unintended revisions of others’ work, but certainly no evidence of "edit warring", repeated reversions, or arguments. There is certainly none of the overt territoriality exhibited in the tagging of text in one NLA newspaper, when an anonymous user requested a registered text corrector to "please refrain from appropriating and/or inserting any [text] correction or tag" concerning a particular historical figure, whom the anonymous user appeared to believe belonged to him or her.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1773">[55]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p71">71</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p71">That said, there is no evidence that <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>'s volunteers have collaborated directly upon manuscripts; rather, they participate in what might be termed unconscious collaboration, with volunteers sometimes adding another layer of work onto what went before. As one respondent to the survey suggested, it "[s]eems to me the whole system is a collaboration, since we’re encouraged to submit unfinished transcriptions &amp; others can work on them. Maybe a serial collaboration". Two respondents were unaware that direct collaboration was possible, while another did not "feel secure enough with coding to muck up someone else’s work", and presumably worked instead on unedited folios. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p72">72</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p72">Indeed, three-quarters of edited manuscripts were worked upon by only one volunteer, while relatively few manuscripts were transcribed by three or more. Those manuscripts transcribed by multiple volunteers were generally begun with by one or more new users and otherwise "abandoned", and later completed by a more experienced transcriber. This all suggests that volunteers appeared to prefer starting transcripts from scratch, and to work alone (Table 6), with communication and acknowledgement from staff being of much greater importance than collaboration with other users. This might appear counter-intuitive, as dabbling with partially-completed transcripts could allow volunteers to get used to the project and transcription process, and be less daunting than starting a transcript from scratch. The advent of the incomplete folios category in mid-January 2011 did see regular volunteers finishing partially-complete transcripts, though this option has not been popular with new volunteers, who seem to prefer to start with an untranscribed manuscript. Indeed, we have regularly received complaints from volunteers about being unable easily to distinguish between untranscribed, partially transcribed, and completed transcripts. Perhaps registration acts as a barrier to those who might wish to tweak a little bit of encoding or transcription here and there.</div><div class="table"><table class="table"><tr class="row label"><td valign="top" class="cell">No. of transcribers</td><td valign="top" class="cell">No. of manuscripts (<em class="emph">percentage</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">1</td><td valign="top" class="cell">753 (<em class="emph">74.6</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">2</td><td valign="top" class="cell">256 (<em class="emph">25.4</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">2</td><td valign="top" class="cell">753 (<em class="emph">74.6</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">3</td><td valign="top" class="cell">64 (<em class="emph">6.3</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">4</td><td valign="top" class="cell">16 (<em class="emph">1.6</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">5</td><td valign="top" class="cell">5 (<em class="emph">0.5</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">6 or more</td><td valign="top" class="cell">3 (<em class="emph">0.3</em>)</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell"><span class="hi bold">Total</span></td><td valign="top" class="cell"><span class="hi bold">1009 (<em class="emph">100</em>)</span></td></tr></table><div class="caption"><div class="label">Table 6. </div>How Many Volunteers Transcribed Each Manuscript?</div></div></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">4. Conclusion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p73">73</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p73">Through the intensive publicity campaign discussed above, the <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham </cite>team has successfully promoted its project, and crowdsourcing and manuscript transcription more generally, to a wide audience. Our findings may offer suggestions to those who plan to build volunteer communities for their own projects, and specifically for those looking to crowdsource more complex tasks like manuscript transcription rather than simple data entry or OCR correction. Some of our conclusions are derived from our volunteer survey; though the sample was relatively small, its findings are reinforced by analysis of volunteer transcriber profiles, statistical data from Google Analytics, and general observation of volunteer behaviour. Furthermore, that the survey results also fit into the broader narrative of discussions of crowdsourcing participants’ characteristics and motivations, also suggests that our findings are sound.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p74">74</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p74">We found that <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> volunteers were mostly well educated, often associated with academia or had a professional background, and had a prior interest in history and philosophy; many of the crowd also had an interest in digital humanities and were IT literate, but few were associated with schools. This highlights the importance of targeting the correct audience for the task at hand, in this instance, transcribing historical material. Most of the transcribers were recruited through online media, particularly the article in the <cite class="title italic">New York Times</cite>, which emphasises the importance of securing the attention of a major news organisation with both national and international circulation. Our press release was certainly worthwhile, therefore, though unfortunately the British press displayed a disappointing lack of interest in the story.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1889">[56]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p75">75</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p75">The crowd of users were generally engaged in lightweight peer production. Most contributed only once to the site and were most likely put off from further participation, our results suggest, by a lack of time, which, unfortunately, there is little we can do to solve. However, this was exacerbated by the complexity and difficulties involved in transcribing or encoding. The processes involved in such an endeavour need to be simplified as far as possible to ensure increased and ongoing volunteer recruitment and retention, and to make the most of their available time. Indeed, wasting the time of users is perhaps the worst sin any crowdsourcing project can make.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p76">76</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p76">Most of the <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham </cite>crowd failed to interact with each other, to use the social features of the site, or to respond to the stimulation we hoped would be provided by the Benthamometer and the leaderboard. Improved social features might facilitate interaction, though the survey results and observation of the site suggest they might not be that important to some volunteers. Direct collaboration – if thought desirable – could be further facilitated by improving the interface’s functionality, or by providing further instruction. Respondents to the survey suggested that we provide a way for the inexperienced to request help from other users – an experienced users’ contact list, for example. Giving experienced and motivated volunteers moderator status may be one way in which crowdsourcing projects could improve community cohesiveness, and is something we would like to explore in the future.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p77">77</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p77">Unfortunately, owing to <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>'s short time-frame due to the limited funding budget, the project was unable properly to benefit from many of its recruitment strategies; the impact of international press attention was only starting to be felt as the six-month testing period was ending. Too heavy reliance upon the media for publicising a time-limited project is a risk, as the timing of media attention is to a large extent beyond a project’s control owing to changing media deadlines and priorities. If a piece comes out too soon, a project may not yet be available to the public and the attention cannot be capitalized upon; too late, and volunteers brought to the project as a result may be alienated if a cessation of funding causes the end of user support.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p78">78</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p78"><cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>, for example, was gaining momentum just as it was obliged to scale back owing to the nature of the AHRC grant; editors were unable to provide the detailed feedback to volunteers as they had done previously. As the entire project is built on mutual trust between project staff and the transcribers, we felt duty-bound to inform volunteers that the fully-staffed testing period would end on 8 March 2011. Several volunteers who joined the project as a consequence of the <cite class="title italic">NYT</cite> publicity were hugely disappointed to learn of this only three months after they had first become aware of the project’s existence, and had invested considerable time and effort in taking part. A number, quite understandably, stopped taking part altogether. Our crowd of 1,207 users was not transformed, therefore, into a cohesive and active community.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1920">[57]</a> These results suggest that projects requiring a volunteer community must plan their publicity strategies effectively and, if they have only a short fully-staffed and fully-funded live testing period, well in advance and, where possible, in conversation with interested media. Advanced planning might not be possible, of course, if, like <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>, the fully-staffed development stage is relatively brief, or the project is funded through a scheme issued at short notice.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1938">[58]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p79">79</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p79">Though it was a little disappointing that we failed to transform most of our crowd into regular volunteers, this is not necessarily a disadvantage for a community-based project. Various crowdsourcing projects have found that only a minority of users carry out most of the work, and so it proved with <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>; a small but remarkably active core of super transcribers became engaged in heavyweight peer production, providing a large quantity of transcripts. Community projects engaged in similar work must, however, be prepared and have the means to support this core group. Our super transcribers appreciated communication with and advice from staff, occasionally interacted with other users on the Transcription Desk and via social media, though few have populated their social profiles. One super transcriber attended the public outreach events held in May and evidently appreciated the opportunity to meet project staff in person, and at least one other responded positively to the multi-tiered progress system. This suggests, perhaps, that "team-building" features and strategies, in spite of their lack of appeal to some, should not be dispensed with completely. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p80">80</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p80"><cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>'s volunteers produced 1,009 transcripts – or an estimated 250,000 to 750,000 words, plus mark-up – during the six-month testing period. On the face of it, this pales in comparison with the over 650,000 pages of ships’ logs transcribed by <cite class="title italic">Old Weather</cite> volunteers, the 36.5 million lines of OCR text corrected by volunteers involved in the NLA digitised newspaper collection, or the tens of millions of index entries keyed-in for Ancestry.com’s <cite class="title italic">World Archives Project</cite>. Yet, transcribing Bentham is more demanding than the often mechanical and repetitive tasks involved in other projects, and arguably lacks the more immediate popular and media appeal of citizen science and genealogy.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31714e1958">[59]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p81">81</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p81">Building a volunteer community to carry out complex tasks can be beneficial and rewarding to humanities scholars, particularly at a time when they are under pressure to ensure that their work has impact. Nevertheless crowdsourcing does not necessarily render research projects more economical. Aside from potential significant short-term costs in digitisation, creating and testing a transcription tool, and promoting the endeavour, some long-term investment will also be required. Time and money will need to be spent on interacting with volunteers, maintaining and developing the transcription interface in response to volunteer needs, continual promotion of the project, and checking and offering feedback on submitted work. The experience of running <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> suggests that it is only over time that building a volunteer community pays off; though <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> by no means enjoys mass participation, those taking part currently produce transcripts at the same rate as had the Bentham Project employed a full-time transcriber [<a class="ref" href="#causer2012">Causer, Tonra and Wallace 2012</a>]. <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> has also raised awareness of the Bentham Project and engaged the public with its research to a greater extent than it has ever done before; volunteer community-based initiatives thus have the potential to enhance the profile and broaden the scope of research projects.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p82">82</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p82"><cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>'s experience, then, demonstrates that there is an audience of potential volunteers who are willing and able to engage in more demanding crowdsourced tasks, such as transcribing complex manuscripts. With a sustained and targeted publicity programme aimed particularly at educated retirees, students, and the relatively computer literate, an intuitive transcription tool, a task made as straightforward as possible, and staff committed to providing feedback and stimulating interaction, crowdsourcing the transcription of manuscripts – even those as challenging as Bentham’s – can be a successful and rewarding venture for volunteers and researchers alike. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Acknowledgements</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p83">83</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p83">We would like to thank our <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite> colleagues: Philip Schofield, Justin Tonra, Richard Davis and his team, Martin Moyle, Tony Slade, and Melissa Terras; and to all of the volunteer transcribers who have generously given their time and effort, ensuring <cite class="title italic">Transcribe Bentham</cite>'s ongoing success.
