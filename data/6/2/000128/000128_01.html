Before he begins to write, he
                inscribes the first page with an epigram: "Still flowing". As anyone who has read
                Joyce’s fictions or critical writing will attest, his work is replete with multiple
                voices and narrative trajectories, a babbling stream of textual overflow interrupted
                at regular intervals by playful, descriptive whorls and eddies. If there is a common
                thread to be drawn between his hyperfictions, his academic writing and his novels,
                then it is this <em class="term">polyglot dialogue</em>, as Robert Coover terms it — a lyrical
                stream of consciousness. Joyce can tell a story. And he has told many stories: four
                books, forty scholarly essays, and at last count (my count), a dozen
                    fictions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e106">[1]</a> What courses through this
                work is a gentle concern, or even fixation, with how stories are told, with "how we make meaning, as if a caress" [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2004">Joyce 2004</a>, 45]. The metaphor of water is an appropriate one.
                Like Ted Nelson, who had his first epiphany about the nature of ideas and the
                connections between them as he trailed his hand in the water under his grandfather’s
                boat, Joyce has long been concerned with how to represent a multiplicity of ideas
                and their swirling interrelationships, with how stories change over time. In the
                essay "What I Really Wanted to Do I Thought",
                about the early development of Storyspace, Joyce writes: <blockquote><p>What I really wanted to do, I discovered, was not merely to move a
                        paragraph from page 265 to page 7 but to do so almost endlessly. I wanted,
                        quite simply, to write a novel that would change in successive readings and
                        to make those changing versions according to the connections that I had for
                        some time naturally discovered in the process of writing and that I wanted
                        my readers to share. [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1998">Joyce 1998</a>, 31]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">That novel, of course, would become <cite class="title italic">afternoon</cite>
                 , the world’s first hypertext fiction [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1987">Joyce 1987</a>]. The
                development of Storyspace is, at least in part, the story of Joyce’s quest to find a
                structure for what did not yet exist, or as he wrote in a lengthy document created
                at the time called the Markle Report (see note on sources<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e134">[2]</a>), to find "a structure
                editor...for creating 'multiple fictions'" [<a class="ref" href="#bolter1986">Bolter and Joyce 1986</a>, 12].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">As I have argued elsewhere,<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e171">[3]</a> the early hypertext systems were built to embody particular visions about
                how the human mind and memory work, to represent the "complex interconnections" that
                hold between ideas. Each system (re)presented a different model of these
                interconnections and of the perceived complexity underlying a mass of information.
                As Jay David Bolter put it in 1991, "electronic symbols...seem to be an extension of a
                network of ideas in the mind itself"[<a class="ref" href="#bolter1991">Bolter 1991</a>, 207] (also cited by [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1998">Joyce 1998</a>, 23]).
                Storyspace is no exception; Joyce intuitively felt that stories disclose themselves
                in their "connectiveness," and that "we are associative creatures. That’s what we
                do" [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>]. Unlike the hypertext pioneers van Dam, Engelbart, Nelson or
                Bush, however, Joyce is first and foremost a writer – and Storyspace was designed
                for writers. The image of potentiality that guided Joyce was consequently a literary
                one; it started with an idea for a novel.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In every interview Joyce has given about <cite class="title italic">afternoon</cite> or the
                development of <cite class="title italic">Storyspace</cite>, the leitmotif of a "story that
                changes each time you read it" returns like a Wagnerian melody. Joyce’s writing is
                filled with such recurrences, with images and phrases that return again and again;
                "recurrence is the sounding of memory in air," he writes in <cite class="title italic">Othermindedness</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#joyce2004">Joyce 2004</a>, 97]. As Stuart Moulthrop observed in response to this
                article, the name "Joyce" is also an echo, "an echo he won’t acknowledge for
                fear of trading on homonymity" [<a class="ref" href="#moulthrop2011">Moulthrop 2011</a>]. Joyce, keen as always to create a
                self-reflexive eddy in the text, has a response to that response)<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e219">[4]</a>. This particular image, the image of a multiple fiction, is important enough
                that it appears verbatim or near verbatim in many of his essays on hypertext (e.g.,
                [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1998">Joyce 1998</a>, 31][<a class="ref" href="#bolter1991">Bolter 1991</a>, 247][<a class="ref" href="#joyce2004">Joyce 2004</a>, 123] as a "multiple" story). </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Although he is quick to point out that "it wasn’t a matter of just bringing a set of
                ideals and aspirations to Bolter," and then building a system to do that [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>],
                the idea of a novel that changes with each reading was obviously important to him,
                based on its longevity in his own work. In our interview, he actually corrected my
                phrasing: "forgive this, this is like an English teacher, it’s not 
                    <em class="emph">every</em> reading in the sense of every different reader, but I said <em class="emph">each</em> reading, and I had in mind readers who would go back to
                a text again and again"[<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>]. If Storyspace has an origin legend, then it begins
                with this multiple fiction; in Vassar College’s version of the tale, Joyce "looked
                at his little Apple II in the early 80s and said I’ll bet you could do a story
                that would change every [sic] time you read it. He called around, looking for such
                software, and it didn’t exist"[<a class="ref" href="#vassar1992">Vassar College 1992</a>].
                Apocryphal stories aside, what is clear is that as a novelist, Joyce was thinking
                about the process of writing, and even more importantly, about the internal
                connections that exist in stories - connections that might, with the aid of a
                computer, be shaped by potential readers.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In the early 80s, as a classics professor working at the University of North
                Carolina, Chapel Hill, Jay David Bolter was also thinking about the computer as a
                writing space, and about the connections that hold between ideas. His department had
                been pioneering research into the computerization of classical scholarship since
                1975, led by David Packard (son of billionaire computing pioneer David Packard, Sr.,
                the co-founder of Hewlett Packard). Unlike his contemporaries, and crucially for the
                future of humanities computing, Bolter had a background in computer engineering. He
                completed a Masters in Computer Science in 1978 as well as a PhD in Classics in
                1977, both from UNC, and he was a member of the Committee for Computer Applications
                (APA) beginning in 1981<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e265">[5]</a>. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">As a classics student at UNC in the late 70s, he remembers in our interview,
                he was the "only student in the class who had a computer science background"[<a class="ref" href="#bolter2011">Bolter 2011</a>]. He
                became Packard’s assistant for a couple of years and worked on his pioneering
                mini-computer system IBYCUS. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">IBYCUS was the first computer to allow the editing, search, and retrieval of
                classical texts in a fully integrated desktop package<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e278">[6]</a>. When Packard left UNC, he left his computer there and Bolter was
                responsible for running IBYCUS for a few more years.<blockquote><p>This was really my first important humanities application and it was at that time
                that I started thinking about the impact of the computer as a technology, which led
                to my book <cite class="title italic">Turing’s Man</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#bolter2011">Bolter 2011</a>].</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Consequently, when he started working with Joyce in 1983, Bolter had already been
                thinking about the relationship between computing and classical scholarship for a
                few years<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e291">[7]</a>. Joyce remembers he "felt drawn to Jay’s vision because he was concerned
                with questions of how the epic narrator, how the Homeric narrator, adjusted stories
                so they changed"[<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Computing science was engaged in a love affair with AI in the 70s and 80s; it was
                particularly intent on modeling the perceived structure of the human mind and
                memory, imitating nature and improving on it (a topic that Bolter critiques in the
                first edition of <cite class="title italic">Writing Space</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#bolter1991">Bolter 1991</a>, 171175], unfortunately
                removed from the second edition published in 2001). Both Joyce and Bolter spent a
                year as Visiting Fellows at the Yale AI Project, Bolter from 1982 to 1983 and Joyce
                from 1984 to 1985. Bolter recalls there was "a general paradigm of representation
                that AI was following at the time, which was the concept of basically linked
                structures, interlinked structures, nets of ideas"[<a class="ref" href="#bolter2011">Bolter 2011</a>], a concept that was also
                central to Storyspace. "Crucially," he recalls, "the AI community didn’t see this as
                writing, they saw it as thinking, in other words they thought they were [actually]
                modeling the mind"[<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e326">[8]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">From 1980 to 1987, there was a second "boom" in this area and large amounts of money

                pull of it. In the Markle Report they note that their "collaboration stems from, and
                has been energized by, work in artificial intelligence"[<a class="ref" href="#bolter1986">Bolter and Joyce 1986</a>, 12]. It might be
                worth reflecting at this point that, whereas the project of hypertext has been all
                too successful with the proliferation of the web, AI remains arguably fictional<a class="noteRef" href="#d48284e343">[10]</a>. In the 1980s however, there was a brief resurgence of hope as the new

                is "nearly alone in artificial intelligence researchers in using the computer as a

                a story generation program called TALE-SPIN that attempted to simulate an author’s
                mind as she makes up a story [<a class="ref" href="#dehn1981">Dehn 1981</a>]. The ideal structure editor, write Bolter

                "This memory needs to contain not only facts about the storyworld thus far

                the author's life"[<a class="ref" href="#dehn1981">Dehn 1981</a>]. TALE-SPIN was an "AI attempt at story generation" by
                making up Aesop-fable-like stories that were the consequence of a particular
                storyworld. It was a world simulator, and this world included the characters that
                lived in it and their goals and motivations. TALE-SPIN behaved, in effect, like an
                author’s memory. It had to keep track of these characters and their specific
                environment, access the material, and reformulate the narrative based on these
                items. To explain and describe this process of reformulation and retrieval she also
                borrowed the term <em class="term">reminding</em> from Schank.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">For Roger Schank, <em class="term">reminding</em> describes the association of episodes in human memory,

                collaborating with Joyce in September 1983 [<a class="ref" href="#bolter1986">Bolter and Joyce 1986</a>, 10]. They would later have a
                profound influence over hypertext theory and criticism, and also the Storyspace
                system; from the outset, the nodes in Storyspace were called "writing spaces," and
                it worked explicitly with topographic metaphors, incorporating a graphic "map view"
                of the link data structure from the first version, along with a tree and an outline
                view (which are also visual representations of the data). "The tree," Bolter tells
                us in <cite class="title italic">Turing’s Man</cite>, "is a remarkably useful way of
                representing logical relations in spatial terms"[<a class="ref" href="#bolter1984">Bolter 1984</a>, 86]. Also in line with the
                topographic metaphor, writing spaces in Storyspace acted (and still act) as
                containers for other writing spaces; an author literally "builds" the space as she
                traverses it, zooming in and out to view details of the work, the map making the
                territory. This is an important point. "The whole thing about Storyspace was – the
                big thing about Storyspace [was] – you could write hypertext hyper-textually" as

                a visual and a verbal description," and the design of Storyspace reflected this; as

                to write a book that changed with each reading, as we have seen. According to the
                Markle Report, which was written entirely by Joyce even though Bolter appears as an
                author (see note on sources), he was also "insistent on the non-hierarchical and
                associative working habits" of writers [<a class="ref" href="#bolter1986">Bolter and Joyce 1986</a>, 24]. After they were introduced by
                Natalie Dehn in 1983, they quickly began "a deeply engaged discussion about
                storytelling and what kind of associative thinking we each understood"[<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>]. They
                didn’t have a formal model at the time, "not like a formal AI-like model or
                psychological model," just some concepts that were working through in their own
                writing. Joyce recalls that they would talk every day on the telephone, "this was
                well before we were habituaries of email," and that these discussions were thrilling
                for both of them; "it was the most profound intellectual period of my life"[<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>].
                In the manner of all great partnerships, the collaboration would change the arc of
                their creative vectors far into the future; Joyce would later have "trouble distinguishing where Bolter's thought leaves off and mine begins"[<a class="ref" href="#joyce1998">Joyce 1998</a>, acknowledgements].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">It is interesting to note that Joyce is still playing with the idea of memory and

                with his colleague Richard Grusin (2000), which developed a model for reminding in

                emphasize in our interview that he never believed hypertext to be any more than a

                computer science courses, and "linked lists obviously are the key to thinking about
                hypertext, if you want to implement it in the most obvious way"[<a class="ref" href="#bolter2011">Bolter 2011</a>]. GLOSSA was a
                basic implementation in this sense, based on Bolter’s experience with classical
                texts. "You’d tab a text and then you’d be able to associate notes with any

                mentions Adventure-type fictions as an influence in the Markle Report ([<a class="ref" href="#bolter1986">Bolter and Joyce 1986</a>, 19], although
                he also mentions numerous cultural and literary influences including the novels of
                Sterne and Joyce, Cortazar’s <cite class="title italic">Hopscotch,</cite> even jazz music).
                Neither Bolter nor Joyce believe, however, that they were influenced by
                Adventure-type games, except in the sense that they were "a kind of zeitgeist at the

                concerning the past - and data models are very hard to trace at any rate (they
                always reflect something else, popping up everywhere like the grin of the Cheshire

                games, namely linked lists. In other words, the tree-like structures were just part

                GLOSSA, was called TALETELLER, a name that stuck until 1985 (as Matthew Kirschenbaum
                observes [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>, 174]). Bolter had GLOSSA in hand when they first started
                collaborating, but its successor, TALETELLER, was a product of tinkering together.
                As Joyce recalls, "We would have these conversations, we’d talk about things, and
                [Bolter] would say 'let, let me try this in code,' and then shoot back something
                and say, 'Well, is this going to work?'"[<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>].

                mash of poetic handwritten text, symbols and logical notations, to explain his
                ideas. Given the lyrical, polyglot style of his fictions and critical work, we would
                expect no less in his technical projects; Joyce has always written to his own loony
                tune music, to paraphrase him in <cite class="title italic">Of Two Minds</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#joyce1998">Joyce 1998</a>, 181]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">In his book <cite class="title italic">Mechanisms</cite>, Kirschenbaum explains how this

                ampersand to indicate an AND condition [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>, 182]. Joyce thinks the
                process may have been a little more complicated than this, however, and that the
                pseudocode was more like a lyrical "mnemonic" than a draft or plan. The trope of

                Storyspace, reading and re-reading sequences, and experiencing guard field
                permutations, from the first. Indeed this was why, in your wonderful phrase [in the

                "sounding of memory in air"), phrases that appear again and again as the writing
                progresses, relying heavily on the reader’s own memory of previous instances of the
                same phrase or node to alter their present experience. He is hyperconscious of where
                the narrative has already been. Guard fields control a reader’s experience of the
                text based on where they have been. This is done by placing
                conditions on the activation of links, "preventing a link from being followed unless
                a specific node has been visited"[<a class="ref" href="#ryan1999">Ryan 1999</a>, 138]. The reader’s experience is thus
                literally as well as metaphorically shaped by the path already taken, enabling Joyce
                to repeat terms and nodes throughout the work and have them reappear in new
                contexts. Conversely, they enable Joyce to ensure that readers don’t access key
                nodes until they have seen or visited others; although the narrative seems to be
                following a path that may have been followed before, it changes slightly at the next
                turn.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">The most famous example of the use of guard fields is the "white afternoon" node in
                    <cite class="title italic">afternoon</cite>, the node that reveals that Peter may have
                inadvertently killed his own son. Hypertext critic Jane Yellowlees-Douglas (Joyce’s
                favourite reader, whose dissertation was on <cite class="title italic">afternoon</cite>) argues
                this node "completes" the work for her, but it is accessible only after the reader
                has seen a certain sequence of other nodes; "a succession of guard fields ensures
                that it is reached only after a lengthy visitation of fifty-seven narrative places"[<a class="ref" href="#yellowlees-douglas2004">Yellowlees-Douglas 2004</a>, 106]. Guard fields are a powerful device, and one that
                Joyce deploys to full effect in <cite class="title italic">afternoon</cite>. According to the
                Markle Report, Joyce "agitated" for them to be included in the design of Storyspace
                from the outset, and Bolter quickly obliged in their fledgling program:
            <blockquote><p>It was just a matter of putting a field into the link data structure that would
                contain the guard, and then just checking that field...against what the user did
                before they were allowed to follow the link... It was [that] idea you know and it

                Bolter and Joyce have always credited Smith as a coauthor of Storyspace, but Smith
                wanted to clarify in our interview that he wasn’t involved in the development of
                either TALETELLER or Storyspace — he feels he made more of an intellectual
                contribution insofar as "there was a sort of cloud of ideas that we were all drawing
                on in the discussions we’d have in this research entity at UNC, Textlab"[<a class="ref" href="#smith2011">Smith 2011</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">Textlab was comprised of three people from computer science including Smith, a

                issues around hypermedia, data structures and the visual representation of writing
                and thinking [<a class="ref" href="#smith2011">Smith 2011</a>]. Textlab was a very productive group, and they developed
                a number of hypertext systems between 1984 and 1989. Primary among them was the
                Writing Environment (WE), the system with which Smith was most closely associated.
                This expository writing system was contemporaneous with Storyspace.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">The development of the Writing Environment was central to these discussions; it was
                the major project concerning Textlab. WE was a hypertext system built for the PC
                explicitly designed in accord with a "cognitive model of the writing process"[<a class="ref" href="#smith1986">Smith et al. 1986</a>]. Unlike Bolter and Joyce, Smith and the
                rest of the WE team were "not interested in prose, in fiction". Designed to produce
                paper documents for professionals, users employed the system to represent their
                ideas as nodes, move them into "spatial" clusters, and link them into an associative
                network. Crucially, this network was not intended to be read at a screen like
                Storyspace fictions are. WE would assemble the nodes in sequence and print a linear
                document. If the user edited this tree structure, then the structure of the
                corresponding printed document would change. The model was derived from a review of
                the literature in cognitive psychology, composition theory, and the nascent field of
                Human Computer studies (this would become HCI). Bolter coauthored a seminal paper on
                WE in 1986 with Smith, Lansman, Stephen Weiss, David Beard and Gordon Ferguson, and
                contributed to its development. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">From the outset in the discussions this group were having, however, according to

                From early on, Bernstein sought to find and publish hypertexts because he felt the
                literary world needed some real examples; it was all hypertext theory, no "serious
                hypertext". As Stuart Moulthrop observed, in 1990, Bernstein stood before the
                European Conference on Hypertext and uttered the famous first words, "Where are the
                hypertexts?" – a question that is arguably still just as urgent. Eastgate was set up

                seen. This concept was invented by Bernstein, and eventually made its way into the
                Mosaic browser (Eastgate never implemented breadcrumbs in Storyspace). Possibly for
                this reason, Bernstein was initially more interested in signing Joyce’s hypertext
                fiction, <cite class="title italic">afternoon,</cite> than he was in Storyspace. As Joyce

                his engineering colleagues from the outset [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>]. Unlike Nelson and Engelbart, Bolter and
                Joyce were not ridiculed; on the contrary, they both felt embraced by computing
                science. This set a precedent for future work in the area. In fact, according to
                Joyce, "what has gone unremarked is Storyspace’s contribution to a dialogue, if not
                across the two cultures then at least across the engineering and literary
                communities"[<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011a">Joyce 2011a</a>].</div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d48284e106"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>Though in many cases the "critical" works are also fiction,

                    great importance to "primary evidence" — source material and documents that
                        were created at the time under study. Matthew Kirschenbaum notes in his
                        recent book, <cite class="title italic">Mechanisms</cite> (2008), "The single indespensible source for the
                        early history of Storyspace is Joyce and Bolter’s report to the Markle
                        Foundation, which funded Storyspace for a crucial development year in 1985" [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>, 172]. The copy I will be using here is held at the Michael Joyce Archives
                        at the Harry Ransom Research Centre, dated 1986 (hereafter "the Markle
                        Report"). The Markle Report was written during the first development cycle
                        for Storyspace, and describes both the research process behind the program
                        and the tool itself as it was used at the time over 60 typed pages; for this
                        reason, I will be relying heavily on it. That said, human memory is
                        fallible, but so are documents. The Markle Report was written mainly by
                        Joyce, and in the manner of any document assembled in haste and addressed to
                        a funding body, it presents a particular view of the task at hand (and
                        sometimes gets the minor details mixed up).<br/><br/>As Joyce put it when I
                        queried his use of some terms in the report, "I feel like I’m hoisting my
                        own petard, but obviously I wrote the whole Markle Report; my imprecisions
                        of language are coming back to haunt me" [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>]. To get a more detailed
                        picture I will be supplementing this source with oral histories obtained in
                        2011 – most particularly the recollections of Michael Joyce, Jay David
                        Bolter, John B Smith and also Mark Bernstein, who has maintained the code
                        for the last twenty years. Stuart Moulthrop and Nancy Kaplan have kindly
                        helped with some of the minor details, and Michael Joyce provided me with a
                        copy of his unpublished manuscript, <cite class="title italic">Re:mindings</cite> (he
                        was reluctant to part with this, but it is used by permission). I also rely
                        heavily on Joyce and Bolter’s critical work because this theory influenced
                        the development of the system.<br/><br/></div><div class="endnote" id="d48284e171"><span class="noteRef">[3]</span>[<a class="ref" href="#barnet2013">Barnet 2013</a>]</div><div class="endnote" id="d48284e219"><span class="noteRef">[4]</span>
