As virtual
          and technical interfaces intersect in increasingly complex formulations, the ability to
          identify organic vs. technical forms has become problematic. Virtual environments
          predominate within "everyday" cultural practice arguably limiting "real" or unmediated
          human experience. The advent of social media artifacts and networks in particular — those
          that create fusions of personal experience and communal activity and that support and
          broadcast user-generated content as a foundation for media productions of real-life — have
          made organic bodies and personal experience difficult to discern. </p><p>Extending Mark B.N. Hansen’s model for identifying embodied experience within
          contemporary "mixed reality" culture, I argue that embodied expression is more, not less,
          present in the contemporary media age. Organic expressions, those that emanate from
          primal, tactile, and motile forces and that operate prior to formal mediatization, are at
          the core of many social media artifacts circulated within the networks of contemporary
          culture and operating outside the aesthetics of traditional semiotic representation.
          Recovering the organic body and foregrounding its presence in such media asserts the
          functional non-aesthetic principles at work in many social media forms, particularly in
          those dependant on documenting the minutiae of real-life under-represented in mainstream
          and traditional media. As personal and public spaces collide, situating the "me" or the
          embodied subject within production is problematic. I identify such embodiment within
          contemporary social media, particularly on YouTube, to illustrate that the human body does
          not operate from a position of "erasure" within social media networks and artifacts, and
          its expressive value is therefore central in much current user-generated me-dia. </p></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In this age of heightened media and genre convergence, the depths and surfaces for
        considering the relationship between virtual and physical forms of embodiment require a
        nuanced perspective. The shift in media production and broadcast practices from
        predominantly mainstream outlets with mass audiences who consume professionally-developed
        content sourced from specialized technicians and technical apparatus has been radically
        altered. The introduction of Web 2.0 principles and practices and the development of social
        media networks in the late 1990s and early 21st century marked a definitive shift in the
        elemental foundations of digital media culture. User-generated content now circulates via
        internet technologies in dynamic micro-networks of equivocal exchange, bypassing industrial
        media methods and outlets for production, distribution, and exchange, while fusing producer
        and consumer into what Axel Bruns terms hybrid <em class="term">produsers</em><span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bruns2008">#bruns2008</a></span>. As the product and the producer converge, the
        (in)ability to clearly discern one from the other has extended theoretical considerations
        about real and virtual designations within internet-based technological and media
        innovations. In the decade before, in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, web-based
        media, along with digital art and hypermedia forms and applications, underwent fast-paced
        revision and innovative reconstruction. The methods of inscription and the expressive and
        creative capabilities for computer-mediated production reconfigured not only the
        technologies, but the complex cultural networks that supported them. As distribution
        practices enabled rhizomatic content structures (and infrastructures) and as convergent
        media forms proliferated, the bodies (text-bodies, author/user-bodies, machine-bodies, for
        example) engaged by these innovative transformations became increasingly complex. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Currently, digital media <em class="term">remix</em> culture is one where "real
          life" (RL) and "virtual life" (VL) structures have
        migrated more fully from the desktop to otherly-mediated life worlds, and they occupy all
        states in-between. The space one occupies, for example, in the <em class="term">twitterverse</em>,
        the term in common usage to describe the network engaged by the micro-blogging application
        Twitter, exemplifies such ambiguity and malleability. The term twitter<em class="emph">verse</em>
        itself underscores the conceptual pseudo-spatial dimensions it occupies. It evokes the
        materiality of planetary outer-<em class="emph">space</em>, as well as the universal expansiveness of
        the celestial bodies that orbit within the social media networks they engage, in infinite
        and intricate patterns, only partially discernible to the theoretician’s naked eye. One’s
        own <em class="term">tweets</em> (messages) are able to migrate from hand-held to desktop displays,
        confusing or eliding the site of real vs. virtual production. I can tweet my location,
        thereby affirming <em class="emph">my</em> presence in both real and virtual spaces, but also as part
        of a collective: "I (/We) am (/are) (t)here." Twitter content too
        is labile and may comprise numerous forms, modes of inscription, and states of being.
        The twitter user serves multiple functions, as: diarist; locative documentarian;
        disseminator of others’ content (via re-tweets); photographer or videographer; corporate
        mouthpiece, or pawn, circulating or advertising other media; or merely as a gateway or
        conduit to other equally distributed networks — to Facebook, YouTube, Flickr.
        Self-fashioning in social media is as fluid as the networks through which data circulates,
        and the possibilities for dis-<em class="emph">playing</em> one’s self, for performing one’s
        experiences, move far beyond the virtual identity crises and cyber-theatrics once reflected
        in the work of Sherry Turkle, Brenda Laurel and others to account for life on the
        screen-stage enabled by computer media. For Lawrence Lessig, the "hybrid
          economies" supported by the new social media networks are driven by their
        association with a slippery dialectic structure and ever-shifting oscillation between
        personal and private spaces, grassroots and corporate interests, and global vs. local
        community interests [<a class="ref" href="#lessig2004">Lessig 2004</a>]. Experiences are circulated through a
        variety of alternate, other, and liminal states of in-between-ness, and shifting allegiance.
        Uncovering the embodied source(s) of such highly convergent mediations and experiences
        necessitates new theoretical perspectives to account for organic vs. technical structures
        and for RL vs. VL constructions in an age where social networking practices intersect with
        personal expressiveness.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">To enable creative and critical expression and critique, and to address the texts and
        bodies supported by current emergent digital media forms, I propose the human body and its
        relation to technical mediation is a core site for investigation. An understanding of the
        human body, both as a stimulant for expressing organic forms of agency and production as
        well as a primal site from which to establish the dynamic dimensions of new technical
        interfaces, particularly the complex ones supported within socially networked media, is
        critical for future digital media studies. Embodiment as a state of organic (non-technical)
        and sensory being-ness — one that foregrounds its physicality and its tactility and serves
        as a necessary force for technical rendering, or representative mediation — cannot exist as
        a discursive abstract in contemporary media theory. Its conceptual position as a referent
        within representation (within traditional discourse), and therefore outside of the
        expressive, anti-aesthetic (social-)media politics informing emergent contemporary media
        forms, is not adequate to account for the primacy of the physical body. This organic
        reference point situates and contextualizes much of social media and its networks of
        exchange. Embodied expression, that is, organic communication that originates prior to pure
        external mediation, particularly prior to mediation through visual means, offers a
        provocative site from which to investigate the networks of social media. However,
        recognizing the embodied or internal experiences of social media is particularly
        challenging. Most social media and networks, on the surface, seem hyper-invested in creating
        overt visual displays or public performances, mediatized externalization as a means of
        communicating private, personal experience. One may consider, for example, the overt/covert
        use of visuality and internalization on YouTube. This online user-generated video platform
        supports predominantly visual media as a cover for circulating private experience. All
        manner of personal expression is rendered into video clip micro-documentaries and shared
        with a community of users, who may further circulate, comment, and edit it. Its
        communicative media power lies in the connective tissue built in the personal network of
        exchange that stem from <em class="term">produsing</em> private internal expression, not in the
        externalized aesthetics of the videos (which are often low budget and low quality). In other
        such social networks (Facebook, Daily Booth), personal and public spaces converge, rendering
        the "me," or the embodied (interiorized, organic) subject within
        media production, subverted. In this analysis, I track a historical context for considering
        the relationship between organic bodies and digital intervention and illustrate ways in
        which the human body currently operates as an expressive referent within social media
        networks. Drawing particularly on examples from YouTube, a social media network overtly
        dependant on visual content, I demonstrate that internal expression and pre-subject,
        pre-aesthetic organic value, is central in much current user-generated <span class="hi underlined">me</span>-dia. The pre-aesthetic impulse is one that I identify as a primal desire towards
        creative production and display. Deeply connected to one’s sense of embodied being-ness and
        need to express, it is, nevertheless, outside a model of aesthetic production bound to
        traditional representative models for artistic creation — to photography, painting, cinema,
        theatre, and literature, for example. Social <span class="hi underlined">me</span>-dia, I argue,
        operate and circulate with a deep connectedness to experience-production. That is after all
        its trademark, a proliferation of personal artifacts, radically increasing with each new
        iterative media type, or spontaneous desire to self-promote or to share. And yet its
        connection to the subject and site of production, the "me," is
        one which depends on a configuration of the material body where organic (vs. technical)
        material is a primary element of creation. The body of social <span class="hi underlined">me</span>-dia, as such, is not overwritten by the technical apparatus that seemingly mediates
        it. Mark B.N. Hansen, particularly in his work <cite class="title italic">Bodies in Code:
          Interfaces with Digital Media</cite>, offers the most radical, yet direct course to
        discover (recover) organic bodies and to resist such external and technically dominant
        models. Furthermore, he offers an intriguing perspective from which to explore the inherent
        organicism in contemporary social media practice and forms, particularly those that appear
        overtly ocularcentric, or visually-dependent and which are tied to aesthetic expression. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">As we move into the embodied spaces of social media, where the call to "Broadcast Yourself" is fully embraced by a next wave of user-generating
        content-subjects, one may ask, what is the content of such subjects, and how do they
          <em class="emph">matter</em> in the new media ecologies that spa(w)n them? New hybrid virtual and
        physical inscription spaces, social media spaces, I argue, have become more than surfaces
        for writing reality and are now complex mediated life worlds where inscription is no longer
        a metaphoric practice but an act of (pre-)self/real-world environmental coupling, inadequate
        to be viewed from the perspective of discursive representation. Hansen’s models for
        recognizing the relationships between real and virtual bodies and worlds, and for revealing
        the underlying tactile and motile forces that resist abstract formulation, offer a
        provocative in-road to these new hybrid <em class="emph">spaces</em> of production. Furthermore,
        Hansen’s insistence on promoting the primacy of the body as an agent in technical ordering,
        on revealing "the constitutive or ontological role of the body in giving
          birth to the world" enables a critical perspective that foregrounds the
        functionalist perspective of much social media <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. As forms
        of functional documentation, as opposed to representational media practice, many social
        media artifacts resist the drives of traditional media that operate with clear aesthetic
        goals and values and with a conscious intent to produce formal and professional media
        objects.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">As contemporary texts and representational contexts have become increasingly complex,
        semiotic surfaces and the inscription spaces which "contain" them
        have challenged theorists and media practitioners to identify, access, and engage the full
        spectrum of material surfaces which proliferate. Historically, embodiment and the varied
        forms of its discontents have been a profound focal point for critical reflection within
        digital media studies. This is particularly true within the late 1980’s to mid 1990’s wave
        of hypertext and then cyberstudies theorists. Arguably it is, in fact, <em class="emph">the</em>
        center-point for such critique. Responding to the "new" paradigms afforded by
        technology-assisted writing practices — Storyspace texts and environments, for example,
        followed closely by the creation of Internet-based cyberspace production — the webbed and
        malleable properties of hypertext, intrigued and stimulated a rich and fundamental
        first-wave of material-based critical reflection exploring new frontiers. Shelley Jackson’s
          <cite class="title italic">Patchwork Girl</cite> (1995), a re-telling of Mary Shelley’s <cite class="title italic">Frankenstein</cite> through the foregrounding of the female monster and her
        monstrous body, is an early and overt example of how the metaphorical material of text and
        body may be interlinked through digital media. The creative potential of fragmented
        text-bodies and the ironic potentialities of the stitched-together body-text (the
        hyperlinked text) revealed the power of the scar, the space between body parts, to express
        deeply embodied creativity through otherness and other voices. And yet this embodiment was
        driven by a politics of difference, or deformation from the norm to probe and critique
        normative value. Liberation was attained through an acceptance of self as other, organicism
        as abject power, text as broken (until re-worked).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The shift from page to screen within digital media has been well-documented: Bolter, Lanham
        and Landow, for example, explored in depth the liberating and fluid properties of
        hyper-linked electronic texts, defined by the immaterial semantics and semiotics of digital
        inscription texts and technology. Shifts in authorial agency, the material reconstruction of
        reading-practice, and the revolutionary ideological identity reconstructions, unrestricted
        by organic genealogy-parables and enabled by the new digital and cyberspaces were and are
        foundational critical perspectives for considering (dis)embodiment. In <cite class="title italic">Writing Space: The Computer, Hypertext, and the History of Writing</cite>, Bolter
        asserted the fixed nature of print text and identified hypertext production as a practice
        for "liberating the text" in digital space [<a class="ref" href="#bolter1991">Bolter 1991</a>, 21]. Lanham explored the political implications of
        computer-mediated texts and found the interactivity of digital text as a basis from which to
        overcome the fixed authority of the literary canon and to establish a new electronic
        democracy [<a class="ref" href="#lanham1993">Lanham 1993</a>, 31]. Landow unequivocally proclaimed in his
        analysis of the future of the book in the context of computer intervention that digital
        textuality, in comparison to print, was now "virtual, not
          physical"[<a class="ref" href="#landow1992">Landow 1992</a>, 216]. In his second edition of <cite class="title italic">Writing
          Space</cite> in 2001 (re-subtitled <cite class="title italic">Computers, Hypertext, and the
          Remediation of Print</cite>), Bolter surveys the theoretical field for electronic writing
        in relation to the increasing influence of the Internet. He isolates debates about the
        materiality of digital media as central to understanding the changes brought about for
        inscription in the digital age, "the late age of print" [<a class="ref" href="#bolter2001">Bolter 2001</a>, 1]. For Bolter debates about the unity (or not) of the Cartesian ego in the digital age
        and continuing reflections on mind-body paradigms struggle to situate media production. The
        impulse to explore singular vs. multiple authorship signals a revolution in material culture
        imagined through the communal matrix of network culture. Bolter acknowledges an irony in the
        claim that digitally produced texts inspire theorists to associate virtual production with
        materiality: "Our culture in the late age of print seems inclined to accept the

            networked communication " [<a class="ref" href="#bolter2001">Bolter 2001</a>, 202]. As is with many of the hypertext and early cyber-age theorists, such materiality,
        however, is clearly not associated with any pure physicality or organic singularity. It is
        associated with postmodern signification or mediated representation within the distributed
        network culture of electronic "affiliation and community" [<a class="ref" href="#bolter2001">Bolter 2001</a>, 203]. One’s private media productions are always subservient to a more public value
        associated with an aesthetics of representation driven by shared consumption. For Bolter,
        electronic media are produced when "the private and the public, the inner self and the outer persona, are
            so closely connected [that] the writer is never isolated from the material and cultural
            matrix of her networked culture" [<a class="ref" href="#bolter2001">Bolter 2001</a>, 202]. The singular body is literally overwritten by the mass mediations of the network and

        formed the definitive (im)material of new media were inevitable, and counter-debates quickly
        developed. Espen Aarseth’s ergodic taxonomies, outlined in detail within <cite class="title italic">Cybertext</cite>, for example, argue for historical links to digital
        innovation — to the codex model, for example — that defy multi-directional paths as unique
        to digital models. As multimodal texts progressed in their material innovation through the
        end of the millennium, they moved beyond linking functions to more complex formal
        constructions and network structures; they comprised recombinatory database structures
        working in tandem with hypertexts, for example, and the ability to identify <em class="emph">organic
          agency</em> from, or within, <em class="emph">technical functioning</em> was further challenged.
        The process of reading itself as a critical practice, disrupted and revealed by digital
        interventions, became central to the rhetorics of a developing new media "poetics," and in works such as Brian Kim Stefans’ "the dreamlife of letters" (1999), Stephanie Strickland’s <cite class="title italic">Vniverse</cite> (2002), Ana Maria Uribe’s <cite class="title italic">Anipoems</cite> (2003), language, its transformation in the reading-mind, and the spaces
        occupied by the digital reader-writer are all explored. Audio, image, text, and video
        components converged to form richly material surfaces and genre conventions also merged:
        cinematic models for Quicktime movies embedded on web pages and graphic design principles
        utilized within literary and linguistic conventions freely comingled, and such miscegenation
        proffered hybrid artifacts. Media production via futurist mutant manifesto reigned. Ludology
        gamed the narrative system, and stories became playable, programmable, and code-worthy;
        users and interactors <em class="emph">participated</em> in media, and reading became an applied
        critical practice, an integrated part of discursive representation. Jim Andrews in his
        poem-game <cite class="title italic">Arteroids 2.5</cite> (2003) deftly mixes metaphors, genres,
        and media as well as visual, kinetic, and audio signifiers to display language as a
        representational system to be played, and to be played with. Some theorists, like Janet
        Murray in <cite class="title italic">Hamlet on the Holodeck</cite> (1997), find a comfortable
        allegiance between tradition and invention, between stories and games, and unite them with
        new genre titles, with <em class="term">cyberdrama</em>, for example. Others, like Nick Montfort in
          <cite class="title italic">Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction</cite>,
        suggest a more complex basis for identifying creative co-mingling and its offspring. For
        Montfort, the core components of developing hybrid genres unite simulated <em class="term">world
          models</em> that are run through a computerized <em class="term">parser</em> to create
        interactive fictions [<a class="ref" href="#montfort2005">Montfort 2005</a>, viii]. Riddles are the base form for
        interaction in the new genre, and they lead players into a plenitude of puzzling metaphor,
        simulation, and abstraction. The riddle leads one away from internal bodily experience and
        into new digital thought-experiments, mind-games ruled by "recategorization and transformation — both of the external world, and the world of our
          consciousness" — far from organics [<a class="ref" href="#montfort2005">Montfort 2005</a>, 60]. Computer
        code and its relationship to language, machine language and human discourse hybrids also
        came under scrutiny and were seen as crucial to understanding digital aesthetics and
        signification as linked to programming. John Cayley, digital poet and theorist, recognizes
        digital textuality as based on a procedural "phenomenology of
          language," leading one not to real "things" but to
          "processes"[<a class="ref" href="#cayley2006">Cayley 2006</a>, 309]. In the early 21st century, theoretical reflections on
        experimental creole languages, code-talk, unnaturally shifted the figure and ground elements
        of behind-the-scenes programming and on-the-screen texts. For Rita Raley, this meant that
        programming operations lead away from organic self-realization toward an ontology of the
        technical device: "Broadly, codework, makes exterior the interior working of the
            computer" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#raley2002">#raley2002</a></span>. The notion of embodiment was complicated in the extra-inscribed surfaces and the

        user-bodies, architectural-bodies, avatar-bodies, reading-bodies, and writing-bodies
        overlap, recombine, devolve, and bewilder. Clearly the media ecology of the digital domain
        has become a fertile breeding ground for new life-forms, and developing a measuring stick
        for pure organicism vs. embodied representation is an overt critical challenge. As such, it
        is embraced by an increasingly interdisciplinary set of theorists who approach embodiment
        from a wide array of perspectives. Eugene Thacker in <cite class="title italic">Biomedia</cite>
        is representative of a movement to recapture organic bodies through a theoretical melding of
        molecular biology’s "wet lab" techniques and those of
        computational bioinformatics, or "dry lab" considerations [<a class="ref" href="#thacker2004">Thacker 2004</a>, 2]. Thacker presents a context for recognizing a deeply
        intertwined duality of virtual and physical bodies: "The biological and the digital domains are no longer rendered
            ontologically distinct, but instead are said to inhere in each other; the biological
              'informs' the digital, just as the digital
              'corporealizes' the biological" [<a class="ref" href="#thacker2004">Thacker 2004</a>, 7]. Thus, although Thacker seemingly moves toward a more scientific method to situate
          <em class="emph">real</em> bodies, outside the aesthetics of pure representation and towards more
        scientific renderings, his approach is ultimately discursive. Biomedia bodies are not
        machine/human hybrids, or transcendental markers of erasure, and their mixed ontology
        (biological and digital) means the singular body is not expressed in the genetic/computer
        code hybrid. One does not ask, then, what a body is, but rather "what a body can do?" [<a class="ref" href="#thacker2004">Thacker 2004</a>, 6]. That is, one asks what a body becomes when viewed through its discursively rendered
        behaviors, a step removed from its essential nature.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Since Hayles first identified the struggle to recover the Cartesian body lost to
          "information" in <cite class="title italic">How We Became Posthuman</cite>,
        she has also remained in an iterative critical loop focused on material embodiment in
        digital contexts. In texts such as <cite class="title italic">Writing Machines</cite>, she enacts
        the recursive impulse to reassert material metaphors as the basis for human-machine
        signifying practice. For Hayles, the material metaphor is the eternally changing
        red-yellow-green signal regulating the semiotic flow between signifiers and texts, the
          "traffic between words and physical artifacts," a
          <em class="term">technotext</em> control-measure for inscription, where the technically-rendered
        text is exposed through a foregrounding of its machinery — a distinctly un-organic
        enterprise [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2002">Hayles 2002</a>, 22]. For Hayles, the <em class="term">writing
          machines</em> she imagines, and the (machine-like) materiality they foreground as
        essential components of their inscription practices, embody meaning primarily at a level of
        discursive signification, or at "the imaginative realm of verbal/semiotic signifiers" [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2002">Hayles 2002</a>, 25]. The organic body, per se, is only revealed as a component <em class="emph">within</em>
        systems of representation; it is "an emergent property" and one
        that arrives as a result of interactions "between physical properties
          and a work’s artistic strategies"[<a class="ref" href="#hayles2002">Hayles 2002</a>, 33]. Materiality <em class="emph">is</em> mobilized, and it clearly
        mediates: it literally exists in a middle ground between the world of things and the world
        of ideas, "in between the richness of a physically robust world and human
            intelligence as it crafts this physicality to create meaning" [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2002">Hayles 2002</a>, 33]. Materiality is, thus, coextensive with meaning, with signification, or
        representation. Abstraction, as such, is not fully evident, and liminal bodies, sites of
        ambiguous non-identification, resolve into consciously registered aesthetic
        production-machines. The machine-body of the text encodes meanings and is itself encoded in
        a semiotic assembly-line where physicality is represented through a body’s strategic
        artistic properties. However, this material formulation does not account for media
        production outside of aesthetic valuation. The "metaphor" itself implies
        resolution, equivalency, x = y. But what of the work-production that engages bodies,
        mobilizes expressions, exudes tactility, and yet resists the politics of pure aesthetic
        production? The metaphors at the heart of Hayles’ material reflections allow little room for
        slippage in terms of intentionality for finding physicality or pure organic expression
        within production. As the physical properties of a work, the embodied content and the
        container, can only be seen within iterative discourse loops, the irresolute excesses remain

        the embodied aesthetics at work within social media artifacts that do not always seem
        motivated to produce meaning, or substantive matter even, within the generative politics of
        discourse and artistic semiotics. When one considers, for example, what Patricia Lange calls

        evident in many YouTube videos, one can recognize that traditional cinema art-house
        aesthetics do not apply [<a class="ref" href="#lange2009">Lange 2009</a>, 74]. Popular YouTube subjects range
        from the more familiar video-fare recognizable in home-movies and videos: birthday parties,

        documentations now publicly circulated: belly-fat jiggling, Lego-building, baby
        lemon-sucking, and bedroom web-cam dancing. Hansen’s reflections on embodiment within

        that currently there is a "fading of the hype surrounding virtual

        technologies, has created a rich dimension of experience where virtual being is not discrete
        from reality. Citing media artists and researchers Monika Fleischmann and Wolfgang Strauss,
        he defines the new realm of virtuality: <blockquote><p>Central in this reimagining of VR as a mixed reality stage is a
            certain specification of the virtual. No longer a wholly distinct if largely amorphous
            realm with rules all its own, the virtual now denotes a "space full
              of information" that can be "activated, revealed,
              reorganized and recombined, added to and transformed as the user navigates…real
              space." <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span></p></blockquote> Hansen proposes that in the realm of contemporary media culture, where one
        continually negotiates between the saturated information spaces of RL and VL, "all reality is mixed reality," and the relationship between natural
        and virtual worlds is deeply rooted in understanding the role of embodiment in both <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. However, Hansen argues that the <em class="term">mixed reality
          paradigm</em> — the fundamental model through which he asserts that all current embodied
        experience is shaped in seamless, fluid transitions between real and virtual media spaces —
        foregrounds the "primacy of the body as ontological access to the
          world"; the body offers a "functionalist perspective"
        where the "role of the tactility in the actualization of that
          access" belies traditional constructivist paradigms focused on representation of
        bodies only within discourse <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. Mixed realities assert
        physicality and bodily motility, emphasizing not only what a body can do, but how it
        operates in physical motion, rather than in mental abstraction. (One may consider then those
        belly fat jiggle and Lego construction ephemera videos in this context, for example.) This
        model moves away, then, from a critical perspective dependant on deforming, disrupting, or
        foregrounding representative discourse by reasserting <em class="emph">new</em> digitized versions
        with which one may interact (as with works like Strickland’s <cite class="title italic">Vniverse</cite>, Andrews’ <cite class="title italic">Arteroids 2.5</cite>, or Jackson’s
          <cite class="title italic">Patchwork Girl</cite>). Although earlier digital works such as these
        consider the body as an integral mediator, they also ultimately mix realities only in the
        realm of the mind (or the intellectual sphere) and on the screen, and are highly dependent
        on knowledge of previous aesthetic and creative systems, of sonnet forms, novels, or games.
        For Hansen, "embodied human agency" is a perspective for "perceptuomotor activity," a site of heightened perceptive and
        physicalized action, where tactility and biological functioning are not merely referenced
        within iterative discursive leaps, or mediated with an end-goal of intellectual
        understanding <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. Instead the biological body, the organic
        body, overshadows and overpowers critical attempts to place it inside signification and make
        it a mere surface for representation. As a force of tactile activity, the body shapes
        experience to conform to its organizing schema and offers phenomenological evidence that it
        is a "primordial and active source of resistance" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. Specifically, it resists representative models, including creative and aesthetic
        ones, that refine meaning only in discursive models, those that come <em class="emph">after</em> the
        body has been <em class="emph">overcome</em> by the mind, or ones materializing after the visual
        sense has emerged secondarily from the body sense. (Lacanian philosophy, for example,
        depends on the primacy of the mirror stage, when the subject sees herself in reflection, as
        a key movement into language, into culture.) However, alternately one may view contemporary
        media from the site of the organic body, as a <em class="emph">body in code</em>, a neither purely
        informational body, nor a disembodied reflection of "the everyday body " <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. It is anti-representational and is a body "submitted to and
          constituted by an unavoidable and empowering technical deterritorialization,"
        emerging only "in conjunction with technics", with a theoretical
        perspective on the <em class="term">originary technicity of the human</em><span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. For Hansen, technicity — the body’s relation to
        exteriority, to something outside of itself, and its mediation of that awareness — is key to
        understanding the significance of embodiment to aesthetic production. His reflections on the
        phenomenal body (not surprisingly extended from the work of Merleau-Ponty) allow a critical
        perspective where the operational mechanisms of the body (vs. the representational ones)
        seem suited to the varied practices and emerging forms evident in social media arenas. The
        phenomenal body is connected to the body schema (body map) as opposed to the body image (a
        specular construct), and it is an active agent filled with sensory data and not overly
        dependent on organized intellectual data or visual cues (Hansen 2006, 38–43). I assert that
        such bodily and tactile motility, recognized as agents of embodied production, offer
        critical models to account for the deep organism-environment coupling (for Hansen, the
        technical mediation of the <em class="term">body schema</em>) one finds in the active embodied
        productions of social media where personal-public displays of <em class="emph">affect</em>ion
        dominate. <em class="term">The body of affect</em>, a state of "one’s incongruity
          with oneself" where fixed identity is overcome through singular "excess" serves as a rich model to consider the fluid networked me/not
        me in social <span class="hi underlined">me</span>-dia <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>.
        Affect, characterized by emotional and sensory connections felt in the body and expressed
        through it, with it, is a defining feature of social media’s mode of anti-intellectual,
        experience-based production.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">One may again consider, in this context, Twitter as an illustration of a mixed reality and

        forms. It operates on computers or handheld devices (the technical device is irrelevant),

        documenting and mediating one’s own interests and experience, as well as a site to
        disseminate the experiences and interests of others. Tweets de-personalize <em class="emph">my

        with <em class="emph">my followers</em>; they are driven forward through recursive re-tweeting and

          <em class="emph">you</em>, in an anti-personal account of personal and collaborative experiential
        location, no matter how trivial: "I am at the grocery store buying milk (and you are with
          me via my twitter-feed.)" Twitter’s dependence on the circulation of
          <em class="emph">affect</em>, rather than the production or mediation of aesthetic meaning, is in
        fact central to its operation, although it may also be a container for more direct
        information: to advertise goods and services and to announce events. As a platform for
        circulation, rather than a pure medium, it can sustain multiple operations and serve a
        variety of purposes, as the conveyor of personal information or as an advertising forum. It
        operates similarly to what Pelle Snickars and Patrick Vonderau have identified as the
        ambiguous power and economic flexibility of the YouTube platform; "The

        Diane Gromala in <cite class="title italic">Windows and Mirrors: Interaction Design, Digital Art,
          and the Myth of Transparency</cite>. In this text, Bolter and Gromala use digital art
        within the SIGGRAPH 2000 exhibition to exemplify radical new interfaces that engage the user
        in their production practice. Hansen too finds rich source material in digital art and
        practice. Like Bolter and Gromala, he dedicates much of his theoretical examples to
        exploring the operative interfaces of digital art, but ultimately moves into other virtual
        domains (architectural space, wearable space, narrative literary space, and Internet
        cyberspace, stopping short of social media). However Hansen’s conclusions differ
        significantly from Bolter and Gromala’s. They argue that digital artifacts oscillate between

        Digital artifacts naturalize representations and reflect and foreground mediated, yet
        personal and embodied, experiences for those who encounter them. The interfaces they

          <em class="emph">participate</em> in their creative production <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bolterandgromala2003">#bolterandgromala2003</a></span>. Like Hayles’ middle approach, embodiment is iterative. However, Hansen’s
        critical departure resists any kind of mutually dependent or recursive configuration and
        warrants further exploration and application as to the primacy of embodiment in social
        media.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">To facilitate a discussion of the viability of Hansen’s position in regards to social media
        practice, I provide a summary of the four primary elements which Hansen outlines to
        illustrate the function of digital technologies and "the sensory
          commons," the <em class="term">me/not me</em> space, they afford in contemporary media
        culture <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. According to Hansen, digital technologies: 1)
        expand the scope of bodily (motor) activity; 2) broaden the domain of the
          <em class="term">prepersonal</em>; 3) create an anonymous medium for co-belonging (a
          <em class="emph">being-with</em>-ness); 4) transform collective existence from self-enclosed
        cognitive functioning to open forms of communal motor-driven, motile participation to assert
        the "ongoing technogenesis of the human" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. Such a state of technogenesis (of continual creation, of beginning again) is
        characterized by a body’s relation to exteriority, to that outside of or in excess to, its
        core sense of embodied being. This state of other-awareness is not dependant on visual
        recognition or overt cognitive functions to produce. Therefore artistic production, as such,
        may be recognized as an embodied impulse within which to express one’s own state of
        being-ness and to connect to the exterior world, indicating a relationship to communal
        relations, but separated from representative politics and objective consciousness. ("I do
        not need <em class="emph">you</em> to <span class="hi underlined">see</span><em class="emph">me</em> produce an artifact outside of <em class="emph">my</em> self.") One may, then,
        express aesthetics, without fully extending an awareness of otherness as something outside
        one’s own primal experience. Extending these elements within social media offers a dynamics
        of expressive embodiment illustrating the ways that the body itself operates as a core agent
        of production and as a formal organizing aesthetic within the social medias and practices
        that dominate contemporary culture. Users of Facebook, for example, are not unfamiliar with
        the status update from the "friend" who overshares, or who offers
          "too-much-information," seemingly unaware of the public forum on which
        she or he posts, or who indulges in hyper-trivial, mundane, or too-personal updates
        uncharacteristic of public declaration: "I bought toilet paper today." One may also
        consider YouTube as an exemplary model for many other social media. Driven as it is by
        user-generated production means, it invites user-producers to participate in artifact making
        based on personal experience, but for the purpose of forming a collective network. The state
        of co-belonging supersedes individuation, as evidenced by tagging, commenting, reply, and
        rating functions, for example. Motile tactility is referenced in the hyperconscious
        referencing of self-mediation in the <em class="term">prepersonal</em> domain, where pure
        subject-object difference is viewed under erasure and the <em class="term">power of imaging</em> via
        technical means is a form of internal surveillance and an enactment of primal technics. The
        talking-head vlog post, now iconic in structure with its web-cam framing and domestic
        setting reference point, is a straw-man set-up for <em class="emph">my</em> experience, a generic
        device posing as subjective function. One can consider, for example, the definitive features
        of the well-known lonelygirl15 vlog posts. This series of posts made in 2006, although
        eventually (and ironically) exposed as a hoax and part of a professional film-making
        experiment, epitomize the private and confessional aesthetics of typical vloggers. Set in a
        bedroom, and focused on the emotional and impassioned outpourings of a teenage girl at war
        with her parents, they strive to defy the slick aesthetics of professional video-making
        techniques and operate at the level of hyper-privacy and social mediation. Even though
        falsely contrived, they circulated and affirmed a model for YouTube vlogging and
        pre-aesthetic rendering. They were straight-to-camera, from-my-bedroom, spontaneous
        diary-like musings, combined with a presumed social connection to an ideal someone (in this
        case to fake-vlogger Daniel, playing the love interest role). This ideal audience is always
        imagined to be somewhere out there, listening to or for <em class="emph">me</em>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Lonelygirl15, with the head-shot framing and the personal confessions within private
        locations, epitomizes what Lange calls <em class="term">videos of affinity</em>. These videos
        foreground the creation of sensory impressions and spontaneous creativity using private and
        intimate communication techniques (like eating on camera) and moving, adjusting, or shaking
        the camera (to evade transparent media representation). They don’t operate merely to
        showcase the vlogger, but to bring her into contact with "potential others who identify and interpellate themselves as intended
            viewers of the video" [<a class="ref" href="#lange2009">Lange 2009</a>, 71]. This was clear in the construction of lonelygirl15, for example, with the inclusion
        of Daniel. The producers recognized that the power of lonelygirl15’s vlog posts were not in
        a representation of the vlogger alone, but in her eventual communication with another via
        the internal "monologue" she used to surveille and promote her private
        state of being. In this sense, <span class="hi underlined">lonely</span>girl15 was merely a front
        for an idealized aesthetics of affinity embraced by most vloggers, and she was never really
        lonely, as long as she was engaged by the social media network. The presumed interaction of
        vlogging is inevitable and displays of <em class="emph">affect</em> in social media networks
        eventually lead to bodies of <em class="emph">affection</em>. For Lange, affinity videos on YouTube
        operate as a form of "habeas corpus," bringing the body firmly
        into view to forge intimate connections with others [<a class="ref" href="#lange2009">Lange 2009</a>, 78].
        This body of affinity, like Hansen’s body-in-code, shapes the experiences it relays and
        deepens the mediations between pre-subject and presumed other, without exteriorizing
        production at a pure site of representation. Disconnected from aesthetic function, it serves
        as a marker of network affiliation and organic functioning within a reenactment of
        primordial technicity: this body performs an awareness of otherness, without separating it
        from the deeply personal felt within.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Offering a perspective to view organic and technical operations, many YouTube posts couple
        the pre-subject with digital technologies to display a primary or primal state of the
        body-in-code. In <cite class="title italic">YouTube: Online Video and Participatory
          Culture</cite>, Jean Burgess and Joshua Green reflect on the complicated structure of
        YouTube itself as an identifiable media form. They recognize the inability to reduce
        theoretical considerations of YouTube to a singular phenomenon. It currently operates both
        as a mainstream media outlet and as critique and counter-cultural model subverting those
        political and aesthetic models. Burgess and Green acknowledge it as a business, but also as
        a form of what David Weinberger has termed a "meta-business," one
        that serves as a distribution platform to enhance the value of content developed elsewhere
        and draw attention to it [<a class="ref" href="#burgessandgreen2009">Burgess and Green 2009</a>, 4]. In this sense, it
        does not assume the pure aesthetics and production qualities of other mainstream media that
        clearly foreground their own creations, rendering them artistic for (and before) public
        consumption. Similar to the claim Lange makes that homemade, anti-aesthetic ephemera
        dominate YouTube media content, Burgess and Green suggest that "vernacular creativity," that is, a wide range of creative practices, from
        scrapbooking to informal story-telling in conversational chat, is at work in many YouTube
        expressions. Amateur content-makers according to this model are more inclined to personal
        expressions "outside the cultural value systems of either high culture
          or commercial creative practice" and as a method to enforce social networking.
        Operating, as a body-in-code, they express an affiliation with technics, with a primal
        desire to express a relationship to exteriority and to specular rendering, without erasing a
        form of primordial tactility inherent to pure embodied and private states-of-being. In this
        site of co-belonging, one desires to be <em class="emph">felt</em> (that is, as opposed to being
          <em class="emph">seen</em>) in order to instantiate a form of communal ontology and sharing, one
        that is organic, and one that is both mine and yours. Burgess and Green support this
        position when they claim that when considering YouTube "it is important
          not to fall into the trap of simply assuming that vernacular video is organized primarily
          around a desire to broadcast the self"; instead it operates to promote "social networking" over modes of traditional cultural production [<a class="ref" href="#burgessandgreen2009">Burgess and Green 2009</a>, 25–26].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Another popular YouTube genre is that of the homemade dance remix video. In fact, such
        videos characterize some of the earliest YouTube successes, marked by the number of hits
        (views by others) and by their circulation to achieve viral status via the social network.
        Unlike the movie theater or Broadway stage, there is no one space to find these expressions;
        you can come to them, or they may find you — via email inbox, twitter feed, or Facebook
        post. Burgess and Green cite the video dance version of the Pixies song <cite class="title italic">Hey</cite> (identified as the <cite class="title italic">Hey Clip</cite> on YouTube) as one
        of the most popular YouTube videos to date with more than 21 million views as of March 2008
          [<a class="ref" href="#burgessandgreen2009">Burgess and Green 2009</a>, 26]. Dance videos like the <cite class="title italic">Hey Clip</cite> are generally edited remakes of mainstream music, usually in a domestic
        setting, like a bedroom or living room. They illustrate the strong drive to foreground
        embodied experience and transmit communication codes outside of traditional signifying
        systems, and most often outside a professional aesthetics. The amateur nature of the videos,
        which often appear spontaneous and unrehearsed, or rehearsed to a degree, but never to
        expert level, is a key component of this genre. In the dance remixes, the dancing subjects
        seem to be enacting a private (and somewhat universal) experience of embodied musical
        pleasure and fantasy reenactment: "I want to express how the music makes me feel and
          materializes in my body-moves"<em class="emph">and</em>"I want to learn to dance like Shakira and embody her presence in me." Although prior
        to social media outlets, these dances may have happened in private, now they operate at
        another level of private and conjoined expression. Peters and Seier in "Home Dance: Mediacy and Aesthetics of the Self on YouTube" acknowledge the mixed
        messages of YouTube dance videos that proffer a "specific ambivalence of
          self — control and forgetting, discipline and pleasure." Here the bedroom mirror is
        replaced by a YouTube audience, and I am alone, yet joined to you [<a class="ref" href="#petersandseier2004">Peters and Seier 2004</a>, 199]. Peters and Seier describe the popular bedroom
        site as one like Foucault’s heterotopia: "equally private and public, actually existing and utopian,
            performative and transgressive" [<a class="ref" href="#petersandseier2004">Peters and Seier 2004</a>, 199]. This site, like the mixed reality sensory commons that envelops Hansen’s
        body-in-code correlate, is one where "motor activity — not
          representational verisimilitude" express the core organic agent at the heart of
        convergent digital culture <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. The motility of the body,
        dancing on camera with an imagined audience and equalized by the interior pleasure of just
          <em class="emph">moving to the music</em>, is evident in these YouTube videos. Beyoncé’s popular
        song "Single Ladies" has been remixed thousands of times on
        YouTube and performed by everyone from babies to grandfathers, dancing with wild abandon and
        with varying degrees of allegiance to the actual choreography. The original video, with its
        minimal sets, engaging choreographed moves, and impossible to forget tune, was itself
        seemingly created with an eye toward reproduction. It was made to be remade, and it
        represents a shift in production politics where the ambivalence of ownership gives way to a
        performance of functional expression. Watch me (or "Feel" me), watch ("feel") my
        body watching ("feeling") Beyoncé’s body, and I will watch ("feel") you, etc….</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">One may recognize how all of these examples defy generic identity politics and operate at a
        revolutionary level to recover organic presence from transcendental cyberculture. Like the
        homey bedroom <em class="emph">sets</em> glimpsed behind the webcam-framed vlogger, bodies slyly
        materialize both as the backdrop for creative and critical mediated self-expression and as
        dynamic pre-personal text-subjects asserting a pre-aesthetic drive to mediate outside
        traditional spaces of representation. These contemporary forms resist the disembodied
        abstraction promised by early-generation cyber-theorists and traditional poststructuralist
        perspectives. They assert a primordial drive to overcome ocularcentric dynamics, that
        threaten to subvert the phenomenal body to the visually constructed one. They clearly put
        expressive bodies before external signification and challenge new <span class="hi underlined">me</span>-dia politics grounded in the production aesthetics of tactile motility and
          <em class="emph">amateur</em> organics.</div></div><div id="worksCited"><h2>Works Cited</h2><div class="bibl fallback"><span class="ref" id="aarseth1997"><!-- close -->Aarseth 1997</span> Aarseth, Espen. <cite class="title italic">Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature</cite>.
