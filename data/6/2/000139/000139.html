Narrative in the <cite class="title italic">Dynamo!</cite> is not entirely absent, but its dominance is put into question. The same holds for the place of argumentation in critical writing. The <cite class="title italic">Dynamo!</cite> develops episodically, haunted by the comics, and by the popular and literary narratives it samples; the essay develops similarly, in blocks of partly autobiographical, partly analytical text. Propositions emerge not sequentially or through feats of interpretation, but at the moment when a block of text encounters a cited image from the <cite class="title italic">Dynamo!</cite></p><p>Another collocation having implications for criticism, is the reading of Armstrong/Tippett's work in the context of a particular strain of contemporary fiction in print, which itself demonstrates that narrative was only ever a mode, one among many and not necessarily the dominant mode, in print literature itself. References are made to Pynchon's <cite class="title italic">Gravity's Rainbow</cite>, to Pynchon's (and Armstrong/Tippett's) modernist antecedent, Henry Adams, to non-linear, non-sequential narratives by Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, and William Gaddis that are as open to innovation formally as they are expansive in subject matter. In this context, "Graphic Sublime" also introduces a major, as yet unpublished novel from the early 1970s by Phillip Wohlstetter, <cite class="title italic">Valparaiso</cite>. </p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">A Narrative Re-Shuffling</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In Gary Shteyngart's <cite class="title italic">Super Sad True Love Story</cite>, set in a near-future America that is financially reliant on China and Western Europe, the populace is "starkly divided between the proletariat and the bourgeois, obsessed with pendant-sized devices called <em class="term">äppäräti</em> that display a constantly updating biographical sketch of the holders vis-a-vis those around them"[<a class="ref" href="#shteyngart2001">Shteyngart 2001</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d30858e128">[1]</a> One character, finding himself dispossessed of devices, throws himself off the roof of his apartment building, so painful is the feeling of disconnection. More fortunate residents in the same building are the couple Lenny and Eunice, who put one another through a careful self-screening of characteristics, by no means matching but nonetheless necessary to their connection: "categories of net-worth, 'fuckability,' child-abuse scales, and other measures achingly important to Americans in Shteyngart's fictional world." (Ellis) </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2"><em class="emph">Narrative</em>, evidently, is the default setting for new media — as media present themselves to the imagination of current print realism. Novels concerned with happiness and sadness, truth, love, and, not least, <em class="emph">story</em>, have no trouble absorbing devices as though they were all part of our culture's ongoing sentimental education. The sad truth of this particular novel by Shteyngart might be stated as an allegory of what happens when narrative is personalized and its display is facilitated from one moment to the next, even as the narrated experience is under way. Biographical notations in new media, updated continually, need to be validated by being shared, over long distances and <em class="emph">in the present</em>. Users need to know, always, where they stand within self-organizing, self-interested systems of professional networking, dating, entertainment, travel, etc. The delay mechanisms in print (separating hand and eye, composition and later presentation on the published page to a relatively amorphous audience) can no longer be tolerated by a sensibility grown accustomed to a life arranged in media. A post is like a phrase spoken in conversation in that a response is needed for its completion. Dynamism, rather than reflection, is more the norm in new media.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The self-conscious migration of literature into new media has been a fevered reconstruction (and continuous presentation) of narrativity, by which I mean the need for constant connection and to make present (as an ongoing story) the events of one's life over time and across distances. The idea, a given for many scholars and most mainstream fiction writers today, that a life worth living must be lived narratively — that an experience worth sharing had best be told as a story — has been carried into new media but not, as we might have anticipated, through hypertexts and other kinds of born-digital literary writing. Nor can digitized novels, long poems, or continuous dramas have anything approaching the cultural presence of the kinds of narrative now associated with handheld devices and social networks.<a class="noteRef" href="#d30858e155">[2]</a> Even games in new media are said to need a narrative, to justify themselves as educational or fulfilling. (By contrast, nameless designers of the old board games never had to apologize for pleasures that were taken, for the most part, episodically and without narrative reconstruction, with the roll of a dice, the gain of a few millions in play cash, or the construction of a very long word over squares of varying value.)</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Could anyone have expected that this one literary element — narrativity — would have come to inhabit new media so thoroughly? That the social and the affective would re-assert itself with such a vengeance, in an environment grounded in what is calculable, useful, and instrumental? Most surprising of all is the way this self-assertion has been reinforced by media whose operations (based in calculations and high speed binary selection) in themselves could not be further from narrative. Even in the realist tradition in print, narrative was never so thoroughly realized, so firmly tied to characters whose desires could be measured from one moment to the next, given a value, and hence made available for <em class="emph">exchange</em>. What can be held in place, in the mind of a reader who might regard himself as a character in various ongoing fictions, can be reinforced, certainly, by devices held in the hand and suited to the interrogation of others — concerning their traits, their whereabouts (and ours) at any given time, our present availability for social, sexual, or work relations.<a class="noteRef" href="#d30858e171">[3]</a> Life-narratives no longer need to be displaced into the more reflective genres of novelistic fiction. And what's more: our narratives have become newly calculable, measurable from one moment to the next, and hence available for direct participation in an economy of "passionate interests" [<a class="ref" href="#latour2010">Latour 2010</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d30858e179">[4]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Does the present re-situation of our personal narratives from novels to apps imply a transformation of literary engagement generally? It might, if one holds that narrative is essential to literature — even as some claim (with very little objective justification) that narrative is essential to a well-lived life. But narrative, in fact, has been only one, arguably a minority, element in the long network of literary fiction in print<a class="noteRef" href="#d30858e188">[5]</a> – whose canonical texts more often demonstrate episodic, fragmentary, and situational aspects of knowledge (even within the realm of 19th century realism, but certainly in epical, allegorical, and a rich variety of modernist forms that tend to explore consciousness more than connection). Musil, Joyce, Proust, Pynchon, and Wallace are no less a part of the literary mainstream than Dickens and Austen. Similarly, our present äppäräti, however great their commercial market share, are only a small portion of what the current technological culture produces, in comparison with databases and supporting softwares. (Consider, for example, how little press coverage is given to the CEO of the German company that holds rights to the enabling software used in every Apple app.) The tendency to focus on that small portion of technology that falls under our individual narrative control is no more accurate or desirable, when it comes to technologies, than is the tendency to equate realism in fiction with a <em class="emph">narrative realism</em>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">A largely impersonal, non-narrative form also can have a place in new media, though not those media that come down to us in the form of <em class="emph">devices</em>. When one considers databases, codework, or any of the hundreds of streaming media that refresh the screen that we happen to have open at any given time — the possibilities for other kinds of meaning making become readily apparent. The literary re-opens, when demands for immediacy and for interaction are lowered. When freed from the need always to be responding instrumentally, readers and viewers can cultivate habits of reflection that might echo the experience of print reading but remain wholly within the possibilities and constraints of new media. Such are the literary qualities that I discovered during a period of several months in 2008, when I was asked to write on a digital art installation by Kate Armstrong and Michael Tippett. <cite class="title italic">Grafik Dynamo!</cite> is a networked cultural artifact that includes arbitrary associations between texts and images drawn from RSS feeds on the Web. The work is a sort of network comic book, which pulls together texts written by Armstrong with more or less random images pulled in from LiveJournal and Flicker. The work was observed, during that particular period, in much the way that I observe most works of born-digital writing — that is to say, in a state of semi-distraction and occasional reflection. I had the <cite class="title italic">Dynamo!</cite> running on one or two windows, behind or to the side of other windows that required more immediate attention. Those interfaces, apps, and emails at the front of my screen must exist, somewhere. I don't intend to return to these everyday communications, and I hope nobody else will have occasion to want to do so.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">For the present collection of <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> essays on new media writing, I return to the written record of my experience with the <cite class="title italic">Dynamo!</cite> The text that follows originally was included as a catalog essay put together by the Prairie Art Gallery, when the work was exhibited in Grande Prarie, Alberta. I was not able to attend the exhibition and I have not checked to see if the event was documented in new media, but that is not the experience I wish to present here. Rather, the essay offers a sense of how a range of literary qualities can exist, almost accidentally, within or around the instrumental, highly narrativized spaces of new media. Precisely because the work is so minimal — more a matter of framing than narrativizing — there is not so much in the way of stated authorial intention to divert our critical attention; with no need ever actively to <em class="emph">respond</em> to the images and text organized for us by "the device," a space emerges for unmolested viewing and reflective reading. There will be instances in what follows, where my own conceptual shifts might seem no less arbitrary than the image that happens to be pulled from the LiveJournal at any given moment, on any given screen. The just mentioned "device," which (according to one of the hundreds of text snippets) is "lost in the general flux of ideas," had no connection, in my earlier reading, with the devices in Shteyngart (whom I had not read at the time). Other, more visual connections (to Roy Lichtenstein's prints, for example), occurred to me too late, to be worked into the body of the written text. These connections emerged only on re-reading, and while looking again at the image clips I pulled from LiveJournal (which are not the same as the ones reproduced in the catalog, or the ones presented here, in this slightly revised version for <cite class="title italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</cite>).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">In this sense, the present essay is also a kind of autobiography, but one that is without the usual, strong narrative that so often attaches itself to new media, and without the strong argumentative thread that characterizes professional literary criticism. Here I am interested in what it means to inhabit the much more extensive environment of streaming images and streaming text, which does not in itself exhibit narrative qualities, which precludes argument, and which only accidentally can be said to have literary qualities. I am increasingly persuaded that electronic literature, if it should ever come to be a widely recognized practice, will emerge not because artists self-consciously interrogate the aesthetic or literary affordances of this or that specific technology.<a class="noteRef" href="#d30858e230">[6]</a> Rather, literature is poised to enter our mediated lives in much the way that literature has always done — at those moments when we cease to involve ourselves too fully or immediately in what can be reported, and we engage not exclusively with characters who can be known and stories that can be told but rather with modes of consciousness and cognition.<a class="noteRef" href="#d30858e236">[7]</a> These latter are capable constantly of being refreshed, and revised, generating "patterns of reading that come to be interspersed with regular life" (in Armstrong's words) [<a class="ref" href="#armstrong2008">Armstrong 2008</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">The essay that follows is a record of the reflections occasioned by one reader, in the hope that others will bring their own conceptual frames and schema to bear on the work (that remains in place at its <cite class="title italic">turbulence.org</cite> site and hence is available for further reflection and evaluation).</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Graphic Sublime: On the Art and Designwriting of Kate Armstrong and Michael Tippett</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">We still like to think of it as "out there": the Web, the World-System. We've had it long enough for a generation of children to reach adulthood using computers, and for a generation of new media artists to build bodies of work. No longer are we looking at literary migrations; hybrids are capable now of being born digital, not carried over from Fprint, punch card, or canvas to the screen. We go there, to the terminal, to look things up, to book our vacations, to network, to post resumes, to find the jobs that keep us sitting, for the most part, in front of terminals. Or it comes to us – on a mobile, handheld, cell, or pod. "How old world" it seems, to Kate Armstrong and her generation of literary and graphic artists, how labor intensive and exploratory, to go in "search" of information when it can be brought to us through an RSS feed: a Rich Site Summary, RDF Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication. <blockquote><div class="ptext">Visit the website? How old world. Why would you, when it – when they – can come to you?

Thereafter, Wohlstetter's account of the coup continues as conventional reportage, or rather, a report of a halting record-in-progress: <blockquote><p>"I am standing here in Santiago, Chile, a corner across from La Moneda palace," says a man in tweeds, "the office of President Salvador Allende." He is talking into a cassette recorder. I didn't notice his arrival. "I'm looking at the smoke and flames — " Click. "Damn," he says. He flips the cassette to the blank side.

For a richly diverse, extended period in North American literary history, it seemed that the novel could still register political changes by noting down the expressive changes in contemporary languages, not least the professional languages that were evolving along with a technological society.  An account of the whaling industry in <cite class="title italic">Moby Dick</cite>, the development of the German-American "Rocket State" in <cite class="title italic">Gravity's Rainbow</cite>, and the establishment of a neo-liberal autocracy in <cite class="title italic">Valparaiso</cite>, could each fill in for the emergence of an entire world-system. The quest for domination, by Ahab, by Blicero, by Robert Coover's comedian character, Richard Nixon, might have been strange accounts of a single, overreaching personality.

Once a world-system takes hold in reality (as in Pinochet's Chile), its representation in literature largely ceases. If the short-lived socialist state under Salvator Allende was unique, conforming neither to Marxist nor Maoist precepts, the counter-revolution and authoritarian capitalism that followed would become all too familiar. Although outright military force was usually avoided, the innovations of the U.S. backed Pinochet government were to be picked up and further developed by the Thatcher, Deng, Reagan, Yeltsin administrations and their successors.  The revolutionary impulses of the Sixties and early Seventies, it was discovered, could be reigned in not through military force alone, but with a more ambitious, more subtle, and long-term expansion of the military into the social and the economic spheres (even as the military itself would be reconstructed on a corporate model: soldiers to be replaced, largely, by security forces, military engagements overseas decided in days or weeks, from the air, and other innovations described by the Mexican philosopher and sociologist, Manuel DeLanda, in <cite class="title italic">War in the Age of Intelligent Machines</cite>).</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000139/resources/images/image11.jpeg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000139/resources/images/image11.jpeg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 11. </div>THE COCKTAIL PARTY WENT ON, OBLIVIOUS TO THE MONUMENTAL ATMOSPHERIC CHANGE.

"The generation of '73," Wohlstetter's generation, the generation of Robert Coover, Don DeLillo, William Gaddis, and Thomas Pynchon, produced narratives that were as open to innovation, formally, as they sought to be expansive in subject matter. The embrace, by these writers, of comic forms can be seen in retrospect to have been more scandalous than the obscenities and broken sexual taboos, a generation or two earlier, in the work of James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Anais Nin. This latest, arguably the last, generation of world-epical story-tellers in the United States felt an attraction to the more popular, generic appeal of the comic strip, its ability to range from the joke to issues of cosmic importance, and its deflation of the high seriousness of modernist fiction between the World Wars. Knowing that the world was changed forever by technological violence, post-modern, post-World-War II writers in North America still went <em class="emph">out</em> into the world, they researched their themes, at times exhaustively, seeking power in knowledge. These writers sought not just literary materials, but also political alternatives in the countries where they traveled: Allende's Chile, Castro's Cuba, Mao's China, America itself during the colonial, revolutionary, and antebellum eras.

Repetitions and recurrences abound, contexts multiply but there is never a design-governing principle that would allow a narrative or an argument to develop.
