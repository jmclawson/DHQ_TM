This subject’s engagements with media and, by way of media, with other subjects, are determined by relations founded on language which French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan terms the <em class="term">social bond</em> of discourse.</p><p>I propose that modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital field, particularly as the field shifts towards a more unified disciplinarity and a more secure institutional footing, can be described in relation to the graphs of Lacan’s "four discourses" – of the University, Master, Hysteric, and Analyst. I conclude that deliberate reflection on structures of our research and pedagogy, mapped by the graphs, may lead us beyond the confidence games of the master and the University – on and by which our inquiries are founded and oriented, but also narrowed – to the side of the hysteric and the analyst, whose collaborations are more productive of new forms of knowledge.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Returning to the Subject at Hand</h1><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/resources/images/fig1.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/resources/images/fig1.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div><blockquote><p class="ptext">Venetian blinds for television.

[<a class="ref" href="#lennon2009">Lennon 2009</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e137">[1]</a></p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The digital field’s preoccupation with presentism and futurism – and the periodizing that balancing between them requires (marking off "first" from "second" waves, "golden" from "silver" ages, and so on) – lends itself to fantasies of change that are familiar to anyone who has thought much about how we have got to where we are. But the temporalities of media, and in their own way – different from but dependent on the qualities of their objects – the temporalities of media disciplines, are more irregular than talk of ages and waves can encompass. As Lennon observes, the <em class="term">always already new</em> figures "a more absorbent fold, perhaps" than <em class="term">remediation</em>. Bolter and Grusin’s influential formulation of that concept entails a modern, progressive medial evolution, repeatable and accessible to measurement – and on that basis, accessible also to a progressive media theorization [<a class="ref" href="#bolter1999">Bolter 1999</a>]. In contrast, the always-already aims at experiences of change that are tangled in their way of marking time: looking ahead, but also visited by atavisms and negativities that make imagining what lies ahead a messier undertaking, subject to uncanny feedback systems.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">A case in point is represented by the two episodes that frame Lennon’s reflection on new media’s turn to historical reflexivity. The first of these is the publication during the 1990s of Michael Joyce’s critical writings on digital media and culture, "untimely" in Lennon’s estimation and overshadowed by the attention given to Joyce’s hypertext fictions of the same period. The second is Joyce’s subsequent withdrawal from literary-critical circles whose other members imagined themselves to be following his lead – the significance of which, Lennon notes, may be discerned in the shocked silence with which that withdrawal has been met.<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e170">[2]</a> Here, Lennon ingeniously traverses this disappearing act which continues to leave its mark. Joyce’s secession in or around 2004, he proposes, should be read not as a retreat from literary-critical dialogue, but an act of provocation directed at a culture of scholarship that had been too hastily constituted from Joyce’s precedent, and was unselfconsciously (and is still) spinning away from the complexities of that precedent. Lennon contrasts the <em class="term">essayism</em> of Joyce’s criticism of this period – the errant, unfinished, and dissatisfied voice of his writing, more radical in its way of acting out than was his hyperfiction – with a more controlled and compact critical attitude that seems increasingly characteristic of American new media studies.
         <blockquote><p>The reduction of Joyce to hyperfiction author, in the new media studies scholarship that more or less brackets Joyce’s critical project, is in fact nothing new as a disciplinary gesture; rather, it is a repetition of the founding ruse of literary-critical modernity, in what Clifford Siskin has called "novelism": the generation, from a heterogenous and yet unified (or combined and uneven) field of writing, of the separate positions of the self-identified critic and her critical object, produced by the writer. In the subordination of writing, a discourse and an institution, to the (fabricated) research object "the novel," modern disciplinarity in the literary sphere naturalizes writing as mimesis – that is, <em class="emph">gives it a job to do</em>, in determined opposition to the radical self-reflexivity of writing as mass professionalization itself, in its capacity simultaneously to expand and to contract the division of intellectual labor. [<a class="ref" href="#lennon2009">Lennon 2009</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Joyce’s stopping out, Lennon surmises, was at least in part in response to his reduction to the role of its most important critical test case [<a class="ref" href="#harpold2008">Harpold 2008</a>, 6.01]. It was also (and I think this among the most important implications of Lennon’s reading of his framing episodes) an expression of dissatisfaction derived from Joyce’s earlier way of writing out his relation as critic to the objects of his criticism. Sacrificed in the field’s coalescing around the novelist mode of research is some of the raw productivity of writing and reading in the essayist mode. There, media are met in a more relational way, and without much assurance concerning what they make happen – in, as Joyce had observed, the "momentary awkwardness" of an encounter with something that may be unprecedented [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1995">Joyce 1995</a>, 219–26]. If, as Lennon proposes, new media’s discovery of an always-already-new temporality is a sign of its arriving at a position of more unified disciplinarity, this has involved setting aside the excesses of first wave theorists such as Joyce. That is a way of effectively focusing on the job at hand, but only at the cost of repressing some of its complexity, or the complexity of our imagining that there is a job or jobs, and not instead some aggregates of unfinished and uncompletable – <span class="foreign i">unendliche</span>[<a class="ref" href="#freud1937">Freud 1937</a>] – encounters. Repressing, that is, styles of critical engagement that are less confident of their security and more anxious (or euphoric) about media’s inmixing of subjects and objects, which anxiety (and euphoria) Joyce’s essayist precedents brilliantly exemplified.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Four Turns</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">I want to give shape to this line of reasoning along four turns of language, which I draw from the graphs French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan named the "four discourses," introduced in his XVIIth seminar, <cite class="title italic">L’Envers de la psychanalyse</cite> ("The Other Side of Psychoanalysis," 1969–70; [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1991a">Lacan 1991a</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>]).<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e226">[3]</a> The graphs figure (in the order in which I will discuss them) the discourses of the <em class="emph">University</em>, the <em class="emph">Master</em>, the <em class="emph">Hysteric</em>, and the <em class="emph">Analyst</em> (Figures 5–8). Each describes relations of the linguistic foundations, subjects, and objects of knowledge in a different way, according to different structural relations of those elements. By extension, each of the graphs figures distinctive, but related, disciplinary practices, the efficiencies of which are characterized by these different structural relations. At the risk of disclosing the punch line before most of the work of setting it up, my claim is the four discourses describe the dominant effects of modes of critical engagement and teaching in the contemporary digital field. The graphs’ descriptions of these modes demonstrate how it is that we got to where we are, and point toward other, I think more productive, paths of disciplinary practice.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The graphs of the four discourses are highly formalized, and the typographic and terminological units they circulate have specific meanings in Lacan’s thought. Once these units are defined, the graphs operate on them with a notable directness and concreteness; they perform the relations they describe. (<span class="hi italic">Dēscrībō: they write out these relations.</span>) In this regard, the graphs are uniquely productive, in that they generate from determinate conditions of knowledge, new forms of knowledge. What I am after in this essay is a way, with the graphs of the four discourses also in hand, of taking hold of recent critical and teaching practices of the digital field, with the dual aim of illustrating logics of those practices and of <em class="emph">making something new out of them</em>. Before putting the graphs to work in this way, it is necessary to move programmatically through their terms and shapes, so as to engage their effects. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Units of Discourse</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Prior to 1969, Lacan’s uses of the term "discourse" [<span class="foreign i">discours</span>] are largely consistent with Émile Benveniste’s influential definition: "discourse is language put into action, and necessarily between partners"[<a class="ref" href="#benveniste1971">Benveniste 1971</a>, 223]; "[it is] every utterance assuming a speaker and a hearer, and in the speaker, the intention of influencing the other in some way"[<a class="ref" href="#benveniste1971">Benveniste 1971</a>, 209].<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e298">[4]</a> That definition fits with the specific social-linguistic relation of the psychoanalytic clinic (see for example, Benveniste 1971, 223–30); for Lacan, it applies more generally to the encounters of the speaking subject with the entire field of language (the symbolic order, the "big-O" Other), which disturbances of speech in the clinic bring to the foreground. Thus, "every bungled action is a successful, even 'well-phrased' discourse"[<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 222]; "the first resistance analysis faces is that of discourse itself"[<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 348]; and the many variations in Lacan’s teaching on "the unconscious is the Other’s discourse" (for example, [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 316]).<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e324">[5]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Beginning with the introduction of the four discourses in Seminar XVII, Lacan amplifies discourse’s knotting of its interlocutors: discourse is now characterized as "a social bond [<span class="foreign i">lien social</span>], founded on language [<span class="foreign i">langage</span>]" (1972–73, [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1998b">Lacan 1998b</a>, 16–17]). This formula echoes Saussure’s definition of language [<span class="foreign i">langue</span>] as a "social product of the faculty of speech" [<a class="ref" href="#saussure1966">Saussure 1966</a>, 13] but, crucially, shifts the locus of sociality from the abstract code of langue (the system of signs deployed in speech [<span class="foreign i">parole</span>]) to the material circulation of signifiers between speaker and addressee.<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e355">[6]</a> In this reading, the social bond is realized in a concrete, dynamic exchange in which subjects recognize each other and themselves according to (conscious and unconscious, present and past) relations of signifiers. Those relations are determinate; the sociality of the bond obtains, so far as Lacan is concerned, wholly in signifying operations, not in the conventions of langue or as a consequence of the positive content of speech.<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e375">[7]</a></div><div id="figure02" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/resources/images/fig2.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/resources/images/fig2.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>The master signifier (S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>) and the field of knowledge (S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>).</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Lacan builds the graphs of the four discourses within this material-relational schema of speech by mapping it onto circulations of four terms which are of particular significance in his teaching: S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>, the master signifier; S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>, the field of knowledge; $, the divided subject; and <em class="term">a</em>, the <span class="foreign i">objet petit a</span>. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">The master signifier (S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>, <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>) orients the expression and reception of discourse [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 13]. In this role it is comparable to the famous "quilting point" [<span class="foreign i">point de capiton</span>], the site of convergence in a signifying chain in relation to which the rest of the chain is situated, retrospectively and prospectively [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1993">Lacan 1993</a>, 268], [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 681]. We are familiar with the master signifiers of the digital field; as scholars and teachers we traffic in them and appropriate them to new ends: terms like <em class="term">avatar</em>, <em class="term">home</em>, <em class="term">interface</em>, <em class="term">screen</em>, <em class="term">trail</em>, and proper names like Bush, Engelbart, Nelson, and so on. Our fluency in them is a sign of disciplinary competence, and the invention of new master signifiers a key to our professional success. Our speech is bound to contours introduced by S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>; we can’t imagine what we achieve in discourse without it [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 129–30, 188]. Consequently, Lacan accords this signifier<span class="hi subscript"/>a special importance: there is no anchor of a discourse’s reference, or the subject’s position in the field of speech, except by way of S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>s cleaving off from other signifiers as their support and alibi [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 189]. As Lacan envisages it, this is a strictly formal operation; whatever positive content S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> may be imagined to convey in other contexts is irrelevant to its function in this regard.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> (<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>) figures the battery of signifiers whose network constitutes the knowledge (<span class="foreign i">savoir</span>) transmitted by a discourse, in which S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> intervenes as a point of reference, as the term that anchors the expression of knowledge. The temporality of the intervention is ambiguous. Strictly speaking, S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> may precede S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> as a mere aggregate of signifiers, gathered incidentally to the situation in which speech (an ordered chain of signifiers) comes to function as discourse (a social bond founded on language). S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>s intervention in S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> makes it appear – that is, effectively makes it come to pass – that S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> specific to this discourse articulates an "already structured field of knowledge"[<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 13], for which S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> stands, retrospectively, as its support. In this way, S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> impresses order on the expression of S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>, in relation to which the speaking subject recognizes itself and others by way of their adherence to S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>, as a style or idiom of a shared vocabulary. When we identify ourselves as "new media scholars and teachers" or "digital humanists," and more so, as scholars and teachers operating within more narrowly-defined subfields ("game studies,""platform studies,""software studies"), we situate our speech within fields of knowledge (S<span class="hi subscript">2 </span>) that are contoured by specific master signifiers; we acknowledge the subjection of our speech to the relations of S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> and S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>.</div><div id="figure03" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/resources/images/fig3.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/resources/images/fig3.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 3. </div>The split subject ($) and the object petit a.</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">$ (<a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>) figures the split or divided subject.

A shifter [<span class="foreign i">embrayeur</span>] is a linguistic element whose meaning cannot be determined without taking into account that a sender and a receiver are engaged in an act of communication [<a class="ref" href="#jakobson1990">Jakobson 1990</a>, 398].<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e631">[10]</a> There are many species of shifters [<a class="ref" href="#ducrot1979">Ducrot 1979</a>, 252, 324ff], but first and second person pronouns represent the plainest examples: the terms "I" and "you" designate a particular person – the one who speaks, or the one to or about whom is spoken – only in the context of a speech act. There, the shifter is associated with that person by convention ("you" = the woman to whom I speak; in Peircian terms, the shifter "symbolizes" her), while at the same time it points to her by virtue of an immediate, existential relation to the speech act; it concerns specific conditions of the speech act as well as she. ("You" = the woman to whom I speak here and now, in the scene of speech; the shifter "indexes" her. Jakobson calls shifters "indexical symbols"[<a class="ref" href="#jakobson1990">Jakobson 1990</a>, 388]).<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e663">[11]</a> For Lacan, the duplex aspect of the shifter is evidence of the relationality of discourse, particularly with regard to the speaker. When I speak of myself ("I speak"), the agent for and of whom I speak, and the signifier that figures that agent in speech are not ontologically coincident; the first person pronoun designates only a point of contact between this supposed agent and a signifier. Furthermore, the signifier and this supposed agent can only seem to coincide in that my speech is directed to an other (my addressee – "you" – but more concretely, another signifier, <span class="hi italic">ju</span>:), in relation to which the signifier I (<span class="hi italic">aɪ</span>) has meaning. (According to Lacan’s famous dictum, "The definition of a signifier is that it represents the subject not for another subject but for another signifier"[<a class="ref" href="#lacan1972b">Lacan 1972b</a>, 194][<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 47–48].) Moreover, because Lacan treats the shifter as an indexical <em class="term">signifier</em><span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#evans1996">#evans1996</a></span>, its notional reference, contingent on the structure of the speech act, is subordinated to patterns of the signifying chain.

The statement [<span class="foreign i">énoncé</span>] is the chain of signifiers that appears to stand apart from the speech act in place of things and events to which the speech act refers. The subject of the statement is the agent designated (or implied to have been designated) thereby. The enunciation [<span class="foreign i">énonciation</span>] is the speech act as it takes place in the here and now of an utterance. Its agent exists only in the moment of the utterance, and is immediately thereafter eclipsed by the subject of the statement. It is the illusion of a continuous present in speech, Benveniste says, which sutures the temporal split between these subjects [<a class="ref" href="#benveniste1971">Benveniste 1971</a>, 227]. For Lacan, this split (<span class="foreign i">refente</span>) is another consequence of the determinate effect of the signifying chain as evidenced in the shifter [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 650], which designates the subject of the enunciation (viz., associates that vanishing entity retrospectively with the subject of the statement) but does not signify that subject, in the way that Lacan understands "signifierness" [<span class="foreign i">significance</span>] to mean a dynamic interplay of elements of the chain in the here-and-now [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 677, 764–65].

In this regard, the DU operates with notable, even laudable, effect. It’s just that the DU isn’t efficacious only in the way that we might wish as we go about revising our research reports, forming working groups, lobbying our administrators for funding and hires, preparing our syllabi, and training our students. We recognize this on some level, and so we condition the products of our labors with forecasts of refinements and convictions that old problems will be resolved or set aside as no longer applicable under new conditions. Or, conversely, with convictions that the old problems may be better addressed under more expansive rubrics (<em class="term">hypertext studies</em> and <em class="term">game studies</em> are thus drawn into the penumbras of <em class="term">comparative media studies</em> or digital humanities), and if we house their practitioners in already-established divisions of the university.

The DM’s penchant for bold ruptures and the DU’s devotion to evidence are not incompatible; both have the alibi of S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> to guarantee that we will figure out what we’re about once we get down to real work. What undercuts that guarantee is that a fundamental maladaptation of the subject to the cause of this work: ($ ◊ <em class="term">a</em>); clever obscurantism and pellucid empiricism function as two faces of a single coin. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">But more generally, the mutuality of the DM and the DU is evidence of a principle that is clear in Lacan’s treatment of the discourses and which has to be kept in mind in any squaring off of the four: none operates in complete isolation from the others.

It would be incorrect to say that the hysteric cannot take hold of the conditions of her suffering, as she is perfectly capable of demonstrating these to one who cares to listen [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 34, 83].<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e1458">[31]</a> Her knowledge is, however, distinctly productive in a way in that it cannot on its own be brought to closure or stable reflection; hers is, says Lacan, a knowledge that doesn’t know that it knows itself (<span class="foreign i">un savoir qui ne se sait pas</span>, [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 33], trans. modified.), but which finds its expression in the presence of an other, the analyst who knows how to listen.
         </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">A substantial body of work in the digital field is characterized by one of two styles of the DH. The first style resembles the subject Verhaeghe (ironically) terms the "good" hysteric [<a class="ref" href="#verhaeghe1995">Verhaeghe 1995</a>]. She is devoted to the master, and acts as if expressions of her faith in him (S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>/S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>) are something in which he is deeply invested. She obscures her frustrations and measures her provisional satisfactions in the conviction that these labors will one day bring about the master’s enjoyment, and vicariously her own. The paradox lies in that the hysteric wants the master’s dissatisfaction – she seeks it, she lacks for it – in order that she may (also) desire [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 518]; [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 129].<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e1497">[32]</a> In the digital field, such devotion to the master’s enjoyment is expressed in visions of seamless immersion and the erasure of divisions between language and the real – which divisions, if we take Lacan seriously, must be understood to be uneraseable because they determine the subject <span class="foreign i">qua</span> speaking subject ($ / <span class="foreign i">a</span>; [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 712]). Early 1990s fantasies in this vein, of totalizing virtualities and "post-symbolic" communication now have been set aside, even by ardent proponents (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#lanier2011">Lanier 2011</a>]), but related fantasies of transcendence are still vigorous in some strands of posthumanist thought. In actuality, they are only more exacting forms of subjection, the hysteric’s version of the master’s millennial breakout. In pop-cultural accounts of the technological singularity in particular (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#kurzweil2005">Kurzweil 2005</a>]), the master’s imprint on desire is evident in the conviction that human self-interest, or the interest of an Other that recognizes humanity as its friend or enemy, must span the divide of the transformative event.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">In contrast, the second style of the DH resembles Verhaeghe’s "bad" hysteric [<a class="ref" href="#verhaeghe1995">Verhaeghe 1995</a>]. She is uncooperative and openly frustrated with the master’s responses to her elaborate demonstrations. In this uncooperative mode, her style more nearly grasps her discourse’s dependence on S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>, in that she presses the master to show his hand ($ → S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>) by way of innovating signifiers (S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>) expressing her dissatisfaction. This style of the DH more openly acknowledges the efficacy of its structure, as it puts the master’s caprice to productive work, not as the DU would (conjecturing that eventually the effects of structure may be transcended), but by insisting on the irresolution of the hysteric’s desire.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">In the digital field, examples of this style of the DH include in particular those interrogations that openly confront the subject’s inmixing with her objects of analysis. Joyce’s criticism (1995, 2000, 2001), written in a voice I would characterize as unambiguously hysterical, is the type of this form of writing out that acts out the uncompletability of the critic’s desire – in Lennon’s terminology, writing out desire in the essayist mode, in contrast to the DU’s effort to situate critic and object on distinct registers, in the novelist mode. Other landmark examples include: Shelley Jackson’s dexterous stitchings of her fictional and critical personae (e.g., 1995, 1998); John Cayley’s (e.g., 2004, 2010), Loss Pequeño Glazier’s (e.g., 2002, 2006) and Talan Memmot’s (e.g., 2001) contributions to a digital poetics in which coding and coded voices are robustly inmixed; Stuart Moulthrop’s excursions in the garden and the library (e.g., 1991, 1999), which were more concerned with the relationality of hypertext writing and reading than their efficiencies; Mark Hansen’s intimate reflections on new media affectivity (2004, 2006); Hayles’s method of "autocritography" (2002); and Ulmer’s invention methodologies of the "mystory" and "MEmorial" (1989, 1994, 2005). This is the style of interrogation I aimed to activate in <cite class="title italic">Ex-foliations</cite> (2008) by first, insisting that critics should hew closely to Roland Barthes’s original definition of the lexia in order to seize the term’s generative potential in hypertext criticism, as a name (S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>) for field effects (S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>) of reading [<a class="ref" href="#harpold2008">Harpold 2008</a>, 1.44]; and second, by associating these effects with what I termed the reader’s <em class="term">historiation</em>, her conscious and unconscious recollection of her reading history. Or, to write this out in the style of the bad hysteric: a retrospective gathering signifiers in a dissatisfied present ($ / <em class="term">a</em> → S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>) – leading to further, unresolved dissatisfactions and further gatherings – is a way forward to new forms of knowledge, when this activity is directed at the one who cares to listen [<a class="ref" href="#harpold2008">Harpold 2008</a>, 1.55–1.56]. Such a generative writing out in the style of the DH need not dominate all aspects of the critical encounter. It may be expressed as a punctual interruption of a writing out in another discourse or style. The pattern of discourse is invariable (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>), but the positions of the terms in play will be determined by specific provocations of the social bond. The key is to remain open to these provocations and their unsettling effects, even as disciplinary formations tend to dampen those effects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e1575">[33]</a></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Discourse of the Analyst</h1><div id="figure08" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/resources/images/fig8.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000141/resources/images/fig8.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 8. </div>The Discourse of the Analyst (1969–70; [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 39]).</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">The graph of the Discourse of the Analyst (DA, <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>) figures the social bond in the scene of the psychoanalytic clinic.

In other words, in the social relation of the analyst and the hysteric (DA → DH). </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">In a nutshell, that is the diagnosis and the prescription that I propose here. But such a formula has important consequences for the future of our field, if that is to be as productive as it has been during the last two decades, and if a shift to a more unified disciplinarity and a more secure institutional footing is not to come at the cost of a former uncompletability that made very interesting things come to pass. This is nowhere more true than in the social bond of our teaching. The graphs of the four discourses show us that the more productive pedagogy is not in the style of the master, which occludes the subject’s division and spits out as its remainder the object-cause of desire (S<span class="hi subscript">1 </span>→ S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> / <em class="term">a</em>). Nor is it in the style of the University, which reifies the subject’s division by promising eventual mastery over desire (S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> /S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> → <em class="term">a</em>). Much like the neurotic’s just-so stories, that is just a form of temporizing. The more productive pedagogy is one that sustains desire by way of the <em class="term">hysterization</em> of the subject in response to something enigmatic, the operation of which is signaled in the field of speech <span class="foreign i">qua</span> social bond [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 33]. There, the place of the agent is not occupied by the digital object, its technical frameworks, or a conjectural entity supposed to "interact" with these things (a <em class="term">user</em>) – but, more generally, by those aspects of the interrogation which take on the role of an enigmatic, generative element (<em class="term">a</em>), to which we and our students respond, a little unnerved and uncertain. In the model of the DH we can grasp that the eccentricity of the <span class="foreign i">objet petit a</span> is foundational to the subject’s interrogation of the conditions of her knowledge. In the model of the DA, by way of its engagement with the DH, we can grasp a positive effect of this always-outsideness of the <span class="foreign i">a</span>: it can serve as the agent of the production of new and destabilized forms of knowledge – the DA as a disappearing act that leaves (behind) its mark [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 23].<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e1809">[38]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">Such an engagement of the DH and DA would be consistent with Joyce’s observation that our awkwardness may (still) be to our advantage. Dissatisfaction, befuddlement, and persistent misprision (the hysteric’s modes of relation) and a hesitation to be, or appear to be, confident of one’s reading of things (the analyst’s reflective response) need not be taken as evidence of lapsed knowledge; they may be acknowledgements of how the scene of knowledge is structured and carried through to its aims. If we profess from the position of supposed knowledge that our charges imagine for us, this will be most effective if we don’t take the supposition seriously, or not for long. We may foster supposition in situations in which this tends toward the building of foundations and the applications of lexicons (DM → DU): for example, instructing our students in the combinatorial play of the field’s master signifiers, which is a prerequisite for disciplinary competence. Such a tactic is in the short run disingenuous. But in the long run it may be productive of new signifiers if we, after a time, also renounce some of the authority invested in us, so as to desuppose the knowledge imagined to to be attached to that authority (DA → DH). We might call into question – even peremptorily, as is our due – master signifiers and the scaffolding built from them; perhaps even the notion of disciplinary competence itself. Shifting the scene of discourse from supposition to desupposition does not preclude speaking with conviction or making profitable use of the tools at our disposal ("consensus and canons, anthologies, archaeologies and folksonomies, and the like"). <em class="emph">But desupposing, not supposing, is the impulse of a more innovative knowledge production</em>[<a class="ref" href="#lacan1998b">Lacan 1998b</a>, 67]. It entails attending to, even signaling to our charges, our and their irreducibly relational engagements with the elements of the social bond. A lesson of the four discourses is that such an attending and a signaling must be initiated by more radical breaks with the master than readjusting our (or their) <span class="foreign i">a prioris</span>. And that these breaks have to be perpetually renewed so that they don’t lapse into merely new variants of supposed knowledge.<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e1841">[39]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">We are committed, by institutional and professional conditions, to practices that tend toward the imperiousness of the DM and the recursive fiddling of the DU. But another of the lessons of the four discourses is that any one, two, or three discourses must operate in some relation to the others. Within a general economy of knowledge transmission, the primary stated goals of which are to "advance" the discipline and maximize the understanding of the scholar and the student, we could take such a lesson to heart and press the misdirections of imperiousness and fiddling to other, more relational ends. This means, along with the analyst, siding with the hysteric instead of the master, with the deliberate aim of getting her to grasp that what she wants (lacks) is the expression of the master’s desire (that which he lacks, but cannot have). And of making something come to pass thereby: new turns of the circuit of discourses and new master signifiers, in relation to which the hysteric and her master will be newly subjectified. (Doesn’t my description of the exemplary hysteria of Joyce’s early criticism, and Lennon’s accounting of Joyce’s withdrawal into spectrality as an act of provocation, imply that Joyce has, by his own admission [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1995">Joyce 1995</a>]; <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#joyce2000">#joyce2000</a></span>, played exactly this game of double-mindedness?)<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e1866">[40]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Playing at the tangle of those relations is neither a heroic nor a cynical response to the laws of desire; the hysteric and the analyst don’t aim to nullify the laws, only to recalibrate their effects, shaking loose the master’s confidence that he knows what he is talking about, and the bureaucrat’s determination that he will do even better – to, in other words, make something new come out of the laws of desire that confidence and determination might hide away ($ → S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> / S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> : <em class="term">a</em> → $ / S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>). In a mode of rigorous relationality in which the irreducibility of the laws of desire is acknowledged, one can look ahead, along a path from the impostures of the DM and DU toward (and beyond) the impasses of the DH and DA. Such a change in our point of view would be endlessly unsettled and unsettling, and for that reason, of authentic consequence for our discipline.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Postscript on Method: Metaphor of Discourse</h1><blockquote><p class="ptext">"The cat goes bow-wow, the dog goes meow, meow."

            <a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e2146">[44]</a> This is how Lacan understands the production of meaning in the signifying chain, and primordially in the "paternal metaphor" that founds Oedipus.<a class="noteRef" href="#d42221e2157">[45]</a> Second, because Lacan correlates this driving of a signifier below the bar with secondary repression (<span class="foreign i">Verdrängung</span>, <span class="foreign i">refoulement</span>: [<a class="ref" href="#freud1915">Freud 1915</a>]), metaphor’s production of a "new species of signification" is homologous with repression’s production of new signified effects from the exclusion of signifiers from consciousness [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1998a">Lacan 1998a</a>, 218].

In "Radiophonie" (the redacted transcript of a 1970 interview on Belgian radio, [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2001">Lacan 2001</a>, 403–47]), Lacan introduces modifications to the graphs to which he had alluded in Seminar XVII [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1971">Lacan 1971</a>, 203], adding a curved arrow beneath the bars pointing in the direction opposite to the arrow above the bars – that is, pointing back from production to the truth – and labels on the arrow on the top, "impossibility," and the arrow on the bottom, "powerlessness" or "inability" ["<span class="foreign i">l'impuissance</span>"]. (See [<a class="ref" href="#nobus2005">Nobus 2005</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#verhaeghe1995">Verhaeghe 1995</a>] for well-developed readings of these additions. I will address their relevance to my applications of the discourses below.) Seminar XVIII (1971) reproduces the graphs in nearly the same forms, with one notable change: the Discourse of the Master (DM) is shown with arrows crossing from the lower left and right terms up to the opposing terms on above the bars, and a dotted line drawn between the terms below the bars (March 17, 1971). The new glyphs were added, we may presume, to emphasize the indirection of relations between S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> and a, $ and S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>, that the DM installs, also characteristic of relations of the terms in the other discourses. Seminar XX (1972–73) reproduces the "Radiophonie" versions of the graphs. The DM and Discourse of the Analyst (DA) are repeated in new variants in Seminars XIX (1971–71 [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2011">Lacan 2011</a>]) and XXI (1973–74 [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1973">Lacan 1973–74</a>]). In Seminar XIX, the DA is shown with a left-pointing arrow under the bars [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2011">Lacan 2011</a>, 139], to emphasize the determination of S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> by S<span class="hi subscript">1</span>. Later in the seminar [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2011">Lacan 2011</a>, 193], Lacan substitutes for the positions <em class="term">agent</em>, <em class="term">other</em> and <em class="term">production</em>, the terms <em class="term">semblant</em>, <em class="term">jouissance</em> and <em class="term">plus-de-jouir</em> (see above, note 14), presumably to note the patient’s supposition of the analyst’s agency, and the productive effect of the patient’s jouissance. In Seminar XXI, the DA is shown with arrows traversing the bars, pointing up from the lower left, and down from the upper right, perhaps to emphasize the rotation between terms that generates the production, S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> (Nov. 20, 1973), as such a rotation was implied in earlier variants. In this seminar, the DM is shown with the crossed arrows and dotted line of the Seminar XVIII DM variant. It is hard to decide upon the specific significances of these variations of the graphs. Lacan’s continued manipulation of them is evidence of his putting them to work in different conditions of his teaching.</div><div class="endnote" id="d42221e1023"><span class="noteRef">[18]</span>Though it is a mainstay of critic’s descriptions of the four discourses, Lacan seems not to have written out the labels shown in <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a> for the attendees of his seminars. The apparent exception is [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1998b">Lacan 1998b</a>], but it is likely that this key was added by the seminar’s editor. Neither the graphs nor the diagram of the positions appear in an unofficial transcription of the seminar [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1972a">Lacan 1972a</a>], and that text, substantially different from the official version, indicates that Lacan expected his audience simply to be familiar with the graphs.</div><div class="endnote" id="d42221e1040"><span class="noteRef">[19]</span>Prefatory to that which follows, I should say that I take seriously Dany Nobus and Malcolm Quinn’s injunction that "the introduction of Lacanian discourse theory [in extra-clinical applications] ought to have a limiting or circumscribing effect on knowledge itself.

The allure of the University discourse is particularly strong in a setting such as this; that discourse in particular is adept at covertly shuttling the master back to a controlling position, with all the impostures of understanding that this entails, and which the simplicity (and extensibility) of the graphs may seem to authorize. What I have tried to do is to allow the graphs to work in their own way — like levers or pliers [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2007">Lacan 2007</a>, 169] — in relation to the recent history of an emerging discipline: unsettled and unsettling, and in the relational mood I characterize below as "double-mindedness." This does not reduce the social bond of speech in the digital field to the mere quadratures of four diagrams. Rather than circumscribing conditions of knowledge in the field, it should, if I have been successful, demonstrate the instability and uncompletability of those conditions, and show the way forward to more productive expressions of them.</div><div class="endnote" id="d42221e1096"><span class="noteRef">[20]</span>Thus, S<span class="hi subscript">2</span> is related to a by the disjunction of the impossibility [<a class="ref" href="#verhaeghe1995">Verhaeghe 1995</a>] of the former to capture the latter, and $ is related to S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> by the disjunction of the powerlessness of the master to escape effects of his insertion in the field of speech.

I think it significant, then, that in a moment in which Kirschenbaum slips, melancholiac, from the assurance of the DU into the scene I have termed (after Lacan) an inmixing of critic and object, and which I have associated with the DH’s expression of endless dissatisfaction, he sends a message to (another instance of) himself: $ → S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> / S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>.</div><div class="endnote" id="d42221e1636"><span class="noteRef">[34]</span> We may say that in the DA, the <em class="term">a</em> and $ are related by the disjunction of impossibility because the analyst can only be supposed to occupy its place for a time.

His focus is on increasingly forceful appeals for a "return" in that scene to stable, well-measured disciplinarity, and consequently a turn away from the messy uncompletability of "theory" and "cultural studies" – in which appeals those terms are master signifiers used in a pejorative mood. "The champions of disciplined thought," Wegner writes, "see themselves as occupying the position of masters. The truth is that they are fully ensconced in the order of the university, eschewing the risk of encounter involved in the actual production of knowledge… for a repetitious structure of institutional reproduction." Standing in opposition to such a pattern of mere repetition, Wegner argues, is the dialectical productivity – and in that the scandalously theoretical intervention – of Lacan’s formalizations of the discourses. I don’t think it a stretch to propose that a retreat in the digital field, away from (imagined) excesses of the first wave, might be gathered under a general trend in the academy, marked by Wegner, of a turning from/repression of unsettled and rigorously counterdisciplinary ways of thinking (and thinking about and performing writing), in pursuit of regularized practices that insure greater disciplinary unity.</div><div class="endnote" id="d42221e1841"><span class="noteRef">[39]</span>In the audience during the first reading of this essay (see <a href="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a>) were a half-dozen or so students in an undergraduate hypermedia course I was teaching at the time. Their dismay in response to the parade of glyphs and graphs – operations of which were implicit in the course’s method but which had not been shown as such until then – and at being accounted as admirably bad hysterics, was evident. The first question of the next class meeting was, "What do you mean when you say that you want to turn us all into hysterics?" Which wasn’t, of course, what I had said. I attempted to seize the edge of a teaching moment, replying that what I meant should have been clear enough from what I had said, even though I hadn’t said it in that way before. I proposed that a more productive way in which to frame the question might be, "What do you want from us when you say, in our presence, that we should be hysterized?" – which indicates that my desire should take the hindmost role in the operation at hand, or that the interplay of their and my desires should remain always unsettled. With all the benefits of hindsight, I see now that this question, this <em class="emph">what do you want from us?</em>, is a version of the demand I identified, what now seems ages ago, as the key problem of a certain foundational moment of the digital field [<a class="ref" href="#harpold1994">Harpold 1994</a>].</div><div class="endnote" id="d42221e1866"><span class="noteRef">[40]</span>Cf.

Doesn’t a shift in discursive structure from that of the DH to that of the DA articulate this change of Joyce’s position within the mythology of the field? If secession were understood to invite desupposition, then the family romance built up around Joyce’s early hyperfiction, which has, for good or ill, contoured the field from its inception [<a class="ref" href="#harpold2008">Harpold 2008</a>, 6.01], might be (re)written (out) in a new and more productive form. </div><div class="endnote" id="d42221e1918"><span class="noteRef">[41]</span>The formula as shown here appears in Lacan’s essay "Metaphor of the Subject" (1961) [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 755–58]. It reprises, with a few modifications, diagrams from "On a Question Prior to Any Possible Treatment of Psychosis" (1959) [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 464], a summary of Lacan’s third Seminar, on the psychoses (1955–56) [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1993">Lacan 1993</a>], and [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1998c">Lacan 1998c</a>, 176], the fifth Seminar, on formations of the unconscious (1957–58). These instances of the formula are recognizably reworkings of the classic Lacanian "algorithm" of metaphoric structure as given in "The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious" (1957) [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 429, 756].<br/><br/>Of note in the 1959 formula, the positions of S´<span class="hi subscript">1</span> and S´<span class="hi subscript">2</span> are occupied by two instances of the same symbol, $´. But the use of a barred S in this formula is somewhat confusing, as Lacan does not appear to refer thus to the divided subject (<a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>, above), but to "the elision of S´, represented in the formula by the fact that it is crossed out, [which] is the condition of the metaphor’s success"[<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 465]. (Thus only one signifier [S´] is elided, rather than two potentially different signifiers [S<span class="hi subscript">1</span> and S<span class="hi subscript">2</span>], which makes the substitution at work here somewhat clearer.) It is possible to read an echo of the divided subject in this version of the formula for metaphor – given that "the definition of a signifier is that it represents the subject not for another subject but for another signifier," etc. – and Lacan uses $ to figure the divided subject elsewhere in the same essay [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 487n14]. But that does not seem to be the primary function of the symbol here. As in the case of the variants of the graphs of the four discourses (see note 19, above), Lacan during this period revises the formulae to fit conditions of his teaching.<br/><br/></div><div class="endnote" id="d42221e2003"><span class="noteRef">[42]</span><a href="#figure09">Figure 9</a> shows a majuscule "I" in the position of the numerator in <span class="hi superscript">I</span>/<em class="term">s</em>´´, as in [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1966">Lacan 1966</a>, 890]. In Fink’s translation, this character is shown as an Arabic numeral "1". Treating "I" as a Roman numeral would be in keeping with uses of the character in other mathemes reproduced in [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1966">Lacan 1966</a>] (2006) – see for example, 55(42), 515 (428) and 819 (694); "I" = "1" in these cases appears to be a typographic convention of Éditions du Seuil, the French publisher of Lacan’s canonical works. (See however [<a class="ref" href="#lacan1998c">Lacan 1998c</a>, 176], where an Arabic "1" is used as the numerator in a variant of the extended formula.) In that reading, the signified’s fractional form (<span class="hi superscript">1</span>/<em class="term">s</em>´´) indicates its subordination to relations of the signifiers (S, S´<span class="hi subscript">1</span>, S´<span class="hi subscript">2</span>; [<a class="ref" href="#lacan2006">Lacan 2006</a>, 459]). But one commentator [<a class="ref" href="#dor1998">Dor 1998</a>] has interpreted the numerator (I) as a symbol for "l’Inconscient," the unconscious.
