          Ohio</cite>, while it cannot be considered a text straightforwardly concerned with
          technology, offers a modernist version of the story cycle that anticipates the delocalized
          and highly structured interconnections facilitated by the network. Unlike today’s
          seamlessly embedded networks, however, the prototypical form depicted in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> functions as a kluge, "an ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a
              distressing whole" [<a class="ref" href="#oed">OED</a>]. Anderson’s kluge augurs network technology and therefore suggests that the form
          loomed large in modernists’ mind. However, <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite>
          illustrates the network’s propensity to foster users’ inner alienation while enabling
          their unprecedented connection and thereby warns against the antagonistic quality of the
          network’s rhizomatic structure.</p></div><div class="div div0"><div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p class="ptext">The network is the great Outside that always surrounds and envelops
              me. But it is also the Inside: its alien circuitry is what I find when I look deeply
              within myself. The network is impersonal, universal, without a center, but it is also
              perturbingly intimate, uncannily close at hand. (<a href="#shaviro2003">Steven Shaviro, <cite class="title italic">Connected</cite></a>)</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Winesburg, Ohio: A Modernist Kluge</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">It is now a matter of fact that the nonlinear, nonhierarchical, and delocalized
          functioning of the network has transformed the ways that many individuals define
          themselves, establish themselves in relationships, situate themselves in and apart from
          communities, and accumulate knowledge about what can be known in and about the world.
          While today’s most pervasive network — the Internet — facilitates posthumanist
          demonstrations of the power of ameliorative, (according to theorists Barry Wellman and
          William J. Mitchell), connectivity, the Internet and the virtual identities and
          communities it fosters also facilitate far more complex and ambivalent
          connections.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32722e107">[1]</a> Perhaps unsurprisingly, pundits and journalists
          have been largely responsible for warning against the network’s potentially negative and
          even harmful effects. While members of the media increasingly focus on the Internet’s
          detrimental impact and point to social networking platforms for evidence of the shallow
          and ultimately false promise of community that networks extend to users, Twitter and
          Facebook are only the most recent manifestations of the network’s long tradition of
          fostering users’ inner alienation while enabling their unprecedented connection.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Rather than proceeding <em class="term">in media res</em> and looking to the Internet to
          understand networks and to comprehend the dynamics of network culture, I take my cue from
          N. Katherine Hayles and look to literature. Apparently antithetical to the culture of the
          blurb, literature reveals "the complex cultural, social, and representation issues tied up
              with conceptual shifts and technological innovations" [<a class="ref" href="#hayles1999">Hayles 1999</a>, 24]. Its representational capabilities stem in part from its own status as an evolving
          technology, a point explicitly demonstrated by the continued publication of electronic
          texts and hypertexts and implicitly demonstrated by William Powers in his recent
          bestseller, <cite class="title italic">Hamlet’s Blackberry</cite>. Literary forms illustrate
          technology’s varied promises to and pitfalls for individuals and the communities to which
          they do and do not belong, but so too does literary content. In science fiction, for
          example, technology often leads to the "cognitive estrangement" that
          results in the fragmentation of individuals and the disintegration of their tenuous
          relationships to one another [<a class="ref" href="#suvin1972">Suvin 1972</a>, 372]. Similarly, "systems novels" generally
          display technology’s propensity to abet its own out-of control proliferation [<a class="ref" href="#mchale2006">McHale 2006</a>, 175]. Ultimately,
          literature’s dependence on and representations of technology and technology’s effects on
          its users make it an ideal medium through which to investigate what network theorists
          Shaviro and Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker describe as the antagonistic quality of
          the network’s rhizomatic structure.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">While it cannot be considered a work of science fiction, a systems novel, or even a text
          straightforwardly concerned with technology, Sherwood Anderson’s modernist pastoral <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> uses the story cycle form to offer an illustration
          of the ambivalent future technology promises. Although seldom considered a contribution to
          any modern comprehension of electronically inflected networks, the text, published in
          1919, features a town poised at a technological divide: its inhabitants look back to their
          agrarian past in which relationships were dependent on proximity and information was
          disseminated by storytelling, but they also look to the specter of the future where
          relationships are more arbitrary and excessive information is routed along the information
          superhighway. The town and townspeople, denied the connections of the past but unable to
          convene as a community of the future, form instead the tenuous connections based on the
          delocalized organization of a nascent network. Unlike today’s seamlessly embedded
          networks, however, the network in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> serves as a
          stopgap measure; it arises from out of an explicitly liminal space and can only awkwardly
          connect the text’s grotesque forms and deformed bodies. Rather than hailing what will
          serve as the network’s 21st-century iteration, <cite class="title italic">Winesburg,
            Ohio</cite> warns against the network, suggesting that while it may offer the only
          means by which a community can be connected, that community is not only monstrous and
          deformed, but functions as a trap.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Accordingly, although Galloway and Thacker claim that the
            "the idea of connectivity […] so highly privileged today"
           has "only recently attained any level of authority as a dominant diagram
              for mass social organization and control" [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2007">Galloway &amp; Thacker 2007</a>, 26, 15], <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> suggests that the network loomed
          large in modernists’ imaginations. Because the model of community that traverses the
          technological breach in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> is characterized by
          its awkwardness and lack of refinement, however, the term "network" may
          be a misleading descriptor. A network cannot help but assume the craftsmanship necessary
          to producing a "work of net", and in Anderson’s work, manual
          craftsmanship is relegated to that pre-technological past that Winesburg and its denizens
          no longer inhabit. Accordingly, that community, which exists in the space between the
          past’s emphasis on manual craftsmanship and the future’s emphasis on communicative
          technology, depicts an incipient, not yet fully formed network that might be better termed
          a "kluge," an awkward but effective makeshift device that precedes
          technical progression. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Although Gary Marcus, in <cite class="title italic">Kluge: the Haphazard Evolution of the Human
            Mind</cite>, has recently revived the concept of the kluge as a helpful metaphor for
          the "inelegant — but surprisingly effective" [<a class="ref" href="#marcus2008">Marcus 2008</a>, ] solutions to the problems constantly encountered by the human mind, the kluge’s
          contemporary meaning is rooted in early computer jargon. J.W. Granholm's parodic guide for
          "computer hardware men" in the 1962 publication of <cite class="title italic">Datamation</cite> popularized the term kluge (or
          "kludge") as a word that "stands ready...220 VAC
            source.""One of the most beloved words in design
          terminology," a kluge is an inelegant bricolage, a transitional tool comprised of
          an "ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts."  It
          works, but its unnatural shape and aberrant arrangements "form a
          distressing whole" that constantly calls attention to its awkward construction
          and its unlikely usefulness, and likely temporary usefulness [<a class="ref" href="#granholm1962">Granholm 1962</a>, 30–32].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Because kluges — effective and progressive but distressing and ugly — belong to the
          lexicon and job requirement of computer hardware men, they underscore the early and
          anticipatory efforts towards the interconnection and delocalization that characterize
          information systems and models of interconnection and organization. Kluges are especially
          relevant to network technology: indeed, in "the lashing together of whole modules of equipment […] the
              opportunity for applied kludgemanship presents itself to the hilt" [<a class="ref" href="#granholm1962">Granholm 1962</a>]. In part because "the lashing together of whole modules of equipment" [<a class="ref" href="#granholm1962">Granholm 1962</a>] aptly describes Anderson’s take on the story cycle form, the kluge provides an
          important emblem for <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite>. The term calls
          attention to the transitional and intermediary nature of the vision of community imagined
          in Anderson’s text, but it also supplies a technologically relevant context for
          understanding why the progression towards the networked future can be considered
          monstrous.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Published before "kludge" or even "network" became
          a crucial part of computer glossaries, <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> was
          nonetheless considered by many of its early readers to be a distressing collection of
          interconnected but ill-assorted parts. Its modernist version of the short story cycle
          garnered unfavorable reviews claiming that it was disjointed, that it violated the
          pastoral it appeared to represent, and that it described too vividly the immoral lives of
          America’s provincials. Heywood Broun of the <cite class="title italic">New York Tribune</cite>,
          for example, argued that Anderson’s work was marred by his apparent obsession with
          neurotics, and an anonymous reviewer for the <cite class="title italic">New York World</cite>
          hoped that Anderson "would one day learn to censor his unnecessarily ugly
              stories" [<a class="ref" href="#broun1919">Broun 1919</a>]. Despite such pans, positive reviews welcomed the text as innovative. According to
          these critics, Anderson’s text ushered in a new era for the short story via the new, or
          newly recycled, form of interrelated stories. Writing for <cite class="title italic">The New
            Republic</cite>, M.A. called <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> a "challenge to the snappy short story form, with its planned
              proportions of flippant philosophy, epigrammatic conversation and sex danger" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersonm1919">#andersonm1919</a></span>,<a class="noteRef" href="#d32722e253">[2]</a> and H.L Mencken claimed that the
          work offered 
            "a new order of short story," something "<cite class="title italic">The
                Spoon River Anthology</cite> aimed at, and missed by half a mile" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersonm1919">#andersonm1919</a></span>
          .</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">According to its supportive readers, the ill-assorted parts of <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> were particularly appropriate to narrating modernity’s
          influence on America’s post-industrial small towns. These readers implicitly recognized
          the discontinuity that characterized the twentieth-century’s bifurcated landscape between
          rural and urban America and understood that the story cycle, once a tool used to unify
          disparate poems or tales, could also be used to underscore difference. The story cycle,
          unlike traditional novels, lashes together disconnected and often discordant stories to
          capture what Llewellyn Jones describes in reference to Anderson’s work the "significant episode[s]" [<a class="ref" href="#jones1919">Jones 1919</a>] that characterize twentieth-century rural America. Indeed, consequent to Jones’s
          description and the widespread influence of <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite>,
          the short story cycle came to be accepted as an appropriate means by which to chronicle
          the episodic and seemingly increasingly discontinuous lives of small-town America.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Although Anderson’s text’s contribution to the story cycle’s modernist resurgence can be
          gauged in part by the story cycles that followed in its wake,<a class="noteRef" href="#d32722e282">[3]</a> the text’s mixed
          reviews and its readers’ reactions to the "grotesque" figures at the
          center of its stories have made the text’s lasting significance (and most all of Sherwood
          Anderson’s other works) a matter of debate.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32722e294">[4]</a> Today, however, critics such as Robert Dunne, citing the text’s modernist
          revision of a traditional form, seek to redeem Anderson’s work from its increasingly "minor […] place within the American canon" [<a class="ref" href="#dunne2005">Dunne 2005</a>]. Referencing Robert Spiller’s <cite class="title italic">Literary History of the United
            States</cite>, Dunne claims that Winesburg, Ohio deserves deeper and more complex
          contemporary interpretations because Anderson "‘liberat[ed] the American short story from a petrifying
              technique’" [<a class="ref" href="#dunne2005">Dunne 2005</a>, xiv].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Contemporary interest in the text’s emancipatory version of the story cycle, although
          calling for renewed attention to Anderson’s text, overlooks its kinship to a kluge. While
          the story cycle form is rooted in ancient storytelling tradition and emphasizes unity
          achieved through "structure, movement, and thematic development" [<a class="ref" href="#nagel2001">Nagel 2001</a>, 2], <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> emphasizes instead the labor by which
          such unity is forged [<a class="ref" href="#nagel2001">Nagel 2001</a>, 2]. Accordingly, because Winesburg,
          irrelevant to the "roaring, word-ridden cities" [<a class="ref" href="#love2008">Love 2008</a>, 39] after the "revolution [of] industrialism" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span>, can no longer function as a unifying force, a narrator and his young counterpart,
          George Willard, bear the sole responsibility of assembling Winesburg’s grotesques,
          alienated from themselves and isolated from each other, into a connected and temporarily
          cohesive community.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32722e339">[5]</a> The narrator and Willard’s work to narrate and therefore connect the
          grotesques’ heterogeneous stories results in a community characterized not by continuity
          but by fragmentariness, not by cohesion but by disparity.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32722e347">[6]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11"><cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> provides a model of affiliating disconnect individuals who, in an increasingly urban, information-oriented environment, are no longer linked by meaningfully sharing a geographic space or by participating in shared labor with one another. The text therefore merits the contemporary
          critical attention for which Dunne calls, but such attention should focus on the ways in
          which the text’s modernist version of the story cycle anticipates the delocalized and
          therefore highly structured interconnections facilitated by a network. In situating
          Winesburg as less a meaningful geographic space and more a potential hub able to connect
          isolated nodes, the text envisions the social group that can be made to materialize after

          follows Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's identification of the network's rhizomatic,
          non-centralized, and non-territorialized function, networks and information systems
          promote the "search for new connectedness around shared, reconstructed

Notwithstanding the narrator and Willard's facilitative roles, the characters designated as grotesque in Notwithstanding the narrator and Willard’s facilitative roles, the
          characters designated as grotesque in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> search
          for connectedness but are not able to overcome their marginalization and isolation. These
          characters, interpolated into a new system of organization but unable to progress or
          develop there, are barred from the "liberation rhetoric of distributed
            networks" and thereby suggest that incorporeal connections and reconstructed
          identities offer instead superficial and fragmentary cohesion [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2007">Galloway &amp; Thacker 2007</a>, 16]. Although they cannot help but signify an underlying unity, the grotesques
          are connected by their condition: the nodes of Winesburg’s network — what constitutes its
          vision of future community — underscore the etymological root of nodus that includes
            "tumor or swelling" among its meanings. Distinguished by
            "distortion", "unnatural combinations" (much like
          the kluge to which they refer), and excess, the grotesques suggest that in the modernist
          iteration of the network, infection is endemic to the network itself [<a class="ref" href="#oed">OED</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d32722e392">[7]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">While the grotesques personify the unnatural combinations that characterize the text’s

          Introduced by the narrator in the prologue, "The Book of the
            Grotesque," the grotesque figures appeared first to an old writer in a "dream that was not a dream" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span>. The vision, which was prompted by the old writer’s conversation with an old
          carpenter who had attempted to fix the writer’s bed, inspired the writer to write a book
          called "The Book of the Grotesque." The narrator claims that
          the book was never published, but that he
            "saw it once", and its
            "simple statement" 
           made an

          statement, mankind makes truths, but when men and women take up these truths, take them
          for the Truth, and try to live their lives by them, the truths become false and the men
          and women become grotesques.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">In the stories that follow "The Book of the Grotesque," the
          grotesques that appeared to the old writer emerge as Winesburg’s denizens. Although they

In his 1960 introduction to Anderson’s text,
          Malcolm Cowley argues that the deformation suffered by the grotesques proceeds from a
          quintessentially modern condition: alienated and isolated by the forces of
          post-industrialism, the grotesques cultivate obsessions they mistake for truth and grow
          increasingly deformed by their inability to "express themselves" [<a class="ref" href="#cowley1960">Cowley 1960</a>, 367] or "truly communicate with others" [<a class="ref" href="#cowley1960">Cowley 1960</a>, 367]. Dependent on constructed connections, their communicative disability indicates why
          they need the narrator and Willard to relate (and thereby make meaningful) what Jones
          calls the significant episodes and what David Bordwell calls the "attenuated links" [<a class="ref" href="#bordwell2006">Bordwell 2006</a>] that characterize every network narrative [<a class="ref" href="#bordwell2006">Bordwell 2006</a>, 99].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">According to Cowley’s reading of Anderson’s text, social groups formed by individuals’
          tenuous links to a mutual alienation or a common claim to a defunct geographic space have
          little to say that can be meaningfully said. While the modernist iteration of the
          network’s delocalized and hyperlinked form may facilitate connectivity and ensure
          unprecedented access to information, that connectivity cannot overcome "the innocence and horror of modernity [and the] subsequent

          technology, and information do not enable the (implicitly more valuable) kind of communication

          pointing out that seventeen years after the publication of Anderson’s text, the same
          information saturation and degradation of meaningful communication functions as the
          subject of Walter Benjamin’s essay "The Storyteller". In his
          work, Benjamin describes the process by which “secular productive forces of history”
          outstripped communities that were once defined and held together by the communicable
          experiences of storytellers and the symbiotic relationship between storytellers and
          craftsmen. According to Benjamin, the forces of history contributed to the proliferation
          of information, and because information
            "does not survive the moment in which it was new", it functions as an insidious
            "form of communication" that 
            "confronts" traditional communities "in a more menacing way" [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2002">Benjamin 2002</a>, 146–8].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17"><cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite>, which separates the past’s meaningful
          communication from the future’s excessive information, anticipates and illustrates
          Benjamin’s analysis. The narrator and Willard, by mediating the grotesques’ modern
          condition, help to provide this illustration. Together, they cast a Janus face over the
          text’s divide: the narrator looks longingly back to a time before the "coming of industrialism" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span>, while Willard looks optimistically forward <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span>. Illustrating Benjamin’s trajectory, the narrator’s voice begins <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite>. Because, however, he — like the grotesques — cannot
          accommodate the information age he describes, he cedes his storytelling role to Willard.
          As Winesburg’s young journalist, Willard represents the future. Because he looks forward
          to the realization of his dream of becoming an urban reporter, it is the story of his
          departure from Winesburg that ends Anderson’s text.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Although the entirety of <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> narrates the shift

          that shift is most conspicuous. There, the typological relationship (or
            "mythopoetic", in Benjamin Spencer’s words) between the storyteller

When he refers to Winesburg as "our town" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span>, he reveals that he, like the grotesques he describes, remains figuratively trapped
          in Winesburg. Additionally, and according to his own account, the narrator also suffers
          from a communicative disability: he is unable to interpret the "art of storytelling" [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2002">Benjamin 2002</a>, 143] into anything approximating a master craft. Although the narrator claims in "Hands", the first story following the prologue, that "[t]he story […] is a job for a poet," <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span> he emphasizes his inadequacy to the task: "Perhaps our talking of [the hands] will arouse the poet who will

          storyteller that follows from the emergence of information as a major mode of
          communication, the narrator is crippled in his effort to link Winesburg to the mode of
          communication he works to illustrate. George Willard, however, offers an antithesis. His
          job as Winesburg’s newspaperman makes him the recorder of the town’s significant episodes

          or a poet; he is instead the urban reporter and city newspaperman that Willard makes the
          object of his ambition. Willard prepares himself for his future career as a journalist by
          meeting Winesburg Eagle’s "one policy," <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span> to "mention by name in each issue, as many as possible of the

          a symbol of the development and subsequent liberation of the artist who unifies the text’s
          poorly matching parts, he is actually only the collector and implicit circulator of the
          grotesques’ stories.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32722e658">[10]</a>
          Unsurprisingly, however, this enables Willard to function as a more useful hub than the
          town itself. Through his work, he ensures that as long as the Winesburg Eagle provides a
          log of the town’s denizens, the grotesques cohere, even if only nominally, into a social
          group and community. Consequently, Edwin Fussell’s argument that Willard can only
            "expose [the grotesques] as they really are"
           because he can 
            "joi[n] sympathy and understanding to detachment and
              imperturbability"
           describes Willard not as the artist Fussell supposes, but as the reporter and
          journalist who does not
            "<em class="emph">live</em> the common passion,"

          undertaken to "meet the adventure of life," <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span> turns on his hope of "get[ting] work on a city newspaper" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span>. In the urban environment Willard makes his goal, the civic journalist has replaced
          the inadequate storyteller, the failed poet, and the inept craftsman. The journalist,

          which Benjamin suggests is, like the newspaper that features it, imminently disposable.
          Constantly expending the moment in which it was new because it demands superfluous "explanation," [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2002">Benjamin 2002</a>, 147] information obstructs and therefore threatens the value of meaning. Put another
          way, information, inherently excessive and therefore expendable, disrupts meaningful
          communication by necessitating explanation, clarification, and commentary. While Willard’s
          career aspirations adapt him to this proliferation, the narrator bemoans industrialism’s

          Kiesler describe as the network’s "free exchange of
            information," a forum that both enables and requires discourse and debate.
          Willard, in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite>, is suited to participate in this
          polyvocality: when he adheres to his newspaper’s one policy — recording as many names as
          possible in each newspaper’s issue — he gestures towards his aptitude for making the
          otherwise isolated grotesques assemble into a discourse rendered temporarily meaningful by
          the newspaper’s intermediary record. Notwithstanding Bakhtin's salutary description, however, the early analogue for the network represented by newspapers in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> offers another instance of a
          kluge. Indeed, aside from Willard and the names he writes on its pages, no other character
          in Anderson’s text appears to contribute to or read the newspaper. <cite class="title italic">The Winesburg Eagle</cite> does not, therefore, provide a forum for the discourse and
          debate that strengthens interlocutors’ connections; instead, it characterizes the
          connectivity assigned by Anderson to a nascent network by its inability to assemble
          fragmented and otherwise monstrous or distorted individuals into anything more than a
          transitory community. The paper’s apparent departure along with Willard not only suggests
          its transformation into the city newspaper for which Willard hopes to work, but it also

          pocket to record the stories passed on by his sources, Willard accumulates only the
          information that enables him to adhere to his paper’s superficial policy. More
          emphatically, in "Paper Pills", the second story following the
          prologue, papers signify the disposability of information and the disarticulation of
          meanings from stories. In "Paper Pills", Dr. Reefy writes
          "ends of thoughts, beginnings of thoughts" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span> on scraps of paper

          only in these needless papers, but also in the needless appendages attached to the
          grotesques’ bodies. As indicated above, because it claims among its many meanings both 
            "distortion"

          as such by a corporeal mutation that indicates their collective inability to adapt to
          technological progression. The superfluity of hands in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg,

          however, given the community’s distance from its traditional agrarian past, few — if any —

            "Hands," the first story to follow the prologue, most

There, his fingers, "forever active, forever striving to conceal themselves in his

          Biddlebaum attempts and fails to express himself with hands that paradoxically express
          too much and too little to Willard. When, for example, they once "stole forth and lay on George Willard’s shoulders," <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#andersons1919">#andersons1919</a></span> Biddlebaum hurried home, and Willard resolved never to ask about the conspicuous

          distort Biddlebaum’s body and suggest that those appendages, once an indispensable tool

          newspaper, for which it functions as precursor, and the activity hands occupy in the
          information-centric future of a post-industrial America. He replaces the narrator’s
          self-proclaimed clumsy effort at poetry with an urban journalism that depends on the

          which newsworthy information springs.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">It is with this handiwork that Willard reenacts and reinterprets the grotesque’s

          pages and enable their reader to see the network of polyvocal babble on the page and
          therefore read the discordant conversations that constitute the community the newspaper
          obliquely represents. In this manner, while <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite>
          laments the disappearance of the craftsman’s skilled hands and the hands that work the
          soil in rural communities (as well as the corollary disappearance of the gestures that
          once augmented a story’s meaning), Willard’s hands act out an entirely new set of tactile
          activities. In fact, Willard’s hands assemble a kluge: while Anderson’s text indicates the
          newspaper offers a poor substitute for community, the newspaper to which Willard
          contributes does fill the void that traditional communities have left. Signifying a
          perhaps distressingly ugly technological progression, the newspaper also functions as the
          network’s early analogue: it anticipates the "physical
            experience" of the computer whereby the continual movement of fingers and hands
          extend not the ear (even the prosthetic ear Willard offers), as a poet or traditional
          storyteller would have it, but the eye [<a class="ref" href="#shaviro2003">Shaviro 2003</a>, 6–7].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">Its representation of the grotesques as both excessive and necessary to the future

          the information age, via the newspaper as an analogue of the network, and represents the
          accidentally-integrative role the urban journalist serves in the temporary communities he

          emphasizes the awkward transition from a pre-technological past, rich in tangible
          connections and endemic identity, to a hyper-connected, networked future. Accordingly, the
          grotesques upon which the text centers are the awkward and alienated casualties of the
          post-industrial rise of information that makes the networks to come both necessary and
          inevitable. While the network ultimately envisioned in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg,
            Ohio</cite> provides a stopgap measure that kluges together an unraveling community,
          the bandage affixed to the site of its communicative disease provides only temporary
          relief and does not enable restorative progression. Rather than celebrating the network’s
            "heroic tones" and "countercultural ideology"
          (despite its militaristic roots), the grotesques in <cite class="title italic">Winesburg,

          degradation of more meaningful communication [<a class="ref" href="#castells2004">Castells 2004</a>, 354].
          Consequently, while <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> suggests that the
          transition to the network as a dominant mode of contemporary organization is ugly, sick,
          and distressing, it also suggests that the transition is inevitable. An emblem of this
          transition, Willard transforms the old writer in "The Book of the
            Grotesque": carrying uncannily close at hand the fragments of Winesburg, Willard
          redefines the meaning of a viral journalist to indicate the diseased nodes and alienated
