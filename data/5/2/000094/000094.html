          (1930-36) to read its complex form — what the author once referred to as a "four-way conveyor system" — as an intricate networking scheme, and
          considers it as an archive of early network thinking. Contrary to traditional readings of
            <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> that discuss its formal properties in terms of
          dispersal and the supposedly ruinous disconnections of modern life, the paper argues that
          the interplay of these formal fragments results in a semiotic web that drives Dos Passos’s
          narrative strategy toward a totalizing vision of the nation and, indeed, history. Beal’s
          paper deals with the progressive widening of network figuration in American modernism to
          think the very politics of national space, and in focusing on the machinic dynamics of Dos
          Passos’s form, the article establishes network discourses as the organizing principle of
          several pre-digitization modes of production, including Fordism and the modern
          corporation.</p></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The literary history of John Dos Passos’s <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> trilogy is in
        some respects as epic as the work itself. Common, for example, is the position that Michael
        Denning takes on the trilogy’s troubled relationship with critics over the tumultuous period
        of late modernism: "To put it crudely, his move to the radical
            right lost him his left-wing admirers, while the undisputed sense that his early works
            are his finest made him a difficult icon for the right [….] Unlike many of his
            contemporaries, he did not move from a radical political art to an apolitical formalism,
            and thus never won the allegiance of formalist or aestheticist critics" [<a class="ref" href="#denning1997">Denning 1997</a>, 167]. This trajectory, however, does not fully
        account for a spike in interest in the author and the trilogy in the early 1980s: a 1980
          <cite class="title italic">Modern Fiction Studies</cite> special issue dedicated to <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>, Townsend Ludington’s sprawling biography of Dos Passos of
        the same year, and chapters in several books throughout the decade. Nor does it account for
        the late 1990s revival in Dos Passos scholarship — perhaps partly fueled by the 1996
        publication of a Library of America edition of the <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>
        trilogy — in which Denning himself is a key figure. Yet on the whole these remain as minor
        peaks of interest, and in American literary scholarship the <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> trilogy is not exactly gone, but is close to forgotten.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Whatever restoration the <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> trilogy has enjoyed at the
        turn of the century encourages its own historicization. For these 1980s and 1990s revivals
        of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> scholarship correspond to the advances in digital
        technology that have spawned not only the scholarly field of digital media studies, but have
        also led to the adoption of digital figurations across the humanities — especially in the
        powerful figure of the network. The network is, after all, the central figure of some of the
        most prominent works that have defined the theoretical production of the last thirty years
        or so, and that in various ways respond to technological developments that have forged the
        Information Age and the economic trends loosely associated under the omnibus term
        globalization. Of course it would be sloppy to argue for a causal relationship between the
        humanities’ turn toward network theory and the returns to <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> But the correspondence between these two developments raises important
        questions that could illuminate some of the trilogy’s formal complexity, as well as deepen
        our understanding of the relationship between modernism and networked discourses. What might
        one find if she were to look at the trilogy in terms of the network theory that has
        accompanied the renewed attention to it? Moreover, to what degree was network theory already
        present in the intellectual and literary production of Dos Passos’s milieu?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">This paper takes up these gaps in scholarship on <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s
        networked dynamics and, along with the other papers in this cluster, the importance of
        networks to American modernism. Dos Passos’s trilogy provides an exemplary case study in the
        moderns’ experiments with networks, because it uses network narration in its representation
        of early twentieth-century American history. Perhaps more than any other modernist work,
          <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> deploys the fundamentally modern trope of the fragment
        and simultaneously insists on a totalizing vision of its fragments. Accordingly, its form offers a framework that turn-of-the-century readers should recognize, if only implicitly, as a networked construction. For by insisting on the interrelationships
        of these textual fragments, Dos Passos transforms fragments to nodes on his totalizing
        network. Dos Passos’s conception of networks is the focus of this essay, which will study
        the trilogy’s formalist network logic and its intervention into characterological
        connectivity that place his conceptualization of the network as an early marker of the
        intellectual history of network theory — a history that begins well in advance of the
        digital revolution that has come to displace variants of network thinking that came before
        it. Dos Passos’s intervention into networked discourse, I argue, is that he uses networks to
        mediate his formal strategy of fragmentation and totalization as a model of historical
        study.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The thrust of the argument is not only aimed at registering the network dynamics of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>, but also at using the trilogy as a case study in the
        literary history of what has come to be called the "network narrative" genre. When
        recently the network narrative has come into play in genre studies, the result has tended to
        have a limiting effect that, while appropriate in the delimitation of generic boundaries,
        has too often excluded important modes of network narration — along both formal and
        historical lines. Film scholar David Bordwell, for example, restricts the network narrative
        genre to films structured around the six-degrees-of-separation theorem such as Robert
        Altman’s <cite class="title italic">Nashville</cite> (1975) and <cite class="title italic">Short
          Cuts</cite> (1993), Michael Haneke’s <cite class="title italic">71 Fragments</cite> (1994), or
        Paul Haggis’s <cite class="title italic">Crash</cite> (2005). Offering but lip-service to texts
        like Thornton Wilder’s <cite class="title italic">Bridge of San Luis Rey</cite> (1927) and Vicki
        Baum’s <cite class="title italic">Shanghai ’37</cite> (1939), Bordwell defines the genre as
        comprised of those narratives in which "there are […] several
          protagonists, but their projects are largely decoupled from one another, or only
          contingently linked"[<a class="ref" href="#bordwell2008">Bordwell 2008</a>, 192]. And David Ciccoricco’s
        much more theoretically rigorous <cite class="title italic">Reading Network Fiction</cite> (2007)
        offers an altogether different vantage of the genre, framing it as the product of a digital
        environment. With studies in texts such as Michael Joyce’s <cite class="title italic">Twilight, A
          Symphony</cite> (1997), Ciccoricco studies the formal complexities of narrative when it
        operates in a truly hypertextual state. But both of these definitions of the genre make some
        crucial omissions that this paper will begin to amend — Bordwell confining the genre to the
        narrative of the six-degrees theorem, and Ciccoricco restricting it to a hyperlinked
        environment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">To define a genre is a terribly messy business that almost always entails amendment and
        revision, so I certainly empathize with Bordwell and Ciccoricco when I advance my
        formulation of the network narrative: simply that it mediates the dialectic of totalization
        and fragmentation with linking mechanisms that draw atomized nodal formations into a
        constellar system. This dialectical tension is especially significant in the case of Dos
        Passos and his contemporaries, as it may well constitute the cultural logic of modernism,
        given the technological, demographic, and ideational upheaval outlined in the introduction
        to this cluster of essays. Precisely what kind of network such a narrative might use as a
        narrational model is variable — networks of people, material or technological networks, and
        perhaps most relevant to Dos Passos’s modern milieu, networks of form itself, to name but a
        few possibilities. Of course this flexibility is at once the strength and the weakness of
        such a loose definition, and for my purposes it allows us to read the networked dynamics of
        modern texts that predate the dawn of hypertextual narratives that are but one set of the
        genre. This flexibility grants us a position to see that the network narrative is a
        twentieth-century phenomenon, but not an exclusively late twentieth-century phenomenon, as
        this study of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> attempts to demonstrate. Through a reading
        of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>, I contend that we can locate some crucial modes of
        network thinking in the aesthetics of modern narrative, and that these early forms of the
        network narrative can illuminate an overlooked period in the development of network theory. </div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">A "Four-Way Conveyor System"</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">That the fragment is a standard trope deployed by the moderns is a truism among scholars
          of modernisms. Likewise, the moderns’ investment in totalization has been established as
          an equally central element in modernist literature. These competing impulses — to
          represent a society breaking into pieces under the pressures of rapid social changes, and
          simultaneously to find a semblance of unity to guard against outright societal entropy —
          coincide in the form, as well as the content, of major works of high modernism. The
          fragment is not necessarily an indicator of a networked body, but very often networked
          figuration mediates the tension of these competing impulses as an important mechanism to
          bridge the gap between dispersal and unity that typifies the modernist aesthetic
          experiments in form. The <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> trilogy’s intervention into
          modernist fragmentation is especially noteworthy in its intensification of the formal
          experiments already seen in short story cycles like Sherwood Anderson’s <cite class="title italic">Winesburg, Ohio</cite> (1919) or in Jean Toomer’s collage of poetry,
          prose, and drama in <cite class="title italic">Cane</cite> (1923), to name just two of the most
          canonical examples. The architecture of Dos Passos’s narrative evokes the figure of the
          network as it circumscribes American history from 1900 up to the late 1920s. Thomas
          Ludington, the authoritative biographer of Dos Passos, explains that Dos Passos conceived
          of the trilogy as a "'series of reportages of the
              time'" in which he was "'trying to get something a little more accurate than fiction'" [<a class="ref" href="#ludington1980">Ludington 1980</a>, 256].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The distinction of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s fragmentation lies in its
          experimental technique of employing four discrete modes for this historical narrative. As
          Denning notes, Dos Passos referred to the trilogy’s structure as a "four-way conveyor system" comprised of some sixty-eight Newsreels, fifty-one
          Camera Eyes, twenty-seven biographical sketches, and fictional narratives centered on
          twelve anchoring character-threads [<a class="ref" href="#denning1997">Denning 1997</a>, 170]. Denning argues
          convincingly that Dos Passos’s architectural narration was designed as "a series of formal solutions to the problem of building a novel that
              culminates in the magical unity of the title itself, <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>" [<a class="ref" href="#denning1997">Denning 1997</a>, 169]. And indeed, each component of this
          architecture seems to perform a specialized task in the service of that narration, a
          design that Denning argues reflects an "aesthetic
              Taylorism" [<a class="ref" href="#denning1997">Denning 1997</a>, 170]. The Newsreels offer newspaper copy,
          advertisements, and popular song lyrics to narrate the history and zeitgeist of the
          period. The Camera Eye, which scholars often recognize as a stream-of-consciousness
          rendering of Dos Passos’s own life, narrates the lived experience of the period — if a
          lived experience constrained to the author’s biography. The biographical sketches outline
          a punctuated history via great-man-of-history portraits of Woodrow Wilson, Eugene Debs,
          Andrew Carnegie, Thorstein Veblen, and the Wright Brothers, to name but a few of the
          figures whom Dos Passos explores alongside their interventions. The fictional component
          narrates the developments of the period through a matrix of characters experiencing
          different segments of the historical spectrum.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">It bears noting that this "four-way conveyor system" was quite controversial among
          early reviews of the trilogy’s volumes. Even to his contemporary readers, already
          accustomed to the moderns’ revolt against verisimilitude, Dos Passos’s four-way conveyor
          presented a challenge. Upton Sinclair’s review of <cite class="title italic">The 42nd
            Parallel</cite> for the <cite class="title italic">New Masses</cite>, though perhaps not
          quite representative given his commitment to social realism, lashed out at Dos Passos’s
          three non-fictional modes. Sinclair called the Newsreels "vaudeville
            material"; he said that the insofar as the biographical sketches were relatively
          short "we don’t mind them especially"; and he lamented that the
          Camera Eye passages bear no strong relation to the character-threads <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sinclair1930">#sinclair1930</a></span>. Espousing a common ambivalence toward the "four-way
            conveyor system," Matthew Josephson’s <cite class="title italic">Saturday Review</cite>
          piece on <cite class="title italic">1919</cite> treated the non-fictional modes as white noise,
          characterizing them as "a sort of vivid backdrop against which
              the characters pass in procession" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#josephson1932">#josephson1932</a></span>. And it is telling that the British
          publisher of <cite class="title italic">The 42nd Parallel</cite> wanted to eliminate altogether
          the Newsreels and Camera Eyes from their edition [<a class="ref" href="#ludington1980">Ludington 1980</a>, 287].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Against these critiques we can contrast Malcolm Cowley’s <cite class="title italic">New
            Republic</cite> review of <cite class="title italic">The Big Money</cite>, which addresses
          the complete trilogy’s reliance on "technical devices" to make Dos Passos’s
          architecture of history cohere, and he treats each of the four narrative modes to show
          their unique contributions to the text [<a class="ref" href="#cowley1936">Cowley 1936</a>, 137–39]. Cowley
          even revisited that review a year later to argue that the Camera Eye segments perform the
          function of maintaining interiority that prevents <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> from
          being a mere "collective novel" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#cowley">#cowley</a></span>. Cowley’s persistent defense of Dos Passos’s
          non-fictional modes should indicate the extent to which the ambivalence of Josephson’s
          white-noise assessment prevailed among reviewers of the <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> trilogy, which seems to indicate critics’ bafflement at what common

          vision of the United States and of narration itself. Dos Passos de-centers the
          character-threads by introducing that element third, behind the first volleys of Newsreels
          and the Camera Eye that inaugurate <cite class="title italic">The 42nd Parallel</cite>. With
          the plot-driven narration marginalized from its usual position of authority, U.S.A.
          proceeds to locate its narration in the interstices of the four nodes that compose its
          vision of the United States.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The "conveyors" indeed cooperate as an assembly line to fill in the gaps left by the
          other nodes, and that analogy is perfectly appropriate for two reasons. First, each
          separate node unfolds in roughly chronological order, in the movement of a conveyor. For
          example, the Newsreels start with the dawn of the new century, cover the tumult of the war
          years, and move on to the first Florida land boom and other hallmarks of the Roaring 20s.
          And the other narrative nodes follow that trajectory, with the character-threads
          presenting minor exceptions in the movement between one dominant character and another
          that sometimes requires resetting history to get a character’s back-story. Second, the
            "conveyors" structure replicates Fordism’s strategy of subsegmentation. The general
          wisdom is that Fordism is characterized by linearity and centralized control. The former
          holds, borne out in the rigid edicts of management that coordinated the production of the
          entire workplace, but the notion that Fordist production was a strictly linear affair
          simply does not obtain. The Fordist paradigm operates on the division of labor, where
          separate tasks are performed by separate workers on separate assembly lines. So a worker
          on the factory floor would not experience the production model as a linear process that
          oversees each unit from nascent part to salable whole, but as a network wherein different
          components were manufactured separately and contemporaneously only to be assembled at the
          last moment. That paradigm — a division of labor — is precisely the model of Dos Passos’s
          architecture: a division of narrational labor that assigns four modalities of
          representation to four distinct segments of narrative that move along as autonomous,
          interdependent conveyor belts. That Fordist interdependence of distinct narrative tasks
          sets up a constellar mode of production. In other words, the structure of the trilogy is
          that of a network comprised of four anchoring nodes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">We can see this networked narration on display in a sequence of each of the four
          modalities in <cite class="title italic">1919</cite>. The sequence addresses Armistice Day in
          each mode of narration. Joe Williams, whom we first met as he deserted the merchant marine
          in Buenos Aires, is in France when the news comes, and he enjoys the exuberant scene —
              "Everybody was dancing in the kitchen and they poured the
              cook so many drinks he passed out cold and they all sat there singing and drinking
              champagne out of tumblers and cheering the allied flags that girls kept carrying
              through" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1932">#dospassos1932</a></span> — partly with his
          trademark womanizing. Newsreel XXIX, which immediately follows the Joe Williams piece,
          conveys the objective history of the event with headlines reporting the actual signing of
          the Armistice as well as the riotous celebrations that accompanied it: "The arrival of the news caused the swamping of the city’s telephone
            lines"; "at the Custom House the crowd sang The Star Spangled
            Banner under the direction of Byron R. Newton the Collector of the Port"; "Oh say can you see by the dawn’s early light"; and so on <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1932">#dospassos1932</a></span>. The thirty-sixth Camera Eye relates the experience
          of the event: "Hay sojer tell me they’ve signed an armistice tell
              me the wars over they’re takin us home latrine talk the hell you say" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1932">#dospassos1932</a></span>. The biographical sketch at the end of
          this sequence is a portrait of Woodrow Wilson, and while the Armistice itself gets only
          glancing treatment — "Almost too soon the show was over" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1932">#dospassos1932</a></span> — the sketch neatly situates Wilson in
          the context of the empire building that followed the end of the war: alongside Clemenceau
          and Lloyd George, Wilson is one of "three old men shuffling the pack,
            / dealing out the cards" of imperial mapping <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1932">#dospassos1932</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Still, the sequence of the Armistice Day accounts is but one of the most literal examples
          of the networked narration that structures <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> The nodal
          formation of the four anchoring fragments does not always provide a concise examination of
          one punctual moment with such tight thematic clustering, oftentimes preferring a more
          diffuse, constellar narration of a wide-ranging development in the United States’ first
          decades of the new century.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">One of the more pronounced issues engaged across the breadth of the trilogy is the
          development of the public relations industry. The impact of public relations is
          demonstrated in the trajectory of the Newsreels across the trilogy. As Caren Irr shows,
          the arc of the Newsreels moves from news-related headlines to the "want ads, promotions of dancing lessons, celebrations of new auto parts" and
          other advertisements that dominate <cite class="title italic">The Big Money</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#irr1998">Irr 1998</a>, 53]. The Camera Eye follows this pattern, as brand
          recognition begins to enter the speaker’s subjectivity: "walk the
              streets and walk the streets inquiring of Coca-Cola signs Lucky Strike ads" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1936">#dospassos1936</a></span>. Curiously, Dos Passos’s biographical
          sketches do not feature a founder of the PR field — someone like Ivy Lee or Edward Bernays
          would not have been surprising — but some of the later sketches do bear the suggestion of
          PR’s influence. Henry Ford’s sketch, for example, opens with the glamorizing account by a
            "featurewriter" whose profile of the auto magnate is equal parts advertisement for
          Ford and for one of his automobile prototypes: "The machine
              certainly went with a dreamlike smoothness. There was none of the bumping common even
              to a streetcar" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1936">#dospassos1936</a></span>. Stabilizing those diffuse engagements
          with public relations in the non-fictional modes is an anchoring thematization of PR
          across the character-threads. The sketches of J. Ward Moorehouse, the father of PR in Dos
          Passos’s fictionalized America and one of many characters working in the field throughout
            <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>, are vital threads that establish the importance of
          PR in <cite class="title italic">The 42nd Parallel</cite>. And while his featured profiles
          expire with the first volume, Moorehouse has cameos in the profiles of Joe Williams and
          Dick Savage in <cite class="title italic">1919</cite> and of Charley Anderson and Dick Savage
          in <cite class="title italic">The Big Money</cite> — and these are but a few of the many
          characters who figure prominently in the PR industry.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">In both cases, the punctual event of Armistice Day and the development of public
          relations, Dos Passos’s strategy is a formal circumscription. His vision of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> is a composite of these fragmentary perspectives performed
          by the four narrative modes. But it is the cooperation, not the severance, of those
          fragments that is telling here. The four modes of narration in <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> are not merely perspectivism, as in Wallace Stevens’s famous "13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird," nor are they interchangeable or
          divisible vantage points from which to view American history. Rather, they cooperate as a
          network to reflect the very networking of that history. For instead of a diaspora of
          fragments performing abject disconnection, the structure of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> is a nodal one: one’s reading of the Camera Eye in isolation imperils an
          understanding of Dos Passos’s attempt at formal totalization. The formal logic of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> transforms the modernist aesthetic of fragmentation into a
          constellation of nodes, a network.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">In a way, <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s networked form has been obliquely
          observed in scholarly treatments of its likeness to montage, the buzzword that dominates
          the bulk of recent scholarship on the trilogy. I do not invoke "network" as a
          substitution term for "montage" — as if this were some kind of shell game of
          postmodernist and modernist lexicons; rather, each term illuminates the logic of the
          other. The montage analogy demonstrates some of the burgeoning recognition of Dos Passos’s
          networked dynamics, and it is no accident that scholars have traditionally recognized Dos
          Passos’s debt to film. As is routinely observed, Dos Passos’s Newsreels are reminiscent of
          the newsreels edited by Russian filmmaker Dziga Vertov in the <cite class="title italic">Kino-Pravda</cite> series (1922-25), and in naming one of his narrative modes The
          Camera Eye, Dos Passos invokes Vertov’s <em class="term">kino-eye</em>, an avant-garde philosophy of
          montage performed in <cite class="title italic">Man with a Movie Camera</cite> (1929). David
          Kadlec observes that by the mid-thirties Dos Passos’s debt to Vertov was an open secret
          and that Vertov was proud to be known for influencing Dos Passos [<a class="ref" href="#kadlec2004">Kadlec 2004</a>, 307]. Kadlec notes that many critics establish Dos Passos’s debt to Vertov in his
          1928 tour of Moscow and Leningrad, when he attended some of Vertov’s screenings, which he
          preferred to "the grander, state-backed productions of [Sergei]
              Eisenstien and Vsevolod Pudovkin" [<a class="ref" href="#kadlec2004">Kadlec 2004</a>, 307].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Montage remains a mainstay of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> criticism — so much so
          that many scholars seem to feel compelled to integrate it into their arguments or argue
          against it when addressing Dos Passos’s formal invention. Celia Tichi, for example,
          grapples with that tradition when arguing for the form’s function as a machine:
              "The filmic montage is a figure that does not go far enough
              to capture the full sense of Dos Passos’s innovation [….] Though Dos Passos identified
              his fiction with film and cinema and called his own writing an intrinsically
              satisfying craft, his omniscient fictional form comes from the contemporary model of
              machine and structural technology" [<a class="ref" href="#tichi1987">Tichi 1987</a>, 216]. Irr, writing about the collisions that
          underlie <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s performance of social speed, also obliges
          the issue of montage, observing the many literal collisions in the narrative — of cars,
          airplanes, and so on — before noting the logic of collision at the formal level: Dos
          Passos "constructs montages whose organizing principle is the
              collision between these equally inadequate modes of writing" [<a class="ref" href="#irr1998">Irr 1998</a>, 64].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">The aesthetics of montage are a foundational scholarly force to be reckoned with, as
          Tichi, Irr and a host of other Dos Passos scholars can attest. Framing the trilogy in
          terms of montage provides a helpful visual analogy for the text and rightly asserts Dos
          Passos’s debt to film, but it does not fully engage the logic of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s form. Instead, what many readers understand as <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s appropriation of montage techniques would be better viewed within the
          frame of the network. In the montage experiments of modern film and even the photography
          and advertisements that experimented with the new technology of the half-tone press in the
            1880s,<a class="noteRef" href="#d37764e478">[1]</a> old
          meanings are overturned and new meanings are produced by different techniques — sequential
          revolutions, overlays, split images, mirrored images, and so on. The productive capacity
          of montage, according to traditional scholarship on this practice, lies in the collisions
          it creates, in the violent contrast of juxtaposed images. And this is the force of montage
          for Irr, who reads the four narrative modes as operating on an organizational principle of
          collision.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">A networked reading of montage, however, focuses not on the collisions, but on the
          collaborative moments the technique facilitates. Such collaboration is, after all, evoked
          in the Fordist metaphor of the "four-way conveyor system." The four modes of
          narration are distinct, to be sure, but they produce meaning in their collaborative — not
          colliding or disjunctural — narration of history, as in the networked narration of
          Armistice Day and other developments and events that fall under the trilogy’s scope.
          Accordingly, Dos Passos’s narrative system performs Fordist subsegmentation, producing
          meaning not by violent juxtaposition but by the cooperation of separate functions that are
          simultaneously isolated and integrated, nodal and networked. Denning argues that Dos
          Passos’s "four-way conveyor system" is an "aesthetic
            Taylorism" that may be as much a symptom as it is a critique of rationalized
          labor [<a class="ref" href="#denning1997">Denning 1997</a>, 170]. But the analogy of Fordism better
          illuminates our understanding of the trilogy’s formal interplay: if we view this narrative
          architecture in terms of its emphasis on compartmentalized production instead of its
          reputation for demanding efficiency, then Fordist subsegmentation comes to the fore and we
          can understand how the four narrative modes cooperate.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">The Fordist element of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s formal network schemes bears
          further consideration, since it aligns the trilogy with an early mode of network
          theorization. As I argued earlier, Fordism emphasizes centralized management at the same
          time that its actual production strategy relies on networked simultaneity. So Dos Passos’s
          characterization of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> as a "four-way conveyor
            system" invokes Fordism’s important principle of modern network formulation. And
          while the networks of Fordism are rigid and hierarchical compared to the truly distributed
          networks of post-Fordist production strategies and economic systems, it is still important
          to register how Fordism prefigured a networked model of production in the simultaneity of
          its subsegmentation. That such a model also drives the formal structure of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> only reinforces that modern context in which the
          ideological and ideational force of the network was developing — a trend reflected in the
          Fordist networking of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> itself.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21"><cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s narration has the multi-dimensional force of
          montage, but the logic of its productive capacity is fundamentally different from the
          theories and practices of montage that rely on collision. Disjunctural montage and
          networked montage both operate on a constellar model, but networked montage has the
          separate goal of totalization — a goal that is announced in the very title of Dos Passos’s
          trilogy. And this networked montage may be a uniquely American intervention. Christopher
          Phillips argues that, in contrast to the European and Russian experiments with montage, by
          the late 1930s in the United States, "montage was more and more
              recognized not as a means to evoke the flux and discontinuity of the modern world, but
              as a way to represent a dominant social theme in late-Depression America: the idea of
              the 'unity in diversity' of all classes and ethnic groups" [<a class="ref" href="#phillips1992">Phillips 1992</a>, 35]. Phillips responds to American trends in
          the visual arts, but Dos Passos’s interventions into montage follow the same path,
          emphasizing the networked interdependence of the separate narrative modes instead of their
          dispersal.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Far from some anachronistic misapplication of a contemporary buzzword or catchphrase, a
          networked reading of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> helpfully demonstrates Dos
          Passos’s formal logic and allows us to recognize the points of connection between the
          trilogy’s four narrative modes. It is no longer sufficient to observe that Dos Passos’s
          representational strategy of the "four-way conveyor system" fits neatly into one of
          the now-standard narratives for modernism — that the moderns’ revolt against
          verisimilitude was necessitated by rapid social changes that demanded radically new means
          of representation — or simply that it borrows montage techniques from avant-garde film.
          Instead, in light of the rise of network theory in the late 1900s, we must begin
          fitting <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> into a narrative for the rise of the network
          as the dominant figure of a literary history and an intellectual history for the American
          twentieth century.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head"><cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>: The United Six-Degrees of America</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">Next to his radical formal innovation with the "four-way conveyor system," the
          interconnectivity of Dos Passos’s content may seem tame. Not only had the
          characterological, six-degrees-of-separation mode of networking already been explored by others,
          but Dos Passos himself had experimented with it in <cite class="title italic">Manhattan
            Transfer</cite>, his sprawling ode to New York City published in 1925. Ludington
          reminds us that in many ways, the fictional element of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s "reportages of the time" remained at the core of Dos Passos’s
          vision: the trilogy would be "not a novel, but a series covering
              a lengthy period, 'in which characters appeared and
                reappeared'" [<a class="ref" href="#ludington1980">Ludington 1980</a>, 256]. Indeed, if one node of the narrative
          structure weighed just a bit more than others for Dos Passos, it would be the character
          threads: "Despite incorporating nonfiction, his ultimate aim 'was always to produce fiction,' and he thought himself 'sort of on the edge between them, moving from one field to the other
              very rapidly.' The series of reportages was to be 'a
              contemporary commentary on history’s changes, always as seen by some individual’s
              ears, felt by some individual’s nerves and tissues'"[<a class="ref" href="#ludington1980">Ludington 1980</a>, 256].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">And so architectural networking of the form is matched in the networking of the fictional
          content, with individual characters refracting the developments of Dos Passos’s
            "reportages." In this respect, the fictional characters serve as secondary nodes
          under the primary nodal construction of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s form,
          providing a comfortable fictional body through which the historical and social
          developments resonate. In <cite class="title italic">The 42nd Parallel</cite>, J. Ward
          Moorehouse is the figural manifestation of the developments in public relations, as we saw
          above, and several others like G.H. Barrow and Dick Savage carry that banner throughout
          the remainder of the trilogy. Joe Williams figures the tumultuous war years in <cite class="title italic">1919</cite>, and Ben Compton does the same for labor movements during
          that period. Charley Anderson and Margo Dowling figure the "roar" of the debt-fueled
          Roaring Twenties throughout <cite class="title italic">The Big Money</cite>. And the other key
          character-threads generally perform the same function, reinforcing the reportages’
          historical commentary with a handy synechdochal figuration of the major developments in
          American history. And so the individual characters act as another system of nodes that
          support the four-way conveyor system’s networked narration of American history.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">It is also notable that within the fictional narrative mode, the individual characters
          are nodally connected to each other — not just to the broader networking schemes of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s formal approach to narration. Dos Passos’s goal of a
          trilogy traversing a wide span of time "in which characters appeared
            and reappeared" means that <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> takes a narrative
          structure that is increasingly common in contemporary narrative production: the
          six-degrees theorem. Under the totalizing network of vast schemes of American history
          performed by the "four-way conveyor system" lies this second network of crisscrossing
          characters.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">But for many scholars these characters’ relationships remain a jumble of disconnection.
          Michael Denning, for example, writes that the organizing principle of the fictional
          narration is disaggregation — a critique that was common among the trilogy’s contemporary
          reviewers: <blockquote><p>Perhaps the most striking thing and unsettling aspect
            of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> is the lack of any coherent connection between the characters: no family or
              set of families constitutes the world of the novel; no town, no neighborhood, or city
              serves as a knowable community; no industry of business, no university or film colony
              unites public and private lives; and no plot, murder, or inheritance links the
              separate destinies. [<a class="ref" href="#denning1997">Denning 1997</a>, 182]</p></blockquote> And for that reason, Denning concludes that
          the fundamental social unit of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> is a cocktail party, a
          function that, he notes, marks the climax of each of the three volumes. The cocktail
          party, he writes, "stands as a substitute for narratives of home
              and family, an alternative to the domestic space that usually organizes the novel [….]

          admirable, given the profile of literal cocktail parties in the culmination of each volume
          and in the aura of socialite Eveline Hutchins, and given the figurative cocktail party of
            "ill assorted people" — to use one of Hutchins’s phrases —
          who have but little in common throughout the trilogy <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1936">#dospassos1936</a></span>. And it is a reading to which I am sympathetic, as it serviceably addresses
          the lack of organic connections throughout the trilogy. But Denning’s reading does not go
          far enough in explaining the logic of the characters’ connections. To impose such a "substitute for narratives of home and family" to organize the
          fictional characters of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> is a false projection of a
          traditionally ordered narrative. Instead, making sense of that disaggregation on its own
          terms is precisely the demand placed on readers by this narrative.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">Denning’s discomfort with the erosion of traditional mechanisms of social organization —
          family, community, work, etc. — speaks to the very dispersal that Dos Passos tries to
          capture, and simultaneously to balance with the formal ligatures of the characters’
          interconnections. It is, in other words, a marker of one side of the cultural logic of
          modernism: an intense concern over entropic disaggregation that many moderns feared to be
          threatening the coherence of nation, community, and culture. To see the networked
          mediation of these dialectical polarities — fragment and totality, dispersal and unity —
          let us consider the case of one of the trilogy’s most colorful characters, Doc Bingham.
          Never does Bingham enjoy the spotlight of a chapter titled after his name; instead, we
          only see him through the character-threads "Mac" in <cite class="title italic">The 42nd
            Parallel</cite> and "Richard Ellsworth Savage" in <cite class="title italic">The Big
            Money</cite>. His appearance alongside Fenian "Mac" McCreary is brief, but
          memorable. Mac answers a want-ad listed for The Truthseeker Literary Distributing Co.,
          Inc. by Emmanuel R. Bingham, D.D. They travel the countryside, posing as purveyors of
          moral pamphlets but are quick to advertise other, less pious wares: Bingham stocks such
          scandalous tracts as <cite class="title italic">The Queen of the White Slaves</cite> and tells
          one mark, "We have a number of very interesting books stating the
              facts of life frankly and freely, describing the deplorable licentiousness of life in
              the big cities, ranging from a dollar to five dollars. The Complete Sexology of Dr.
              Burnside, is six fifty" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1930">#dospassos1930</a></span>. The con is up, however, when Bingham is
          caught in bed with a patron’s wife and abandons Mac to fend for himself. He does not
          resurface until deep into <cite class="title italic">The Big Money</cite>, when Dick Savage is
          assigned to handle a public relations account for Bingham, now going by "E.R.
            Bingham," whose latest scam involves alternative medication and diets — regimes we
          might label "new age" today. Again, the appearance is fleeting. Bingham, the advocate
          of clean living, convinces Savage to escort him around some of the city’s seedy sex
          districts and eventually grants him the account. His only subsequent appearance in the
          text is indirect, as Savage and the Moorehouse PR firm lobby food legislation on his
          behalf and arrange favorable publicity on radio and newsreels — though not, I should
          clarify, the Newsreels of the complementary narrative mode.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">In many ways, Bingham’s reemergence is completely frivolous — the kind of detail common
          in six-degrees narratives that, for some, smacks of contrivance. And it is true: Bingham
          is unnecessary to demonstrate Savage’s loyalty to the Moorehouse firm and the degradation
          to which he falls, which one might assume are Dos Passos’s primary goals in dragging
          Savage through strip clubs and Bingham’s incessant claptrap. But if the frequency of such
          tangential crisscrossing is any indication, the network of relationships — Mac to Bingham
          to Savage to Moorehouse to Charley Anderson, and so on — is the important discovery that
          Dos Passos wants to reinforce here. And, as I suggested earlier, that very networking is
          the basic unit of social organization within the fictional mode of narration, and its
          replacement of "narratives of home and family" that
          traditionally organize the novel makes for an important reconception of the nation — one
          that demonstrates the network’s foothold in literary production and intellectual history
          in the modern period as it mediates the impulses toward outright social disintegration and
          the traditional ligatures of family, place, and work.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">A major aspect of that networked conceptualization is the contingency that runs
          throughout the fictional narrative mode. The appearances and reappearances, the meetings
          and departures — these nodal connections tend to take place by chance. Besides Dick
          Savage’s connection to Bingham, one might study the contingent crossings of G.H. Barrow
          with "Mac" McCreary, stenographer Janey Williams, Dick Savage, the wandering Anne
          Elizabeth "Daughter" Trent, labor advocate Mary French, activist Ben Compton, and
          aspiring actress Margo Dowling — an improbably wide and inclusive social circle to travel
          in. Or, to belabor the point with one particularly rich case with a more concrete locus,
          at the last of Eveline Hutchins’s cocktail parties — indeed, the party that concludes
            <cite class="title italic">The Big Money</cite> — Mary French briefly glimpses Margo Dowling.
          French’s profile thus far has centered on her social activism through Hull House and her
          advocacy for Sacco and Vanzetti, and Dowling has been something of a foil character,
          self-involved and materialistic in her fervent pursuit of stardom. The connection is a
          fleeting one: "Mary saw a small woman with blue eyelids and
              features regular as those of a porcelain doll under a mass of paleblond hair turn for
              a second to smile at somebody before she went out through the sliding doors" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dospassos1936">#dospassos1936</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">The very lack of intimacy in this last connection gets to the heart of what many
          criticize as disorganization, disaggregation, or atomization in the fictional narrative
          mode. Mary and Margo are not introduced, they do not speak, and they do not even enjoy
          mutual recognition since Margo would not identify a lowly activist by sight. In fact, the
          only thing they have in common is Eveline Hutchins, their mediating link. And this dearth
          of intimacy gets to the issue of knowability, the lack of which Denning finds so
          troubling. It is true: whatever connections there are between these characters, there is
          rarely enough to constitute a knowable community. Even in the case of family, most
          characters carry a high degree of estrangement: Joe Williams, Dick Savage,
          "Daughter"
          Trent, Ben Compton, Charley Anderson, Margo Dowling, Mary French — nearly all of the major
          characters are deeply alienated from their families in some way or another. And in the
          absence of any knowable community to assemble these characters, one might not be
          completely mistaken to conclude that contingency is the organizing principle of the social
          in the fictional narration.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">It is a mistake, however, to read the shortages of intimacy and knowability as
          constituting a narrative of dispersal. Instead, the fictional mode of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> insists on the interconnectivity of its networked characters, and while
          those relationships may lack profundity, the abundance of such connective chains
          demonstrates Dos Passos’s totalizing impulse. As with the fragmented narration of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s form, the characters in the fictional mode of narration
          are best viewed not simply as indications of the fragmentation of the social, but in terms
          of the network that connects such disparate individuals.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">This polarity of dispersal and totality might be illuminated by Jean-Paul Sartre’s work
          on seriality and the practico-inert in his <cite class="title italic">Critique of Dialectical
            Reason</cite><span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sartre1960">#sartre1960</a></span>. In an essay from 1947, Sartre hailed Dos Passos as "the greatest writer of our time," but his concern in the <cite class="title italic">Critique</cite> is not a literary one <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sartre1947">#sartre1947</a></span>. Rather, his goal is to understand the development of group formations. Among his three
          modes of group formation — seriality, fusion, and institution — the series most readily
          relates to the problems readers might raise in Dos Passos’s character-threads. Sartre
          investigates the series with an anecdote of a queue at a bus stop: the series is "a plurality of isolations" wherein no individual has a relation to
          the other beyond the common need of transportation, wherein each individual in the series
          is completely interchangeable with any other <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sartre1960">#sartre1960</a></span>. "There are serial behaviour," he continues, "serial feelings, and serial thoughts; in other words, <em class="emph">a series is
                a mode of being for individuals both in relation to one another and in relation to
                their common being</em> and this mode of being transforms all their
              structures" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sartre1960">#sartre1960</a></span>. Thus, the series certainly expresses the
          dispersal felt by Dos Passos’s characters: they are isolated from each other in almost
          every meaningful way; as types to represent various developments — labor advocacy during
          the teens and 20s, the birth of public relations, etc. — they are often interchangeable
          with each other. And most importantly, they conceive of themselves as a series — as
          evident in the estrangement of families and the superficiality of relationships between
          the major titular character-threads like Mary French and Margo Dowling.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">The reader, however, does not share that experience of dispersal, and it is from her
          vantage point that network dynamics become visible. For Sartre, the series can never
          approach totality precisely because of its atomizing limitations: "The totality of the gathering is only the passive action of a
              practico-inert object on a dispersal. The limitation of the gathering to these
              particular individuals is only an accidental negation" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sartre1960">#sartre1960</a></span>. He describes "practico-inert" as matter that is "being-outside-in-the-thing" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sartre1960">#sartre1960</a></span> — which is to say, an exteriorized object or
          practice that maintains the group from without<a class="noteRef" href="#d37764e763">[2]</a>. In the case of the queue at the
          bus stop, that exteriorized matter is the bus itself, the transportation system, the city,
          and so on. There are many forms of the practico-inert in the content of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> — Moorehouse’s public relations industry, Charley
          Anderson’s work for the airline industry, and so on. To the extent that the practico-inert
          content constitutes a material axis of connection, the characters are networked by these
          material, exteriorized mediations. But these material mediations do nothing to overcome
          the subjectivity of seriality that determines how the characters conceive of each other in
          disconnection. The practico-inert that successfully resolves the dispersal and
          disaggregation of these characters is Dos Passos’s totalizing vision. Or, in other words,
          the practico-inert that networks <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s characters is form
          itself.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">None of this is to resolve these problematics with a critical cliché — form is content! —
          but recognizing the form’s stabilization of these diasporic figures into a network is key
          to understanding the connective logic that prevails in <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>
          and that is the defining strategy of Dos Passos’s magnum opus. To say that these
          characters do not realize their interconnection is not to say that they are, in fact,
          disconnected. The impact of seriality on the subjectivity of Dos Passos’s characters is
          undeniable, but it is also clear that Dos Passos strives to show their networked
          interrelations to the reader. This networked reading not only resolves the misgivings one
          might have concerning the disaggregation of Dos Passos’s character-threads, but it also
          sets Dos Passos as a pioneer in conceptualizing the network as the twentieth century’s
          defining organization for the social. Above all, a networked reading of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> enables us to perceive the interconnections that do take
          place in the absence of ligatures such as place or family.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">It would be unsound to label these relationships intimate or knowable, but it would be
          equally unjustified to claim that Dos Passos has nothing but "ill assorted
            people"
          populating his fictional scene. Instead, recognizing the networking of these characters
          enables readers of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> to grasp the social organization
          theorized by Dos Passos, an organizational scheme that would only become familiar toward
          the end of the century.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head"><cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> and the Intellectual History of the Network</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">Perhaps with an explanation of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite>’s networked form and
          its innovations in characterological connectivity in mind we can contextualize some of the
          puzzlement expressed by Dos Passos’s contemporaries in their reviews of the trilogy and
          its volumes: the formal experimentation of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> anticipates
          some network dynamics that did not become a commonplace until later in the century. But
          even in the moment of modernism, the network was becoming a powerful ideational and
          organizational figure. And one might pause to think about how <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> participates in this general shift toward network thinking that took
          place even in advance of the digital revolution. Randolph Bourne’s 1916 essay "Trans-National America," for example, eschewed the melting-pot
          metaphor in favor of a "clusters" theory of the nation that today we would articulate
          in the vocabulary of the network. And during the first decades of the century,
          intensifying through the 1920s, the modern corporation — today a major locus of network
          ideology and practice — began to make common a practice of diversification that slowly
          reorganized the corporation as a decentralized, multidivisional, networked body. Moreover,
          one can read Fordism as an early experiment in networked production schemes, as I argued
          above.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">In short, during the modern period the United States was setting out on a long path that
          would result in the network’s figural ascendancy by the closing decades of the century.
          And, to belabor the point, this development of network thinking took place independently
          of the advances in digital technologies that are commonly assumed to have sparked the
          field of network theory. Alongside formative developments like the establishment of the
          corporation and the fracturing of the melting pot, Dos Passos’s contributions to network
          thinking may seem rather insignificant. But I want to argue that <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> is nonetheless an important marker of the intellectual history of the
          network’s figural grip on the U.S. over the last century. If we read <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> — or other modern texts like "Trans-National
            America," for that matter — as antecedents to contemporary deployments of the
          network, we can begin to see not only the long lineage of the importance of the network in
          American intellectual history, but also some alternatives to today’s commonly accepted
          conventions of network theory, and especially the genre of the network narrative.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">If we take literary representation as one marker of intellectual history, we can see in
          the development of the network narrative genre that commitment to network thinking dates
          back to the moderns. Registering the genre in modernism not only stretches the literary
          history of that genre, but also expands the conventions generally ascribed to the genre.
          Where Bordwell limits the genre to films predicated on the six-degrees theorem and
          Ciccoricco confines it to hyperlinked environments, a reading of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> as a network narrative opens the genre to new — or rather, old — methods
          of network narration that rely more on formal fragmentation and totalization. A focus on
          network narratives that operate on the connective ligatures of form itself offers a
          radical rewriting of scholarship on the genre that could allow us to read networked
          narration in new media — for example, in the avant-garde experiments in collage and
          montage techniques that were major interventions in modern arts, and that constructed
          visual narrative across space according to the logic of cooperative nodal
          configurations.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">Finally, I want to gesture toward a broader hypothesis about intellectual history and the
          network — one that would require a wider range of works to substantiate, but one that we
          can see emerging from this case study of <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> and perhaps
          from this collection of essays as a unit. Often it is assumed that the widespread use of
          the network as a figural dominant across the humanities and even across the business world
          is somehow a derivative of the digital revolution. The logic here is that the network
          became a familiar model for these other fields because of its role in information and
          communications technologies, and that it was extrapolated from its digital context for use
          as a figural and ideational model in literary representation, in humanities scholarship,
          or in theoretical formulations. What I want to suggest is a different source of origin in
          that relationship: it is not so much that the digital revolution provided a new figure
          that these other fields could appropriate for new scholarly and literary explorations, but
          that it gave articulation to networked dynamics that had already been present there —
          indeed, present since the modern period. In other words, networks were constitutive
          elements of American intellectual production decades before the digital revolution, and
          while the digital revolution brought helpful articulation to the intellectual use of
          networked dynamics, it only did so well after it was already an established feature of the
          American intellectual landscape. Otherwise, we could not look back on <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> or other modern texts and see so easily the networked dynamics they use
          to inform their texts. Reading <cite class="title italic">U.S.A.</cite> as a network narrative
          is not the work of anachronistically projecting contemporary digital fixations backwards,
          then, but of seeing how a modern text can prefigure the way we talk about networks
          today.</div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d37764e478"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>See Christopher Phillips’s introduction to <cite class="title italic">Montage and
