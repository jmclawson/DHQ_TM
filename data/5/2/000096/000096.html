The article argues that Stein first sees language as data that human beings are compelled to parse in even the most contextless and semantically "noisy" frameworks, which shapes the purpose and form of Stein's notoriously difficult prose poem, "Tender Buttons"; the ease with which meaning can be exchanged emphasizes the importance of the ways in which a given meaning is selected from a set of possible meanings rather than interpreted or revealed. While this may simply reiterate the mode of "Tender Buttons" in different terms, the paper's crucial intervention is in its positioning of the chance selection of significance as the mode of signification that animates her wartime memoir "Wars I Have Seen". Like words in the poem, political identity in occupied France is unstable and waits to be parsed in the act of encounters with others and with history. In her narrative's foregrounding of and experimental play with the conventions of memoir, Stein discovers the shifting nature of her main character (herself) in a series of ruminations and chance meetings; an early version of the network narrative emerges in the nodal structure of the story that undermines chronological and nationalist frames of signification.</p></div><div class="div div0"><div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p class="ptext">Organization is a failure and everywhere the world over everybody

              alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it
              down from subclass to subclass…. The human mind does not work that way. It operates by
              association. With one item in its grasp, [the human mind] snaps instantly to the next
              that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate
              web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. (<a href="#bush1945">Vannevar Bush, "As We May Think,"
              1945</a>)</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="div div0"><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In the final passage of one of her last brief essays, "Reflection on
            the Atomic Bomb" (1945), Gertrude Stein figures atomic technology as an
          informational effect. Having insisted that she could never take any interest in something
            "as destructive as all that" (i.e. the atomic bomb), Stein
          implies that atomic military technology has drawn much <em class="emph">undue</em> attention. There
          is no logical reason, she argues, for anyone to be <em class="emph">scared</em> of the atomic bomb,
          and "if you are not scared the atomic bomb is not interesting."
          Thus, as if to account sociologically for what must now be deemed merely
            <em class="emph">pseudo</em> interest, she writes, <blockquote><p>Everybody gets so
              much information all day long that they lose their common sense. They listen so much
              that they forget to be natural. This is a nice story. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#stein1990">#stein1990</a></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The vagueness of Stein’s reference to <em class="term">information</em> (information about what?
          Where does "everybody" get it?) throws into relief the sense of sheer
            <em class="emph">quantity</em> conveyed by the sentence. The apposition of the first and second
          sentences implies that it is by "listening <em class="emph">so
            much</em>" that "everybody gets <em class="emph">so much</em>
            information." This great quantity of information, moreover, is what alienates one
          from constitutive elements of self, namely "common sense" and being
            "natural" (human nature, perhaps?); according to Stein’s logic in
          this essay, this alienation of one’s <em class="emph">natural</em>"common sense" leaves one susceptible to an overwhelming fear, which
          results in one becoming preoccupied with the atomic bomb. As if in an attempt to remedy
          this alienating effect, Stein redirects both the essay’s topic as well as its reader’s
          attention with her last sentence. "This is a nice story," she
          writes, indicating with what at first seems to be a non-sequitur, that neither a
          bombardment of information, nor its destruction of one’s "common
            sense," can undermine the cheerful, intractable, utterly human practice of
          narration.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">It would seem that, as long as there is a mode of narrative capable of comprehending and
          inoculating the human mind against modernity’s ever-widening informational flow, Stein
          fears no evil. In this paper, I argue that Stein’s last memoir of the war years, <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have Seen</cite> (1945), is such a narrative, one whose
          understanding of the way that meaning can become radically uncertain in heavily
          syntactical modes of signification essentially performs in experimental memoir form the
          work that <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite> (1914) had done in poetic form years
          earlier. I position Stein as presciently concerned with distinguishing meaning from what
          cyberneticists would come to describe properly as <em class="term">information</em>, and I
          demonstrate how Tender Buttons reaches the same conclusions about the relationship between
          the two as would the information theorists of the cybernetic era. Finally, I suggest that
          the story Stein tells in <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have Seen</cite> is an early network
          narrative in that it searches for a form to express the nodal value of both individuals
          and nations at a time when global technologies (radio, world war) dramatically altered
          what it meant to be connected to the rest of the world. The memoir is not only about the
          experience of living in France during the occupation but also, on a metadiegetic level,
          about the need for narrative to adapt to modern forms of global connectivity, which are
          fostered as much by the wireless as they are by the patterns evinced by world war. In
            <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have Seen</cite>, Stein foregrounds the uncertainties of
          meaning and identity inherent in narrating the contemporary political and historical
          landscape as she experienced it during the Second World War. Stein’s anxious anticipation
          of the outcome of war is not the only thing that produces the narrative’s texture of
          uncertainty; Stein understands that the dominant <em class="emph">ways of seeing</em> during World
          War II incorporate individuals and nations as nodes capable of having their identities
          switched on and off by networks of communication and power. <cite class="title italic">Wars I
            Have Seen</cite> is thus Stein’s answer to the modern composition of the burgeoning
          information age. In it, semiosis is as contingent on immediate situation as the nouns of
            <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite> are on syntax and subjective associations
          with their surrounding words. Unlike the "nineteenth century," whose
          science, politics, and literature saw the globe as a canvas of commodities to be
          controlled and stabilized, Stein finds the "twentieth century" (whose
          commencement she dates irreverently to approximately 1942) to be characterized by a global
          interconnectedness so thorough that the question is not how to stabilize meaning but how
          to maintain identity <em class="emph">through a narrative of the informational nature of contemporary
            experience</em>.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Cybernetics and Stein: The Problem Information</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The kind of rhetorical maneuver that Stein performs in her remarks about the atomic bomb
          would lift easily into the vernacular of our twenty-first century in which steady streams
          of news and entertainment cross the globe and travel into our homes and personal
          electronic devices along numerous channels of communication each and every day. In its
          current phase of morphogenesis, the dominant usage of <em class="term">information</em> signifies a
          powerful if ether-like substance. <em class="term">Information</em> can be invoked today as
          anything from a paradigm of economic development to a psychological bane. One need not
          cast out very far to find public figures aligning social and psychological ills, like job
          insecurity and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, with the contemporary
          proliferations of information technology.<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e234">[1]</a> But what does it mean for Stein to diagnose her
            <em class="term">atomic age</em> reading audience, subjected to "so much
            information" and overly indulgent in habits of listening, with a loss of
            "common sense" and the failure to remember "to be
            natural"? What context shapes and expresses Stein’s recognition of
            <em class="term">information</em> as something capable of altering the mind without having to
          negotiate with the physical substrate of the body? Moreover, how can we characterize her
          gesture of singling out <em class="term">information</em> as culprit for misapprehension? Is it
          condemnatory? Celebratory? I suggest that her remarks express a less tendentious (though
          by no means indifferent) investment in and awareness of the growing dependence of nations
          on communications technology to establish not only their power but also their identity. On
          one level, Stein’s stance of irreverence toward the devastating potentials of atomic
          technology, which she dismisses with edifying remarks about <em class="term">information,</em>
          takes for granted the materiality of the bodies recently eliminated or injured by the
          atomic blasts in Japan; her naïve lack of "interest" in the
          atomic bomb enacts a secondary "vaporization" of the corporeal subject.
          On another level, the attention she pays to the "human mind"
          also attests to anxieties about subjective composition that were contained by the
          discourses of science and technology at the end of World War II.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">If Stein invokes <em class="term">information</em> as a figure capable of weaving minds and bombs,
          words and bodies, human beings and machines, into a complex network of signification, she
          adds a faint but prescient voice to the discursive chorus accompanying new
          techno-scientific practices which would produce a reified concept of information in the
          post-war era. In her "nice story," Stein highlights a
          destabilization of the boundary separating communication technologies and human life — a
          destabilization that literary and historical narratives would later situate in the advent
          of the cybernetic worldview. The project of cybernetics and Stein’s (especially later)
          writing, moreover, reflect common cultural concerns and experiences situated in the
          changing scientific, military, and political practices of the Second World War. If the
          structure of literary narrative was altered by the cybernetic desire to view the human
          being as simply one module in a web of communication systems without stable hierarchy or
          linearity — i.e., in a <em class="term">network</em>, Stein’s prescient representation of this
          modularity begs to be understood as a part of an ongoing cross-disciplinary genealogy
          (rather than an anomalous preview of a movement that began with cybernetics and simply
          diffused over time into the field of Literature). </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Genius to the Rescue</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">As a response to the realization that human minds had begun to be inundated with
          information, Stein enacts in "Reflection" what, in one of her
          oft-cited lectures of the 1930s, she described as the essence of "genius, of being most intensely alive" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#stein1990">#stein1990</a></span>. That is, her essay demonstrates what it is
            "to be at once talking and listening, doing both things, not as if
            there were one thing." It is as if, she suggests, there were always at least an
          implied listener for every speaker and vice-versa, a dynamic communication channel formed
          by dialogue (even if intrasubjective) rather than just one "thing."
          When, at the conclusion of her brief essay, she writes "This is a nice
            story," she retroactively imbues the text with a dialogic voice, proving that
            <em class="term">listening</em> is not going on to the exclusion of telling. The combination of
          these two acts would seem to recuperate and relocate the source of the essay’s
            <em class="term">information</em> from the news of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to
          the reflexive, highly self-conscious dialogism of her own literary modernism.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In one sense, Stein’s essay succeeds in evading its own topic, subverting the referential
          function of writing by becoming a playful meta-commentary upon the essay’s narrative
          potential. For Stein, that is, to reflect on the atom bomb is to reflect on
            <em class="term">narrative</em> — the subject she took up explicitly in her American lectures but
          was an implied theme of her writing generally. In a complementary sense, the essay denies
          the gruesome potency of atomic technology. As is well known, the United States dropped the
          uranium-fueled "Little Boy" on Hiroshima and then the
          plutonium-fueled "Fat Man" on Nagasaki within days of one
          another during the month of August, 1945. Tens of thousands of people were vaporized
          instantly and thousands more left injured and afflicted with radiation poisoning.<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e333">[2]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">While disturbingly ironic, the dismissive tone of Stein’s "Reflection" also bespeaks a wish to render the atomic bomb a subject less
          formidable than allied newspaper and radio coverage had inscribed it in the public mind
          between the bombings and Victory Japan Day (August 15, 1945). Indeed, the text of the
          Japanese surrender figured the atomic bomb as an imminent and global threat to human life.
          By August 15th, Japanese Emperor Hirohito was prepared to surrender his country, which he
          did officially by broadcasting his intentions to the nation at noon. In the "Imperial Rescript on Surrender," Hirohito noted the uncompromising
          pressure that the United States’ use of atomic weaponry had placed on the country’s
          attitude toward the proposed Potsdam Declaration, explaining that <blockquote><p>…the
            enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is,
            indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to
            fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese
            nation, but also it would lead to the <em class="emph">total extinction of human
              civilization</em>. (emphasis added) <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#wikipedia">#wikipedia</a></span></p></blockquote> While the military restricted
          the release of all information regarding the development of the bomb, news coverage
            <em class="emph">following</em> the attacks was controlled to "bombard"
          readers with the sense of the military campaign’s overwhelming strength. Governments in
          both the U.S. and Japan quieted questions about the mysterious "disease
            x," symptoms of which would ultimately be diagnosed as radiation poisoning
          from atomic fallout, but stories of the bombs’ terrifying power were constructed and
          disseminated freely in Allied news reports. After the Hiroshima bombing, President Truman
          broadcast a message threatening utter destruction for Japan unless the country’s leaders
          surrendered unconditionally. The message, which would be excerpted in western news
          channels in the following days, reached Japan on the day of the Hiroshima bombing and
          stated that the U.S. was <blockquote><p>…now prepared to obliterate rapidly and
            completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have....It was to spare the Japanese

          pervade the Cold War era.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">A BBC news story of 9 August 1945 similarly conveyed an image of information bombardment:

          taken together, the images invoked by Roosevelt, of the "obliteration"
          of every "productive enterprise" of the nation as a whole, and the
          performative "bombing" of the land with a redundancy of print messages

          power to end or sustain life of which the nation had just proven itself capable. And by

          and fear that news of the atomic blasts has recently spread. While it has been suggested
          that Stein’s ascent to celebrity status in the 1930s forced her to abandon "genius" as an heuristic model for writing, I contend that "genius" emerges here.<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e428">[4]</a> It appears uncannily in the form of
          Stein’s meta-narrative commentary, which defends her conception of the human mind as an
          autopoietic entity from the bombardment of dehumanizing information. Indeed, it is the
          mind’s ability to harness and assimilate the ever-increasing quantities of information
          flowing through widening channels of communications technologies for socio-biopolitical
          ends that constituted the most pressing intellectual problem for Stein at the end of her
          career.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Though she often intimated her commitment to teaching her readers and audiences how to

          its persistence. And as she waited until the last years of her life to explain the
          hypothesis of her literary experiment, so too would she wait until the last moment to
          suggest that the threat to "genius" was something the
          twenty-first century will readily recognize: information. Stein, whose humanism depended
          on the concept of "genius," as she defined it, was like an
          early information theorist in that she was committed to understanding and elucidating the
          way in which the human mind makes sense of and uses information.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">The salient issue raised by considering Stein’s experimental writing in conjunction with
          the information theory of the 1940s lies in the way that both projects began to model
          communication on the constituent technologies of everyday practices: In Stein’s case,
          these were literary and artistic, and in Claude Shannon’s and Norbert Wiener’s, they were
          electrical and computational. But both would reflect a growing conception of
            <em class="term">life</em> that no longer afforded the human being either a stable political or
          cultural identity or a relationship to the world based primarily on a notion of agency
          underwritten by volition and desire; to understand how messages were conveyed, whether
          verbally or electronically, entailed a notion of the sender/receiver already spliced into
          often invisible networks of signification. In the case of <em class="emph">human</em>
          sender/receivers, meaning was — for information theorists as much as for Stein — primarily
          a matter of how well, albeit only temporarily, one could stabilize the information flowing

            Buttons</cite>, and the cyberneticists, through their work to develop faster and more
          robust telecommunications lines (Claude Shannon) and smart anti-aircraft missiles (Norbert
          Wiener), discovered that the true nature of information was, in fact, uncertainty. Though
          it preceded her explicit recognition of the threat of <em class="term">information</em> to the
          organization of the human mind, <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite> had already
          evinced Stein’s investment in understanding how communication functions meaningfully when
          communication channels lose most of the conventions that receivers usually rely on to
          stabilize semantic content. In <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite>, she engineers
          words to make sense primarily at the level of syntax by defamiliarizing the reading
          conventions. In the first stanza of the first section, "Objects," Stein offers her reader a clue about how to read the rest of the prose
          poem: <blockquote><p class="ptext">A CARAFE, THAT IS A BLIND GLASS</p><p class="quote">A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color
                and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered
                in not resembling. The difference is spreading. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#stein1990">#stein1990</a></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">The capitalized heading preceding the paragraph pretends to draw the reader into a
          familiar hermeneutical process. It seems as if to say, "The paragraph
            will consist of the author’s description of the object referred to in the
            heading." The familiar referential design instructs the eye (as traditionally do
          the titles of works in the pictorial arts, which of course heavily inflected Stein’s
          writing experiments) to regard the heading as the primary, or least ambiguous sign of the
            <em class="term">object</em> being viewed by the author. Yet embedded in the heading sits a
          secondary heading, "THAT IS A BLIND GLASS," which denies the
          simplicity of that literary construct; the comma separating "A
            CARAFE" from "THAT IS A BLIND GLASS" functions to yoke
          unambiguous <em class="term">name</em> and ambiguous <em class="term">description</em> in a proximity
          canceling out the referential distance between referent and description, which the
          conventional heading purports to create. The relationship of the capitalized heading to
          the paragraph below, moreover, serves as overture to what Stein performs within the first
          line of the stanza: "A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and
            nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing."
          As Peter Schwenger has suggested in a reading that correctly challenges an interpretation
          of <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite> as a display of the "senseless" materiality of words existing on their own, a carafe is plausibly, in
          fact, "a blind glass." Unlike its "cousin," the drinking "glass," the carafe has a
          flared lip, which "makes it extremely difficult to drink from….The
              'eye' that is the vessel’s opening has, then, a certain negative
            quality that might be equated to blindness." The carafe, a vessel of
            <em class="emph">cut</em> glass, moreover, might produce the idea of its "hurt color" [<a class="ref" href="#schwenger2001">Schwenger 2001</a>, 104]. Yet one might also read this line as a
          comparison of a carafe to a <em class="term">pitcher</em>, rather than a drinking glass; a carafe
          often lacks the pitcher’s handle, which creates an oval hole when seen in side view. Like
          an animal of prey, the pitcher stands with one eye viewable along its profile. The carafe,
          then, looks like a "kind" of "blind"
          animal represented "in glass." The overdetermined nature of the
          object in this stanza works to figure it as "an arrangement in a
            system to pointing,""nothing strange," and while unusual and unfamiliar, "not unordered in not resembling" what the reader expects to find in
          poetry. Like the "WAY LAY VEGETABLE" of "Food," the reader must not rely on names in headings to remain stable referents.
          She can only "suppose it is ex." That is, the reader can only
          suppose that the vegetable garden will be waylaid for any number of things, such as a
          visit from "sam," or preparation for a "meal"; or the vegetable might be saved this ambush by "a
            cake" eaten before the vegetables can be picked and thus not harming the "nervous bed rows" for another day (yet another "new mercy"). "Rooms," in which Stein no longer offers
          her reader the conventional headings, continues to "suppose"
          sense: <blockquote><p>If comparing a piece that is a size that is recognized as not a
            size but a piece, comparing a piece with what is not recognized but what is used as it
            is held by holding, comparing these two comes to be repeated. Suppose they are put
            together, suppose that there is an interruption….Is there an exchange, is there a
            resemblance to the sky which is admitted to be there and the stars which can be seen. Is
            there. That was a question. There was no certainty. Fitting a failing meant that any two
            were indifferent and yet they were all connecting that.</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">This passage outlines the processes involved in Stein’s theory of writing. The habitual
          repetition of an unfamiliar comparison of two words can produce qan "interruption" of the sense one or both of those words make. Words can "exchange" their "resemblance" to things
            "<em class="emph">admitted</em> to be there," — abstract concepts,
          x-rays, or, like the sky, the vault of empty space which lacks particular location — for
          resemblances to things "which can be seen" and mapped (even if
          only as the trace of their, perhaps, now extinguished presence). Stein finds, in <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite>, that no words or objects are so "indifferent" that they are exempt from the system "connecting""failing" and "fittings" — as in the
          knowledge gained having tried on a dress in the wrong size. What Stein sees, when she
          looks at objects, food, and rooms, is the uncertainty underwriting the process of
          sense-making; like a question, the act of reference implies uncertainty.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Three years after Stein invoked <em class="term">information</em> in her essay on the atomic bomb,
          Claude Shannon would publish a theory of communication — one formulated in studies on
          telegraphic transmission by Bell Labs engineers in the interwar years — in which messages
          signified according to a similarly <em class="emph">uncertain</em>"system to pointing."<blockquote><p>The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing
              at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.
              Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated
              according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic
              aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant
              aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The
              system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which
              will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. [<a class="ref" href="#shannon1949">Shannon &amp; Weaver 1949</a>, 1]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">In a sense, Shannon seeks to generate a mathematical system of communication akin to
          Stein’s theory of language. To ensure proper operation, the message, for Shannon, had to
          remain a question of possible selection, since "at the time of
            design," the electronic receiver could not know which would constitute the
          consequential "bit" of information transmitted. Shannon’s work
          drew from the technical definition of "information," which, as
          I stated above, had been worked out by his predecessors at Bell Laboratories. In what may
          have amounted to a trivial decision, Hartley substituted the word <em class="term">information</em>
          for what his colleague Nyquist had been referring to as <em class="term">intelligence</em> to
          describe, in 1928, the matter which telegraphs transmit. Because it smacked less of a
          human capacity than <em class="term">intelligence</em>, <em class="term">information</em> theory was born to
          produce a more sophisticated understanding of the way electronic media transmit messages
          and communicate with one another. Communication, until the advent of the information
          sciences, had been a matter of three basic problems: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
          The information theory that Shannon and Wiener would promulgate (however differently they
          would conceive of the relationship of <em class="term">information</em> to <em class="term">entropy</em>)
          restricted the concept of <em class="term">information</em> to its stochastic sense, explicitly
          cleaving it from <em class="term">meaning</em>. Thus, they narrowed down communication to the
          problem of syntax. Bracketing semantics for the specific purpose of emphasizing syntax
          allows for an accurate measure of information, which, in Shannon’s theory, constitutes all
          of the "possible messages" which the receiver can "select." The content of communication in this model is possibility
          to select. While one cannot say, despite her transgressions of conventional word usage,
          that Stein obviates or ignores semantics, it is fair to say that her use of syntax was
          self-consciously "informational," in the sense of Shannon’s
          theory of communication.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">That Stein and the cyberneticists demonstrate congruent theories of information belies
          the distance between experimental writing and scientific research at mid-century. This is
          not to say that there was collaboration or even recognition across the two cultures in
          this instance. In fact, the only recognition that Stein received from the sciences
          occurred when, in 1934, B.F. Skinner patently <em class="emph">diagnosed</em> her with normal motor
          automatism in response to reading <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e714">[5]</a> While the two sides might not have
          admitted it, however, Stein and the cyberneticists were essentially realizing, in
          parallel, that meaning owes as much (if not more) to chance association as (than) it does
          to predetermined organizations of signifiers and signifieds. In effect, Stein discovered
          the informational nature of the human mind, years before Vannevar Bush would declare, that
              <blockquote><p>[the human mind] operates by association. With one item in
              its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of
              thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the
              brain. [<a class="ref" href="#bush1945">Bush 1945</a>]</p></blockquote> It was with this Steinian,
          "web"-like, associational human mind that Bush envisioned his "Memex," a machine and interface that would, more efficiently than
          any existing logical system, access the "record" of all extant
          scientific knowledge. In describing the organizing principle of what now sounds uncannily
          like the modern personal computer, Bush’s verbal schema of the Memex could have as easily
          described the organizing principle of Stein’s experimental (<em class="emph">not automatic</em>)
          writing. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">From Uncertainty in Language to Uncertain Times: Stein’s Network Narrative</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">Stein’s informational treatment of language and meaning reemerged in prose as she
          searched for an appropriate form by which to describe global connectivity in the twentieth
          century. While Stein’s discovery of the informational nature of language in <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite> is primarily celebratory, when she applies the same
          principles of composition to the memoir form in <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have
            Seen</cite>, her inscription of the uncertainty underwriting meaning becomes more
          ambivalent. Though less obviously experimental than <cite class="title italic">Tender
            Buttons</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Wars</cite> does not simply record Stein’s
          experiences in occupied France; the form and content of the text play irreverently with
          memoirist conventions of chronology, and the international cast of characters (including
          several Gertrude Steins) become progressively less well-defined as wartime collusions of
          power take shape through the exposition. Form and content commence conventionally, as
          Stein seduces us into taking her to be the subject of just another memoir in which she
          marvels both at the nineteenth-century project of discovering and thereby uniting the
          globe as well as at the sense of safety bestowed upon the world by the systematic
          observations of the evolutionist’s outlook. But as the narrative draws into the present,
          it becomes clearer that the subject of the memoir is really a question: How does one tell
          the story of the particular present in which Stein writes? I suggest that Stein’s attempt
          to answer that question constitutes an early network narrative in which temporalities and
          power structures become progressively less stable as frames of meaning. In the scenes she
          records, Stein loses frame after frame of both local and global reference until she shows
          that even she is no longer in command of her national, cultural, and political identity.
          Being part of a network narrative for Stein means submitting oneself to uncertainty not
          merely at the level of situational knowledge but more radically at the levels of history
          and identity (that is, socio-political history and personal history). </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">In the early pages of <cite class="title italic">Wars</cite>, Stein calls the 19th century
            "the gradual domination of the globe as piece by piece by piece it
            became known and became all of a piece…." The totalization of the globe through
          colonization, translation, assimilation, and electronic communication technologies, for
          Stein, characterizes "the 19th century," which, however
          chronologically denoted, anachronistically includes the period of the two World Wars as
          well. Only in 1943 would she concede that the "19th century"
          was coming to an end because "[n]ow they can do the radio in so many
            languages that nobody any longer dreams of a single language, and there should not any
            longer be dreams of conquest because the globe is all one…." For Stein, the
          century "turns" when geopolitical and technological
          mobilization make the globe a known object and render obsolete any "dreams of a single language."[<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 17] Thus, according to Stein, being globally connected in
          the 19th century depended on the logic of uncovering what was covered, homogenizing what
          was heterogeneous, rendering "all one."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">While Zamenhoff’s Esperanto may offer Stein a working symbol for the logic of "19th-century" global connection, she spends the rest of the memoir
          mining her experiences in occupied France for a similarly "objective
            correlative," as it were, for the logic of 20th-century global connection. The
          most consistent theme to emerge from her records, however, is uncertainty. On one level,
          Stein draws our attention to the uncertainty she and fellow French countryside villagers
          felt about what course the war would take, who to trust, and what the world would look
          like after the war. On another level, the uncertainty is about Stein’s ambivalent national
          affiliation and moments of alienation from her American and Jewish identities. Though
          Stein might have composed <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have Seen</cite> in the manner of a
          daily journal, her decision to foreground the instability of identity and the uncertain
          future of world events is strategic. Out of the ruins of late "19th-century" certainty, Stein hopes to find that her ruminations, her
          encounters with French villagers, Vichy officials, and, finally, American GIs, will
          perform the pattern of identity-production and global contact characteristic of the yet
          unknown postwar world order.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">What’s At Stake</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">At stake in approaching Stein’s memoir as a cultural inscription of the experience of a
          global network is the assumption that such experience did not demand a new narrative form
          until complex negotiations between what Manuel Castells calls "the Net
            and the Self" became the main source of meaning for individuals. Leaving this
          assumption untroubled encourages one to seek for the network narrative’s formal prototype,
          as it were, in postmodern texts like Thomas Pynchon’s <cite class="title italic">The Crying of
            Lot 49</cite> (1968) or the narrative production concurrent with the development of
          personal electronic devices in the 1970s, "in the United States, and
            to some extent in California" [<a class="ref" href="#castells2000">Castells 2000</a>, 5]. Stein’s <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have
            Seen</cite>, as I will demonstrate, troubles this very assumption by documenting the
          rise of the network society before it consummated its relationship with the postwar era
          and the first tech boom of the late 20th century. For, if we take the form of Stein’s
          recorded experiences, observations, and meditations during the Second World War as
          seriously as her content, we behold a self-conscious record of a shift from a relatively
          stable, hierarchical system of global connectivity associated with the 19th century to a
          radically unpredictable, uncertain, shifting network associated with the 20th century.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">Reading <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have Seen</cite> as a precursor to the modern
          network narrative also gives us a chance to relate Stein’s aggressively experimental
          formal strategies to the political collusion and conservatism that her critics have been
          surprised to find imbued in her later writings. This analysis is useful, therefore, not
          only for the attention it gives an archive usually considered out of bounds of network
          theory, but also for the way it frames Stein’s later work without conflating the semantic
          instability of poetics with reductive politics. Adaptations of Kristevan concepts to
          figure Stein’s experimental modernism as a performative disruption of the subjective
          stability of the word,<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e825">[6]</a> though useful in articulations of feminist poetics, have also fueled
          reductive political rhetoric. Stein biographer Ulla Dydo, for instance, appears to make a
          slippage from formal analysis to a celebratory equation of poetics and politics when she
          writes, <blockquote><p>Stein’s disembodied words inhabit the enchanted forest of
                <cite class="title italic">As You Like It</cite>, where figures join and part, marriages
              are made and unmade, names and identities change naturally. Free to change their
              referential ties, Stein’s texts are written in the language of true comedy, where
              nothing is absolute, hierarchies are not respected, roles and indignities can change,
              and <em class="emph">the only authority is the wide democratic freedom of the word that can move,
                make, and remake itself</em>. (emphasis added)  [<a class="ref" href="#dydo2003">Dydo 2003</a>, 18–9]</p></blockquote>"Disembodied words" enjoy a "conjugal" freedom, in which a "naturally" endowed
          instability of identity translates into "the wide democratic freedom
            of the word." I would by no means disagree with Dydo’s claims that Stein’s
          poetics push against the boundaries of verbal convention to the extent that her words play
          with, more than they submissively "respect," any hierarchies of
          order. But in glossing Stein’s poetics as a "democratic"
          challenge to anything "absolute" (except, perhaps, for the
          absolute "freedom" of movement of the Steinian word), Dydo
          commits her reading to a literary theory which appears tenuous when confronted by the
          ideological differences animating the respective political agency of Dydo and her subject,
          especially considering the deeply entrenched political ambiguities of Stein’s historical
          situation during World War II.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">The way that Stein scholarship has developed since 1996, moreover, has especially vexed
          the question of what it means to see politics in Stein’s poetics. Wanda Van Dusen’s
            "outing"<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e881">[7]</a> of the full text of Stein’s introduction to a
          series of translations that she made of Vichy leader Phillipe (Maréchal) Pétain’s speeches
          in the early 1940s, for instance, occasions a reconsideration of the ways in which Stein
          criticism has been polarized by the political and theoretical investments in her writing
          experiments. Van Dusen’s paper, published in <cite class="title italic">Modernism/
            Modernity</cite> in 1996, focuses on Stein’s glorification of Pêtain in terms of
          American historical figures; Van Dusen reads Stein’s "Introduction" to his speeches as an expression of fascist leanings and
          nationalist essentialism, which challenges positionings of Stein as a theorist of
            "anti-patriarchal" poetics. Van Dusen’s Stein writes in thrall to
          reified images of the national leader, for whom she willingly erases any trace of her
          Jewish and lesbian identity, and whom she allows to eclipse her antipatriarchal poetics in
          a fetishized image of the masculine war hero.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">As Van Dusen’s paper implies, it is almost as difficult to account for these radically
          different Steins, presented by the juxtaposition of the author of <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite> and that of the "Introduction," as it
          is to broach the distance between those who would redeem modernism’s revolutionary
          authoritarianism by dressing Stein in anti-patriarchal poetics and those who would prefer
          to anatomize her work as an example of the anti-Semitic, racist, imperialist modernism of
          a privileged woman obsessed with authority. Invoking the "presymbolic"
          or the "choral" disruption of the symbolic register, then,
          circumscribes Stein’s writing with a formula in which mobile, disembodied words that act
          to dissipate the sense of subjective presence in the text are equated with a certain
          degree of freedom or agency. This renders a nuanced analysis of her political investments
          problematic at best.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Barbara Will, who entered the conversation on Stein’s Vichy
            "collaboration" in 2004, considers the alarming passivity of the
          translations themselves as the sign of Stein’s recognition of the <em class="emph">failure</em> of
          writing to assure a space of subjective agency ("riant" or otherwise).
          The literal renderings of French syntactical constructions which Will highlights in
          manuscripts of the translations attest, she argues, to a passivity implying the defeat of
          Stein’s <em class="term">genius</em> and a reluctant submission to an overpowering figure of
          authority (as opposed to the fetishistic celebration Van Dusen describes).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">In 1999, John Whittier-Ferguson had made a stronger challenge to the portrait of Stein as
          the fascist mouthpiece swooning in the presence of French figures of authority. He claimed
          that Van Dusen assimilates the identity politics of the 1990s to the political climate in
          which Stein wrote, committing the same conceptual archaism characteristic of the fascist
          ideology she perceives inscribed in Stein’s "Introduction."
          Whittier-Ferguson would remind Van Dusen of the complex political landscape in the moment
          of French history in which Stein was ensconced, and he suggests that this complexity
          entails a meditation, prior to evaluation, on the different valence that the critical
          category of "politics" possesses for Stein’s historical moment compared
          with that of a student like Van Dusen.<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e930">[8]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">In her reading of the introduction to the translated speeches of Marechal Pétain, Van
          Dusen sees Stein’s expression of national affiliation as reified and essentialized; Will
          and Whittier-Ferguson would like to comprehend her relationship to
            "nation" as a more complicated condition of her writing during the
          forties. Building upon their inquiries, the analysis that follows suggests that Stein’s
          last memoir expresses the complicated condition of deriving meaning at a time in which not
          only national identity but also modernity itself became tenuous ontological categories. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">The daily experience of living through World War II, with its unpredictable
          disappearances, incessantly shifting political boundaries, and increasingly prominent
          aural communications media (especially radio), destabilizes the structures of the material
          and cognitive environment in which Stein writes. Following Whittier-Ferguson’s continued
          work on Stein’s war writings, I agree that war must be understood as a conscious factor in
          Stein’s compositional theories and practices. One does not do enough merely to take war as
          a crucial <em class="emph">context</em> for Stein’s work. When reading her essay "Paris, France" (1940), for example, one must grasp that for Stein,
              <blockquote><p>… the phenomenon of war is a manifestation and a crucial
              cause of the excitements and horrors of modernity. These excitements and horrors are
              as much aesthetic and ontological as they are sociopolitical and military. And in her
              intimate conjoining of the relations of war and art, Stein displays her modernity
              every bit as much as she does in her gnostic, avant-garde writings. [<a class="ref" href="#whittier2001">Whittier-Ferguson 2001</a>, 406–7]</p></blockquote> Similarly, <cite class="title italic">Wars I
            have Seen</cite> comprises an "intimate conjoining of the relations
            of war and art" which, like her more "gnostic,
            avant-garde" experiments, seeks to divine and represent the mechanisms and
          processes by which the mind forms like a pearl around the grain of the word. But the
          experiences which Stein records in this memoir reveal that it is no longer simply art and
          words that circulate in unpredictable oscillations of pattern and randomness; rather, the
          categories by which one might define oneself during war — enemy, ally, American, French,
          German — begin to quake and crumble into pieces which Stein reconstructs into a network of
          significations and identities which admit of no rest, no comfort, no essences, only
          encounters with possibilities of meaning which can be neither anticipated nor stabilized.
          Departing from Whittier-Ferguson, however, I believe that Stein ceases simply to "display[] her modernity"; in <cite class="title italic">Wars</cite>,
          Stein calls modernity itself into question.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Wars Stein Has Seen</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">By the time Stein wrote of her experiences in World War II, she had already interpolated
          war into her theory of the modern "composition" and its expression in
          the writing of the period. The First World War had accelerated the literary and artistic
          modernist revolution and had created conditions of aesthetic appreciation such that, as
          Stein said in her interwar lecture, "Composition as
            Explanation" (1926): <blockquote><p>...we who created the expression of
              the modern composition were to be recognized before we were dead….And so war may be
              said to have advanced a general recognition of the expression of the contemporary
              composition by almost thirty years. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#stein1990">#stein1990</a></span></p></blockquote> War, that is, participated in the phenomenological
          production of "the contemporary composition." It is important
          to note that, by "composition," Stein signifies not how one
          sees the world or what there is <em class="emph">out there</em> to be seen, but rather "what <em class="emph">is</em> seen." During World War I, as Stein explains,
          disillusionment with an older faith in reason and progress modulated knowledge production
          and accelerated epistemic change such that those "who created the
            expression of the modern composition" would gain recognition in their
          lifetimes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">But if Stein’s 1926 lecture demonstrates the modern composition in terms of the
          systematic, rational process of "explanation," her 1945 memoir
          demonstrates it in terms of the unpredictable, shifting knowledge and experience she
          accrues during her peregrinations through occupied France. Just as her prose poetry in
            <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite> would work to foreground the conventions of
          sense-making by maximizing the indeterminacy of any particular object or description,
          Stein’s prose in <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have Seen</cite> puts pressure on
          conventional temporalities and "certain" knowledge. She writes,
              <blockquote><p>…when I was a baby and then on to fourteen, the nineteenth
              century was full on. In the nineteenth century, there was reading, there was
              evolution, there was war and anti-war which was the same thing, and there was
              eating. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 17]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">Stein appears here to characterize time in terms of linear movements; she seems to say
          that the nineteenth century was a time when evolution came into vogue and sentiment about
          war was utterly conflicted. But that "there was eating"<em class="emph">then</em> inserts into this equation a practice which, the reader suspects, cannot
          be temporally bound. For, though Stein may wish to emphasize here the intermittent
          scarcity of certain foods<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e1037">[9]</a> in occupied
          France, could there <em class="emph">not</em> be "eating" in the
          twentieth century? Indeed, by imbuing this temporal construction of the nineteenth century
          with the quotidian narrative of her personal history (which includes unremarkable habits
          like eating), Stein destabilizes the very temporal grounds on which she proposes to stand.
          She continues, <blockquote><p>When I was then I liked revolutions I liked to eat
              I liked to eat I liked to cry not in real life but in books in real life there was
              nothing much to cry about but in books dear me, it was wonderful there was so much to
              cry about and then there was evolution. Evolution was all over my childhood, walks
              abroad with an evolutionist and the world was full of evolution, biological and
              botanical evolution, with music as a background for emotion and books as reality, and
              a great deal of fresh air as a necessity, and a great deal of eating as an excitement
              and as an orgy…. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 17]</p></blockquote> Stein connects emotional affect, geopolitical
          movement, scientific materialism, and aesthetic appreciation in a narrative that conflates
          the particular with the universal in a hybridization of nature and culture, bodies and
          textualities. Scientific paradigms determined what she saw and enjoyed as a child, when
            "the world was full of evolution"; books, music, and walking
          in the "fresh air" constituted her encounters with the "real" world of narrative and emotion; and food was merely a
          diversion.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">The nineteenth century ends, moreover, not according to the dictates of conventional
          chronology, but rather, when the aestheticist worldview, which it represents for Stein, is
            "killed" by war: The world comprising "music as a background for emotion and books as a reality" is both Stein’s
          childhood and the 19th century ("It was all that between babyhood and
            fourteen"), both of which, she suggests, have lived on borrowed time ever since:
              "[T]he nineteenth century dies hard all centuries do that is
              why the last war to kill it is so long, it is still being killed now in 1942…" [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 16]. The war kills the century in part by forcing
          Stein to see how modernity in the 19th century comprised two practices: one that mingles
          science, literature, and human bodies, and one that sublimates all three into a
          developmental phase of the modern human subject.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">Though she mobilizes war to describe the anachronous temporal rift between the nineteenth
          and twentieth centuries, Stein also exposes the mutability of the narratives underwriting
          geopolitical military goals. The twentieth century begins, that is, when the global access
          of information through radio, undermines the narrative seduction of territorial conquest
          along with the idea of <em class="term">progress</em> which it entailed. For Stein, there was
              <blockquote><p>nothing more interesting in the nineteenth century than
              little by little realizing the detail of natural selection in insects flowers and
              birds and butterflies and comparing things and animals and noticing protective
              coloring nothing more interesting, and this made the nineteenth century what it is,
              the white man’s burden, the gradual domination of the globe as piece by piece by piece
              it became known and became all of a piece, and the hope of Esperanto or a universal
              language. Now they can do the radio in so many languages that nobody any longer dreams
              of a single language, and there should not any longer be dreams of conquest because
              the globe is all one, anybody can hear everything and everybody can hear the same
              thing so what is the use of conquering, and so the nineteenth century now in ’43 is
              slowly coming to an end. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 17]</p></blockquote> If the evolutionary goal of comprehending the
          variation and "speciation" of living organisms constituted the
          nineteenth-century narrative girding aesthetic appreciation and territorial exploration to
          the projects of imperial expansion and colonial conquest, "there
            should not any longer be dreams of conquest because the globe is all one."
          Stein’s assessment of the causes of war may be naïve, however, by exposing this naiveté
          she implicates herself in an intellectual movement which sought evidence of a universal
          notion of humanity in deep structures; Freud’s unconscious, for instance, can be seen as a
          psychological Esperanto, a structure embedded within the mind which could facilitate an
          understanding of the processes and affects of every individual <em class="emph">on equal
          terms</em>. "Now" that "they can do the
            radio in so many languages," Stein writes, such deep structures have disappeared
          from the scientific and artistic narratives of the slowly-awakening twentieth century.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">If Stein displays translations between science, war, technology, and social experience,
          she does so to expose the absence of a new, 20th-century, narrative of purification.
          Without the ability to assimilate the goals of scientists, armies, and individuals into a
          single "human" category, Stein cannot maintain a sense of being modern.
          Rather, as she suggests by asking "anybody can hear everything and
            everybody can hear the same thing so what is the use of conquering[?]," the
          natural correspondence between science, war, and technology no longer holds up to
          scrutiny. War persists, even as she writes and despite anything the nineteenth century
          taught her. Thus, the first feat Stein accomplishes within her memoir is to introduce her
          reader to the twentieth century, characterized as a temporality without a story.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Stein exposes her version of the 19th-century master narrative (that progress and
          discovery will lead to Utopian civilization) to highlight its insufficiency as a way to
          represent or understand the unpredictable cultural and political circumstances of World
          War II. To compensate for this insufficiency, Stein, in the manner of James Joyce’s <cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite> (1922), invokes tropes of history and subjective
          development to characterize the present moment. She supports the chronological convention
          of the memoir by organizing her meditations on war according to successive periods in her
          life (hence, for instance, the above refrain "when I was a baby and
            then on to fourteen..."); but whereas the first few pages of the narrative appear
          grounded in the periodizing construct of the individual’s phases of life, the relative
          distance between past and present soon collapses under the pressure of Stein’s need to
          make sense of what she sees during World War II. The grounding construct of her narrative
          thus begins to look less clear. She writes, <blockquote><p>Mediaeval means, that
              life and place and the crops you plant and your wife and children, all are
              uncertain….And now and here, it is like that, you take a train, you disappear, you
              move away your house is gone, your children too, your crops are taken away….So at
              fifteen there comes to be a realization of what living was in mediaeval times and as a
              pioneer. It is very near. And now in 1943 it is here….And here and now in 1943, now
              that the war is coming to an end, everybody that is nobody knows whether there is or
              is not any future and at fifteen it is like that everybody and nobody knows whether
              there is or is not any future. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 26, 8]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37"> The "uncertain" state of being "mediaeval" characterizes both the present moment, in which people and things can
          vanish unaccountably. But it also characterizes the adolescent period in which everything
          is new and unknown to one, as to a "pioneer." Stein subverts
          the narrative construct which gives priority to past experiences when describing present
          ones –the fifteen-year-old "realization of what living was in
            mediaeval times" is now "here" in 1943 — by bringing
          two stories so "very near" that what stands out most clearly
          amid the uncertainty of both present and future is the rhyme "near/here." That is, by looping back to the experience of uncertainty "at fifteen," Stein’s meditations on the present yield no further
          knowledge but lead her into an incessant cycle of reflexivity. In essence, Stein offers
          her reader a modernist narrative with a difference: She does not deploy deep history
          simply to create an encyclopedic frame for modern experience, but again shows how living
          through the war in occupied territory has undermined her ability to see the 20th century
          as a modern phenomenon.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">Like many of her contemporaries who were experimenting with narrative form, Stein worked
          against the grain of received genres. Without a narrative form capable of
            "purifying" the admixtures of scientific and military interests,
          historical and personal temporalities, Stein’s memoir devolves into mainly a string of
          anecdotal stories about the direction of the war and the shape of the postwar world. But
          instead of submitting completely to the whimsical narrative hybrids of the contemporary
          composition, she punctuates the rumor and speculation with compensatory passages that
          exude strong (albeit spurious) certainty. For example, Stein’s narrative erupts into a
          strangely conclusive meditation on the uniqueness of national aesthetics. Deprived of
          letters and newspapers, she observes what she can about the world beyond her remote
          village in the Rhone Valley by tuning into her wireless. As if having found a new medium
          on which to base an expression of her present moment, she renders the cultural imprint
          that each nation leaves in its broadcast announcement: <blockquote><p>The
              English always begin with Here is London, or the BBC home service, or the overseas
              service, always part of a pleasant home life, of supreme importance to any English man
              or any English woman. The Americans say with poetry and fire, This is the Voice of
              America, and then with modesty and good neighborliness, one of the United Nations, it
              is the voice of America speaking to you across the Atlantic. Then the Frenchman say,
              Frenchman [sic] speaking to Frenchmen, they always begin like that, and the Belgians
              are simple and direct, they just announce, radio Belge, and the national anthem, and
              the Frenchman [sic] also say, Honor and Country, and the Swiss so politely say, the
              studio of Geneva, at the instant of the broadcasting station of Berne will give you
              the latest news, and Italy says live Mussolini live Italy, and they make a bird noise
              and then they start, and Germany starts like this, Germany calling, Germany

          she writes, <blockquote><p>In the last war I said that the camouflage was the

              camouflage, but in this war it is the heading of the broadcast that makes national
              life so complete and determined. It is that a nation is even stronger than the
              personality of anyone, it certainly is so nations must go on, they certainly
              must. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 155–6]</p></blockquote> Reading the passage as printed, one notices
          a punctuational pattern: two complete sentences broken into thirds by commas. Despite the
          punctuational symmetry, the second sentence sounds rushed and lacks the logic and clarity
          of the first. However the second-to-last clause is read ("it certainly
            is/so nations must go on" or "it certainly is so/nations must
            go on" or "it certainly is so [that] nations must go
            on"), the reader hears a fanatical enthusiasm for the overpowering strength of
          national identity.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">Though omitting punctuation is not uncommon for Stein, who is known for deliberately
          leaving syntax indeterminate, we might read her failure to indicate a pause here, before
          the phrases "a nation is" and "so nations
            must," as the creation of a voice so excited that it forgets to accent its own
          words. It speaks, that is, in a manner Stein had come to know as
            "hysterical" during her days studying under the tutelage of
          psychologist William James. James based his theory of <em class="term">split personality</em> on
          Pierre Janet’s conception of hysteria — namely "the disintegration of
            ideas and functions, which, when united, form the personal consciousness" — and
          remained Stein’s mentor for years after she left Harvard Annex and then Johns Hopkins
          medical school. According to the study on Normal Motor Automatism that Stein published in
          the late nineties, hysteria is a disease of "attention"[<a class="ref" href="#solomons1896">Solomons &amp; Stein 1896</a>, 502]. She
          and her colleague Leon Solomons had concluded that a "large number of
            acts ordinarily called intelligent, such as reading, writing, etc. can go on quite
            automatically in ordinary people" when adequately distracted. Such automatism or
            "non-voluntary" activity was often monotonous and marked by
          its "perfect ease…smoothness…perfect characterlessness, and
              unaccented pencil movement" [<a class="ref" href="#solomons1896">Solomons &amp; Stein 1896</a>, 508]. The second, "unaccented," sentence of Stein’s passage on nations performs this hysterical
          logic, in which the excitement of realizing <em class="emph">what</em> makes nations so "complete and determined" — or perhaps <em class="emph">that</em> they seem
          to be thus — draws the subject’s attention away from the act of representing her thoughts. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Polarizations of national identity, Stein shows us, are entailed upon the contemporary
          composition (the international network) no less than they were before the globe was "all one." Indeed, the instability of national identity amid the
          dynamic international network of the 1940s becomes the dominant theme of the remainder of
            <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have Seen</cite>. The Stein who waxes with "hysterical" impassivity about the strength, endurance, and
          determination (or determinacy) of nations is also the Stein who sees how the war has
          created shifting, international, political and economic networks.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">The "bipolar" manner in which Stein deals with the value of
          national identity in the latter pages of her memoir echoes the kind of concerns she had
          expressed in a series of short essays in 1936 (see "Money,""More about Money,""Still More about Money,""All about Money," and "My Last about
            Money," collected in <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#stein">#stein</a></span>) about the value of an
          even more abstract concept: money. In fact, her concerns over the value of money resurface
          in <cite class="title italic">Wars I Have Seen</cite>. But in contrast to the speculative
          manner of her 1936 essays, her thoughts on money in the spring of 1944<a class="noteRef" href="#d29916e1265">[11]</a> come across as "determined" as the nations she
          hears in the radio broadcasts. Recounting a conversation she had with a friend about
            "after war, and the future organization of the world," Stein
          writes, <blockquote><p>...I realized suddenly and completely, that really gold
              has almost a religious quality it really has and that this is the reason it is always
              the standard of money, it has to be. The reason why is this, it is the only metal in
              the world that is of no use.... It is really marvelous that the only metal in all this
              world of ours that is absolutely entirely and completely useless is gold, and
              therefore it must have the mystic quality of aloofness which makes which always will
              make it the standard of money. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 181]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">Even if Stein had not directly read or heard the news of the upcoming international
          monetary summit that would take place at Bretton Woods, it is hard to believe that neither
          she nor the interlocutor with whom she discusses gold have gathered some sense of the
          debate about the planned postwar currency stabilization. American newspapers during the
          spring of 1944 were rife with rhetoric about the proposed rehabilitation of the U.S. gold
          standard. One <cite class="title italic">New York Times</cite> columnist wrote, <blockquote><p>The greatest single contribution that the United States could make to
              world currency stability after the war would be to declare its determination to
              stabilize its own currency...It could do this by balancing the budget and by
              announcing that the dollar was no longer on a "twenty-four-hour
                basis," and subject to every rumor, but firmly anchored to a fixed quantity
              of gold. [<a class="ref" href="#hazlitt1944">Hazlitt 1944</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Stein, like the <cite class="title italic">Times</cite> columnist, is "completely" convinced that gold must be the standard of money. Stein’s "religious" appeal to gold’s "mystic quality of
            aloofness," and her causal fallacy (gold is the "only metal
            in all this world of ours that is absolutely entirely and completely useless,"
          and so it must always be the standard of money), moreover, voices the kind of economic
          rumor that the gold "anchor," according to the <cite class="title italic">Times</cite>, would silence. Stein’s punctuationally hysterical desire to
          believe in the quality "which makes which will always make [gold] the
            standard of money," in fact, mirrors the leap of faith that government advisors
          were taking to advocate the rehabilitation of an international economy based on the U.S.
          gold standard. Making his bid for the gold standard before the House Foreign Affairs
          Committee, Princeton University professor Edwin Walter Kemmerer admitted that the gold
          standard had not truly been tested since 1914 even as he "declared that no other currency system would so quickly restore public confidence in
              the post-war world..." [<a class="ref" href="#times1944">Times 1944</a>]. Like Kemmerer and other
          contemporary advocates of the gold standard, Stein desires a vision of postwar stability;
          yet Stein’s hysterical wish to believe in the gold standard, like her intermittent
          conviction about the power of nations, represents her narrative disorientation in a
          century that has yet to reveal to her a story productive of stable social meaning.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">As Stein records her daily life following the landing of American troops on French soil,
          her experiences indeed challenge the "complete" and "determined," abstracted nation depicted in the particularity of the
          radio broadcast; the social and political network through which she circulates in occupied
          France frenetically switches on and off not only Stein’s national, but also religious
          identity. When Stein first hears of the "landing," she records
          her excitement, marking the day with a fairly tenuous verbal suture: "Well that was yesterday and to-day is the landing and we heard
              Eisenhower tell us he was here they were here…and we are singing hallelujah, and
              feeling very nicely, and everybody has been telephoning to us congratulatory
              messages…" [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 194]. Stein’s distracted conflation of Eisenhower
          and the troops confirms, even while it begins to fragment, the hysterical abstraction of
          the nations she hears in the radio broadcast –indeed Eisenhower’s radio announcement
          forces Stein to <em class="emph">conjugate</em> the message in the singular and plural
          third-persons, respectively. Similarly, Stein’s ability to identify with the abstract
            "voice" of America begins to fracture as the troops draw
          inland. Stein considers the shortsightedness of the American troops who, having forwarded
          the request via the Swiss consul, wish to profile the population of her village, with a
          moiety of both indignance and amusement: <blockquote><p>We giggled and said that
              is optimism. Naturally American authorities, not really realizing what it is to live
              in an occupied country, ask you to put down your religion your property and its value,
              as if anybody would as long as Germans are in the country and in a position to take
              letters and read them if they want to. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 200]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">The "optimism" at which Stein and Toklas "giggle" denies Stein the sense of miraculous safety the initial reports of their
          landing had represented ("…we are singing hallelujah, and feeling very
            nicely…"). What strikes Stein as a funny sort of optimism illustrates the
          network’s power to switch on her national identity while switching off her Jewish
          identity.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">The local scale of Stein’s experiences, moreover, imperils even the global network’s
          vouchsafing of her ability to identify as American. To be sure, the American military
          forces have not yet made their way to her region of the countryside at this point in the
          narrative, and the fear of occupying German troops remains strong. The threat of German
          troops merges with the sense of safety promised by the imminent approach of the Americans
          during one of Stein’s encounters. On one of the many long walks which she records, Stein
          finds herself approached by a French woman who asks her about a package that her husband
          has found dropped, presumably by a war-plane passing by. Stein recognizes the item in
          question as a package of malted milk tablets and narrates the ensuing exchange:
              <blockquote><p>…I told her and she said is it good and I said yes for
              children have you some and she said yes she had two, well I said eat one yourself and
              if it is good give it to them it will do them good, I suggested that she try it first,
              because I thought it might be something bad that the Germans had put out to discourage
              the people with gifts from America. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 219]</p></blockquote> Stein moves quickly from identifying the malt
          tablets as safe American edibles to suspecting them of being found war loot, poisoned by
          the Germans and dropped on the ground to carry out a kind of bio-terrorism based on fear
          tactics. Her suspicion sabotages another opportunity to imagine both the American troops
          and herself as bearers of safety. The possession of a national product, which in this case
          would endow Stein with a sense of national agency, is confounded by the awareness that
          even the values of indigenous consumables have become compromised in by the war.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">While Stein can momentarily afford to question the salubriousness of American "goods," she notes how her fellow French villagers cannot. Following
          shortly upon her encounter with the malt tablets, Stein recounts her conversation with an
          old man who said he had seen a lot of American airplanes flying by that day. She writes,
              <blockquote><p>...yes he said reflectively leaning on his farming implement
              and I leaning on my cane, yes he said, we depend on America to pick us up out of our
              troubles, we have always been friends we helped them when they needed us and they
              helped us when we needed them, the English are all right but it is America that we
              count on to take care of us to see we keep our colonies, to be sure they will want
              naval stations and of course we will be pleased to have them have them. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 221]</p></blockquote> Despite Stein’s desire to mirror the old man,
          he "leaning on his farming implement and I leaning on my cane,"
          her encounter switches back on her American identity. To be American in the current
          modulation of the political and economic network, moreover, means to possess monetary
          resources capable of stabilizing a fragmenting colonial, international economy. The desire
          to believe in the "complete" and "determined" quality of not only America, but also its economic robustness, has
          been transferred to the old man who has co-opted Stein’s desire to see American currency
          anchored by gold.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">Stein’s imagined co-optations of American products and anxieties (respectively, the malt
          tablets and the resurrected gold standard) foreshadow a scene that replays her uncanny
          orientation toward American identity. For, after the Americans have finally arrived in the
          region, Stein has returned to meditating on the differences and similarities between what
          she has seen in this war as compared with the last. And, now that the American army is in
          town, Stein begins a series of musings on what makes this army distinct not from the other
          national armies but, rather, from the American army which she saw in the last world war.
          Entrusted with the job of chaperoning the daughter of a French friend to meet the American
          soldiers, Stein again finds herself positioned to be the bearer of a distinctly American
          experience. The little girl in question has been praying every night to meet an American
          soldier and her mother asks Stein to help answer her daughter’s prayers. Stein gladly
          accepts her charge and, in considering the gift of chewing gum which Stein sees the
          soldiers give the little girl, records how proud she is that, in their particular
          sweetness toward children, this army is no different than the last. Yet upon cautioning
          the child to make sure only to chew but not to swallow the gum — for she would not, Stein
          guesses, be familiar with the peculiarly American product — Stein experiences a modulation
          of her own identity. For the little girl replies, <blockquote><p>Oh yes I
              know…How do you know that I asked oh she said because when there was the last war my
              mother was a little girl and the American soldiers gave her chewing gum and all
              through this war my mother used to tell us about it, and she gave a rapturous sigh and
              said and now I have it. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 254]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">In reproducing the kindness to children that had constituted Stein’s impression of the
          last American army, the soldiers of WWII inadvertently spoil Stein’s opportunity to
          represent herself as the bearer of a distinctly American product and experience. Thus, the
          story she would tell herself <em class="emph">about</em> herself as an American is subverted by a
          story passed down from mother to daughter, a generation which parallels the second
          generation of world war in the twentieth century. Indeed, Stein’s elision of the interwar
          period in describing the way in which the nineteenth century was slowly being "killed" from 1914 on proves a suitable transgression of
          conventional historical chronology; for the uncanny encounter with a deracinated cultural
          product, which Stein records here, had already, in a sense, been prescribed in the French
          mother’s "American experience" instantiated when she was a
          child in the first war and reproduced in her child during the second.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">Stein closes her memoir with yet another performance of the desire to maintain a stable
          sense of national identity and a temporal partition between the past and the present. She
          meditates on what makes the soldiers of this war so different than those of the last, and
          in her last words she parodies the very notions of national determinacy and modernity that
          lured her into the untenable narratives she has attempted in vain to construct for
          herself. The American soldiers of this war, she notes, are interesting, optimistic, show a
          marked curiosity for new knowledge, whereas their World War I counterparts had been, to
          her view, rather dull, given to excessive drink, and suspicious of foreign habits. One of
          Stein’s French acquaintances suggests that it must be the cinema that has made them "men of the world." Some of the soldiers themselves suggest that it
          is the radio (and especially the quiz shows) that convinced them that they might as well
          be intelligent rather than dull. Still others cite the country’s bold emergence from the
          depression as the source of their sureness, conversational savvy, and urbane poise. Stein,
          however, offers her own theory of what has produced the difference. She decides that the
          salient factor in understanding what makes these Americans "so
            complete and determined," and so distinct from their predecessors, is their
          belated possession of a unique national language. As if to explain, Stein writes,
              <blockquote><p>I think of the Americans of the last war, they had their
              language but they were not yet in possession of it, and the children of the depression
              as that generation called itself it was beginning to possess its language and in
              dominating their language which is now all theirs they have ceased to be adolescents
              and have become men…they have become more American all American, and the G.I. Joes
              show it and know it, God bless them. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1984">Stein 1984</a>, 259]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">Reducing the distinctness of "Americans," and particularly
          those of <em class="emph">this war</em>, to linguistic phenomena, Stein mocks her very attempt to
          preserve nationality and modernity as absolute categories. Without being able to offer her
          reader a new narrative paradigm for the slowly awakening "20th
            century," Stein again exposes the insufficiency of the "19th-century" narrative paradigm. While conquest and "domination" provided the previous century with a way to purify the hybridized
          techno-scientific and military cultures of Europe and America into a single "human"<span class="foreign i"><em class="emph">agon</em></span>, Stein ultimately discovers that
          nationality and modernity, in the "contemporary composition"
          are all-together trickier and more transitory categories than they were for the "19th century." If Stein’s relationship to chewing gum, malt
          tablets, and gold are any indication, the GIs will not be able to "possess" their new "All American" language
          absolutely.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53">But does Stein leave the 20th century nothing but a deconstructed 19th century? No. By
          recording the bipolar relationship between identity and an ever shifting network of
          international political and economic interests, Stein gives her reader a glimpse of the
          mode of social production of meaning that would come to dominate the late 20th and early
          21st centuries. Her very failure to devise a story that could cognitively partition the
          practices of international and temporal hybridization from those of purification,
          moreover, signals the passing of a modernist paradigm. If we return to one of Stein’s 1936
          essays on money — again, I suggest that Stein’s concerns over the value of money are
          symptomatic of the author’s broader anxieties about globalization and cultural change — we
          learn that, even before the outbreak of World War II, Stein sees a paradigmatic narrative
          shift on the global horizon. Noting a contemporary tendency to value the machinery of
          industrialism over free will and thought, Stein writes, <blockquote><p class="ptext">That
                is the logical end of organization and that is where the world is today, the
                beginning of the eighteenth century went in for freedom and ended in the beginning
                of the nineteenth century that went in for organization.</p><p class="ptext">Now organization is getting kind of used up.</p><p class="ptext">The virgin lands are getting kind of used up, the whole surface of the world is

                again. [<a class="ref" href="#stein1974">Stein 1974</a>]</p></blockquote> Stein could sense that <em class="term">organization</em>, the
          word she uses to represent the homogenizing and systematizing practices characteristic of
          19th-century progress, was becoming an outmoded narrative paradigm. Only her personal
          record of daily life during the next war in occupied France, however, would reveal that to
            "begin again" meant sacrificing a stable sense of nationality
          and modernity to the network narrative.</div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d29916e234"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>Regarding concern in the labor market, one

            Stein’s controversial translation work for Vichy leader Marshal Phillipe Petain, Barbara
            Will argues that the "emergence of a public audience" for
            Stein’s writing after the publication of <cite class="title italic">The Autobiography of Alice
              B. Toklas</cite> (1932) can help account for what appears, in the utterly "passive" syntax of the translations, to be Stein’s shift away
            from her "complex sense of 'genius'
                as a guiding aesthetic principle" [<a class="ref" href="#will2004">Will 2004</a>, 657].</div><div class="endnote" id="d29916e714"><span class="noteRef">[5]</span>This
            accusation was particularly cutting because Skinner was essentially accusing Stein of
            exhibiting a condition she had studied and described in experiments she published with
            Leon M. Solomons in 1896 under the guidance of eminent psychologist, and her mentor,
            William James. In her work on normal motor automatism, Stein described a behavior that
            would come to be known as "automatic writing." However, Stein not
            only denied that she wrote in this mode but also claimed such writing to be impossible.
            Unlike Solomons, Stein did not believe in automatic writing: "There are automatic movements but not automatic writing. Writing for the normal
                person is too complicated an activity to be indulged in automatically" [<a class="ref" href="#meyer2001">Meyer 2001</a>, 221].</div><div class="endnote" id="d29916e825"><span class="noteRef">[6]</span>Lisa Ruddick reads <cite class="title italic">Tender Buttons</cite>

            the crucial fault in Van Dusen’s "materialist" analysis,
            Whittier-Ferguson writes, "…the very familiarity of Stein's
                failings to Van Dusen — and the utter familiarity of the terms in which Van Dusen
                finds fault with Stein — ...betray Van Dusen's by no means uncommon abridgment of
                time's passing….The political ruler Van Dusen applies to Stein is calibrated for
                1996: 'politics' is a practice that begins and ends with
                a forthright assertion of one's identity and involves a careful measuring of one's
                socioeconomic, racial, and sexual positions vis-à-vis the dominant sociopolitical
                order…. Even before we turn to Pétain and Stein, we should understand that being a
                Jew in occupied France, rather than encouraging a public declaration of solidarity
                with marginalized populations or recriminations against France's puppet government,
                would have been more likely to encourage Stein in her longstanding preference for
                avoiding risky, public, political stands" [<a class="ref" href="#whittier2001">Whittier-Ferguson 2001</a>, 118].</div><div class="endnote" id="d29916e1037"><span class="noteRef">[9]</span>Foods like butter and sugar were unavailable to Stein and

            argument that <cite class="title italic">Wars</cite> is more than a daily journal since the fact remains that Stein did
