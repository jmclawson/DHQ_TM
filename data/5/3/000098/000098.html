          nostalgic reimagining of the supposedly embodied, personal or creative aspects of earlier
          writing technologies, including handwriting. Although handwriting was never a fully
          embodied writing technology, critics of transparent computer graphics often characterize
          it as such. This revisionist nostalgia for handwriting is evident not only in critical
          literature but also in contemporary graphical media such as video games.</p><p>Two recent Nintendo DS games, <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> (2009) and
            <cite class="title italic">The World Ends with You</cite> (2007), represent two alternative
          modalities of such nostalgia for handwriting. <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>
          claims to fully restore the creative properties of handwriting, but inevitably fails to do
          so. By contrast, <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> claims to offer not handwriting itself
          but a digital- and DS-specific equivalent. Therefore, it opens up possibilities for
          critical reflection on the past meaning of handwriting and on the future of the values
          that handwriting has come to symbolize. </p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In this essay I discuss two recent Nintendo DS games, <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> (2009) and <cite class="title italic">The World Ends with You</cite>
          (2007), as examples of nostalgic fantasies of handwriting. Nostalgia for handwriting, and
          more generally for the materiality of older media in general, is a common trope in
          contemporary discussions of medial change. However, such discussions often understand
          older media as being more fully material than is in fact the case. When this assumption is
          not challenged, it leads to attempts to recapture the materiality of older media using the
          tools of new media — attempts which inevitably fail, as my discussion of <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> will show. On the other hand, in my discussion of
            <cite class="title italic">The World Ends with You</cite>, we will see that nostalgia for the
          materiality of older media can also be mobilized productively: such nostalgia can prompt a
          critical examination of the question of why materiality is desired in the first place.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Materiality has emerged as a key issue in many recent discussions of digital media and
          its relation to older media.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e121">[1]</a> While materiality
          is a notoriously slippery concept, for the present purposes I will define it, adapting
          Johanna Drucker, as the physical, embodied substrate of a sign — as those aspects of a
          sign which are excessive to its signifying value. For Drucker, any sign involves
              "two major intertwined strands: that of a relational,
              insubstantial, and nontranscendent difference and that of a phenomenological,
              apprehendable, immanent substance" [<a class="ref" href="#drucker1997">Drucker 1997</a>, 43]. For example, any given instance of a
          printed letter Q can be understood either from the viewpoint of its semantic value or from
          that of its material aspects, such as its typographic properties, the type of ink used to
          print it, and the material substrate on which it is printed. These latter features are
          surplus to the signifying value of the letter — a Q is still understood as the "same"
          letter when any or all of the above-named features are altered, within certain limits —
          but they connect the letter to the cultural context from which it emerges.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The introduction of digital technology inaugurates a crisis for traditional models of
          materiality. In pre-digital media, the connection between material and signifying aspects
          of a sign is unbreakable; any printed, painted, or handwritten sign is literally
          inseparable from its physical support and its material properties. Digital technology is
          often understood, however, as introducing a gap between these properties of the sign, such
          as by separating what Matthew Kirschenbaum calls <em class="term">formal materiality</em> (briefly,
          what a sign looks like) from forensic materiality (what it actually consists of) [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>, 9–10]. Digital technologies like virtual reality and
          video games are therefore often criticized as disembodying the sign or as unmooring it
          from its materiality. Casey Alt, for example, notes that "Virtual
              Reality has signified for most critics a superficial doubling of surface reality that
              privileges visuality in such a way as to more strongly foster an eye-mind link that
              has little, if anything, to do with the particular materialities of human
              embodiment" [<a class="ref" href="#alt2002">Alt 2002</a>, 387], although he goes on to significantly
          complicate this claim.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">At stake in such polemics over materiality is the question of what happens to the
            <em class="emph">embodied self</em> when changes occur in the technological tools whereby that
          self communicates itself to the world. Older media technologies — photographic film and
          movable type, for example — may be understood (at least naïvely) as being embodied in the
          same way that human beings are, as having something "to do with the
            particular materialities of human embodiment." By virtue of their embodied
          nature, analog and mechanical technologies seem to osmotically absorb the idiosyncratic
          properties of the embodied self that uses them. The supplantation of such technologies by
          digital technologies may thus be understood as a supplantation of the embodied self. The
          link between embodiment and selfhood is especially strong in the case of the mechanical
          writing technology I will discuss here, <span class="hi italic">viz.</span> handwriting, and the
          fate of handwriting may be seen as an index of the fate of selfhood in the digital
          era.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Fantasies of Handwriting</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Handwriting, by definition, is evidence of the presence of the writer's body at the place
          and time of writing.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e165">[2]</a>
          Moreover, handwriting necessarily involves a certain <em class="emph">excessive</em> component not
          reducible to its signifying value. The shape, line weight, and other graphic properties of
          a given handwritten letter are necessarily present, but are not required in order to
          differentiate the letter from other letters; that is, all these properties could change,
          at least within a certain limited range, and the letter would be recognizable as the
            "same" letter. The excessive aspects of handwriting are an index of the physical
          and gestural activity of the hand that produced the letter. Because handwriting reveals
          both the fact of the writer's prior bodily presence and the idiosyncratic qualities of the
          writer's gestural movements, it is often understood in a more general sense as graphically
          embodying the writer's personality or self. For example, the nineteenth-century
          pseudoscience of graphology held that a person's character could be read from the graphic
          properties of his or her handwriting. Indeed, because this theory presupposes that people
            <em class="emph">have</em> a unique and unchangeable personality, it appealed to
          nineteenth-century Americans who were faced with the loss of other traditional grounds for
          subjectivity [<a class="ref" href="#thornton1996">Thornton 1996</a>, 109 and                     passim].
          Similarly, the Belgian comics scholar Philippe Marion uses psychoanalytic theory to argue
          that lettering is a privileged sign of the unique enunciative entity responsible for a
          comics text [<a class="ref" href="#marion1993">Marion 1993</a>]. Such theories of handwriting hold that in writing
          by hand, one creates an inscription which functions simultaneously as a trace of one's
          bodily presence and as a physical object that exists independently of oneself. According to these theories,
          in writing by hand, one literally <em class="emph">writes oneself into the world</em>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">This, however, represents not a factual account of handwriting but what I would call a
            <em class="term">fantasy of handwriting</em>, because the assignment of positive connotations of
          personality and subjectivity to handwriting is a modern invention which becomes imaginable
          only after the confrontation of handwriting with alternative writing systems. When
          handwriting was the only writing technology available to individuals, it was often an
          index of conformity, not individuality. In eighteenth-century England and America,
          handwriting was one of several arts devoted to "the faithful
              representation of one's place in society" [<a class="ref" href="#thornton1996">Thornton 1996</a>, 35]. In Victorian America, handwriting was a
          means of revealing character, but in the sense of moral uprightness, not idiosyncratic
          uniqueness. Sloppy handwriting might have connoted dishonesty and lack of character rather
          than positive unconventionality [<a class="ref" href="#thornton1996">Thornton 1996</a>, 52]. Handwriting
          historically often served to mechanize the body rather than liberating its kinesthetic
          potential; for example, the purpose of the Palmerian practice of handwriting pedagogy was
          to "[turn] the handwriter himself into a machine" capable of
          competing with assembly-line technology [<a class="ref" href="#thornton1996">Thornton 1996</a>, 177]; (see also
            [<a class="ref" href="#thornton1996">Thornton 1996</a>, 21–61 passim]).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The modern understanding of handwriting as expressive of the writer's unique character is
          therefore largely attributable to the encounter of handwriting with — and replacement of
          handwriting by — print and type. Handwriting takes on connotations of uniqueness,
          personality and embodiment precisely because of its contrast with newer technologies that
          appear to lack these connotations. For example: "The introduction
              of the typewriter, for instance, shifted the emphasis to the standardization of
              script, but it may even have increased the notion of authenticity associated with
              handwriting" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#neef2006">#neef2006</a></span>. The Arts and Crafts calligraphy revival, which
          emphasized "the characteristics which distinguish one person's
              hand from another's "qtd. in  [<a class="ref" href="#johnston1939">Johnston 1939</a>, 180–181] and
          sought "to affirm the value of human individuality" [<a class="ref" href="#thornton1996">Thornton 1996</a>, 181], explicitly critiqued the
          mechanization of handwriting by printed copybooks. At stake in fantasies of handwriting,
          then, is a certain traditional concept of the self as uniquely embodied, as irreducibly
          bound to its material instantiation. The fantasy of handwriting develops as an attempt to
          defend this concept of the self against technologies that seem to replace the material,
          bodily self with a mechanical or digital surrogate.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">However, if fantasies of handwriting do no more than lament the loss of the fully
          embodied self, they risk becoming purely nostalgic in the restorative sense.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e228">[3]</a> In order to
          be productive, fantasies of handwriting need to acknowledge that handwriting, and the self
          it connotes — a self characterized by individuality, subjectivity and embodiment — is
            <em class="emph">always already a lost object</em>. Its embodied and individualizing aspects come
          to prominence only when threatened by mechanical technology. In the absence of such
          threats, these aspects of handwriting often fell below the threshold of attention.
          Analogously, the typewriter might initially have seemed like an ominous symbol of the
          mechanization and disembodiment of writing, but when compared to the word processor, the
          typewriter may become nostalgically reenvisioned as an embodied mechanism. (As Arthur Conan
          Doyle observed, because each typewriter has a unique pattern of deterioration, typewritten
          text can be as idiosyncratic as handwriting (qtd. in [<a class="ref" href="#gitelman1999">Gitelman 1999</a>, 215]).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Fantasies of handwriting are created only in retrospect, as a product of the same process
          of technological change that renders handwriting obsolete. Therefore, these fantasies are
          based on a revisionary, imagined version of handwriting, which is not necessarily
          functionally identical to "originary" handwriting (i.e. handwriting as it existed
          before typewriting or word processing). As Svetlana Boym argues, <blockquote><p><em class="emph">The object of nostalgia is further away than it appears.</em> Nostalgia is
              never literal, but lateral. It looks sideways. It is dangerous to take it at face
              value. Nostalgic reconstruction is based on mimicry; the past is remade in the image
              of a present or a desired future, collective designs are made to resemble personal
              aspirations or vice versa. [<a class="ref" href="#boym2002">Boym 2002</a>, 354]</p></blockquote> If the introduction of digital media results
          in nostalgia for earlier writing technologies, then this nostalgia refers to objects that
          never truly existed and are constructed only retroactively. The values for which
          handwriting is cherished were not necessarily present or noticeable before handwriting had
          anything to be compared to. Therefore, nostalgia for handwriting is deeply ambivalent: it
          wishes to return to an original condition of handwriting, but knows such a return is
          already impossible as soon as the need for it is felt.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e248">[4]</a> Moreover, because fantasies
          of handwriting arise only after handwriting becomes practically obsolete, they are
          typically promulgated using the same technologies that they critique.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e251">[5]</a> In order to be honest rather than purely ludditical or
          atavistic — in order to be reflective rather than restorative, in Boym's terminology —
          fantasies of handwriting need to acknowledge the profound gap between originary and
          reenvisioned handwriting.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">For example, Sven Birkerts, a notable opponent of digital technology, observed in 1996
          that word processing destroys the commitment to truth that characterized handwriting and
          typewriting. Because correcting errors on a word processor is a trivial task, the writer
          no longer needs to think carefully before writing [<a class="ref" href="#birkerts2006">Birkerts 2006</a>, 157].
          This claim is a classic piece of revisionary nostalgia. It advocates a simple return to
          the past, ignoring the fact that such a return is no longer possible, and not least
          because the past is only constructed in light of the present. Until Birkerts used a
          writing technology that enabled him to correct errors effortlessly, he presumably didn't
          realize that difficulty in correcting errors was beneficial. In a text written ten years later, Birkerts
          admits that he has been forced to accept the use of digital technology. Though he still
          writes his first drafts in longhand, he now e-mails them to his editor, and his house is

              not letting himself form deeper ties because he believes he will one day be returning
              home" [<a class="ref" href="#birkerts2006">Birkerts 2006</a>, 234]. Yet Birkerts admits that this belief is
          not a sincere one, that he knows he can't return from the Babylonian captivity of
          computers to the Zion of manual writing. Birkerts's revised argument is an example of a
          reflective fantasy of handwriting, which acknowledges that to remember handwriting is also
          to retroactively construct it. Here the fantasy of handwriting becomes not merely a lament
          for the loss of the handwritten self, but a meditation on the conditions of possibility of
          that self.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Handwriting in Video Games</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Contemporary video games represent an important site of both restorative and reflective
          fantasies of handwriting. It seems counterintuitive that a digital technology could
          operate as a means of remediating and recollecting a manual one. Yet as alluded to above,
          fantasies of handwriting arise only due to the replacement of handwriting by more
          efficient technologies. It's therefore perhaps inevitable that these fantasies should be
          communicated by means of those technologies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Handwriting, typing and mental writing had a surprising degree of importance at the
          origins of video gaming, and their widespread replacement by graphics produces a sense of
          nostalgia for these modes of interaction. Nick Montfort reminds us that "early interaction with computers
              happened largely on paper: on paper tape, on punchcards, and on print terminals and
              teletypewriters, with their scroll-like supplies of continuous paper for printing
              output and input both" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#montfort2004">#montfort2004</a></span>. For example, Will Crowther wrote <cite class="title italic">Adventure</cite> (1975), the first text adventure game, on an ASR-33
          Teletype, an interface that preserved the embodied properties of the typewriter, and he
          may have corrected his code in pen or pencil <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#montfort2004">#montfort2004</a></span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e284">[6]</a> The
          game was created in tandem with a hand-drawn map of part of Kentucky's Mammoth Cave, which
          was based on computational line plots of data gathered by Crowther and other cavers with
          compasses and measuring tapes [<a class="ref" href="#jerz2007">Jerz 2007</a>, ¶59]. At the origin of <cite class="title italic">Adventure</cite>, and thus of a certain tradition of narrative video
          gaming, are various processes of embodied writing. Playing text adventures equally
          involves real or metaphorical writing. The text adventure game involves the exploration of
          a simulated world which is not visually depicted, so to navigate that space effectively,
          the player must develop a functional understanding of its geography and the contents of
          each of its locations. One way to do this is to imagine what the gameworld looks like.
          This process is comparable to writing or drawing because it involves the creation of a
          visual artifact (imaginary in one case, real in the other) which didn't exist before and
          which is to some extent unique to oneself.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e295">[7]</a> Another
          way to understand the gameworld visually was to map it on paper. Accordingly, hand-drawn
          and hand-annotated paper maps were an invaluable accessory to early Adventure players <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#montfort2004">#montfort2004</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Even after graphics became the norm in video games, scriptural processes
          continued to characterize their creation and reception in various ways. Ken and Roberta
          Williams's <cite class="title italic">Mystery House</cite>, the earliest graphical adventure
          game, featured vector graphics rendered with a light pen, some of which were
          representations of handwriting [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>, 131–132]. Mapping
          the gameworld on paper was still often necessary even when the gameworld was visually
          rendered. For example, in <cite class="title italic">Wizardry</cite> (1981), the dungeons were
          designed so as to be mappable on graph paper and the manual emphasized the importance of
          mapping [<a class="ref" href="#barton2008">Barton 2008</a>, 71]. Players of such games also used paper in
          order to keep track of other relevant information not tracked automatically by the game.
          Players of games like <cite class="title italic">Wizardry</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Ultima</cite> (1980) were heavily reliant on paper "notes,
              records and ledgers of their individual game experiences" [<a class="ref" href="#myers2003">Myers 2003</a>, 17]. In this respect these games mimicked the
          non-electronic genre from which they were descended: the "paper-and-pencil" RPG [<a class="ref" href="#myers2003">Myers 2003</a>, 16], whose very name comes
          from the fact that it employs handwriting as a system of record-keeping.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Over the course of video game history, the embodied and scriptural modes of interaction
          characteristic of early video gaming were shunted aside by other modes of interaction
          which claimed to offer greater transparency or immersivity.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e331">[8]</a><blockquote><p>After <cite class="title italic">ADVENT</cite> [i.e. <cite class="title italic">Adventure</cite>], the adventure genre moved through several
              superficially distinct forms: the original text adventures; graphic adventures (e.g.,
                <cite class="title italic">Myst</cite>); and third-person graphic adventures (e.g.,
                <cite class="title italic">King's Quest</cite>). The differences among these were the
              result of differences among game signifiers; each employed the same basic
              signification process. [<a class="ref" href="#myers2003">Myers 2003</a>, 15]</p></blockquote> These latter genres were functionally
          identical to the text adventure in terms of gameplay, but their more transparent graphical
          interfaces decreased the player's ability to inscribe himself or herself into the
          gameworld. The increasing visual richness of the gameworld deprives the player of the need
          or desire to imagine it. A game like <cite class="title italic">Myst</cite>, for example,
          offers the player little if any opportunity to inscribe anything into the gameworld
          because that world is already prerendered in immense detail. (This is ironic, since the
          premise of <cite class="title italic">Myst</cite> is that one can transport oneself into other
          worlds by <em class="emph">writing</em> about them, and the infradiegetic texts in the game are
          handwritten.) Figuratively, as graphics become more transparent, the condition of
          possibility of inscription on the player's part — the existence of a blank space on which
          to write — is lost. An analogous development was the introduction of automapping in the
          late 1980s, which eliminated the need to graphically depict the gameworld on paper.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">Mainstream accounts of video game history tend to ignore the loss of the inscriptional
          and material aspects of video gaming, or to treat this loss as the natural consequence of
          the medium's evolution toward greater transparency. For example, Julian Dibbell
          dismissively contrasts <cite class="title italic">Adventure</cite>'s "laconic text descriptions navigated by means of simple two-word commands" with
            <cite class="title italic">Myst</cite>'s point-and-click interface and "complex graphical environments of an almost liquid radiance" [<a class="ref" href="#dibbell2001">Dibbell 2001</a>]. Dibbell characterizes <cite class="title italic">Adventure</cite>, with its sparse textual descriptions and its unnatural interface, as
          the starting point of a teleological progression that culminates in the radiant visuality
          and naturalistic interface of <cite class="title italic">Myst</cite> (and now in stereoscopic
          3D graphics and controllerless interfaces like Microsoft's Kinect). In presenting
          transparency as the teleological goal of video gaming, such accounts seek to draw
          attention away from the possibilities of embodied inscription that are foreclosed by
          transparency, following what Terry Harpold calls the discourse of the upgrade path:
              <blockquote><p>Because technical innovation in popular computing is driven
              more by the allure of expanding markets than by something so quaint as a sense of
              responsibility to historical continuity, commercial discourses of the upgrade path
              will inevitably promise consumers new and more satisfying interactions, and encourage
              them to see the older ones as outmoded or no longer relevant. [<a class="ref" href="#harpold2009">Harpold 2009</a>, 3]</p></blockquote> Yet the disappearance of handwriting also
          inspires nostalgia for and fantasies of handwriting. Within the video game industry, this
          began to occur as early as 1983 when Infocom, the preeminent developer of text adventure
          games, released ads that claimed: <blockquote><p>We draw our graphics from the
            limitless imagery of your imagination — a technology so powerful, it makes any picture
            that's ever come out of a screen look like graffiti by comparison […] And you're immersed
            in rich environments alive with personalities as real as any you'll meet in the flesh —
            yet all the more vivid because they're perceived directly by your mind's eye, not
            through your external senses.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e393">[9]</a></p></blockquote>
          This claim follows the logic of transparency <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bolter2003">#bolter2003</a></span> in
          that it characterizes text as <em class="emph">more</em> visually rich and immersive than graphics,
          since the power of imaginative visualization is not subject to the limits of current
          graphical technology. Accordingly, other ads from this campaign criticize the quality of
          contemporaneous computer graphics.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Yet the ad also implies that text has advantages over graphics regardless of graphics'
          present state of technological evolution: it begins by claiming "there's never been a computer made by man that could handle the images we produce. And
            there never will be." Whatever their quality, graphics are limited by technological constraints, whereas mental
          images are limited only by the player's imaginative capacity and existing repertory of
          visual experience. (Perhaps deliberately, the Infocom ad fails to acknowledge that these
          are hardly insignificant limits, or that players might differ in their ability or
          inclination to visualize.) Moreover, imaginative visualization of the gameworld is an
          embodied process situated in the player's brain: the ad campaign describes the brain as
            "the world's most powerful graphics technology."
          Visualization varies according to the preferences of each individual player, and is thus
          as personal as handwriting, whereas graphics look the same to everyone. In stressing the
          value of text over graphics, Infocom nostalgically advocated the personalized aspects of
          older technology against the allegedly superior transparency of newer technology.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">This sort of nostalgia was more restorative than reflective, as it merely
          argued that the old technology was better than the new one. Such restorative nostalgia is
          not uncommon in the video game industry: "As game technology has
              improved and as daily life becomes more saturated with media technology, [...] early
              video games have also become objects of nostalgia in that their low-resolution
              aesthetics have come to be perceived as a retrospective ideal" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#whalen2008">#whalen2008</a></span>. Video game nostalgia becomes reflective rather than restorative when game creators
          acknowledge that earlier video games are retroactively altered in the process of
          remembering them. Reflective nostalgia can even be aided by the use of the same new gaming
          technologies that made the old ones obsolete; the superior affordances of new video gaming
          technologies can be used to open up ways of rethinking and reimagining older gaming genres
          and technologies. For example, the Nintendo DS <cite class="title italic">Retro Game Challenge</cite> (Namco
          Bandai Games, 2007/2009) offers a collection of eight video games that parody or pay homage
          various NES games; it takes advantage of the superior storage of DS cartridges. What's
          essential, however, is that the nostalgic game not merely repeat the object of nostalgia;
          it must also acknowledge the fact that the object of nostalgia is unrecoverable in its
          originary form. Similar claims can be made about video games that incorporate nostalgia
          for and fantasies of handwriting. In order to be productive, such games have to take into
          account the profound gap between handwriting and the digital technologies used to
          remediate it, rather than seeking to fully restore handwriting to its original state.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">I will demonstrate this by means of case studies of two games for the Nintendo DS
          handheld system — a system which has unusual material features that, I will argue, make it
          particularly well adapted to the presentation of fantasies of handwriting. Thus, by
          examining DS games that take advantage of these features, we can learn much about how
          fantasies of handwriting are transformed by digital technology.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">The DS is unique in that it features two screens. The top screen is a conventional LCD
          screen, but the bottom screen is overlaid with a resistive touchscreen which accepts input
          from a stylus or other pointing device. A resistive touchscreen consists of two sheets of
          electrically resistive material with a gap between them. When the stylus makes contact
          with the surface of the screen, the two sheets are compressed together, creating an
          electrical impulse, and the X and Y coordinates of the location of the impulse are
          registered [<a class="ref" href="#wikipedia2010a">Wikipedia 2010a</a>].</div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/resources/images/figure01.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/resources/images/figure01.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>The Nintendo DS.

          use the stylus only for optional minigames. In some DS games — e.g. <cite class="title italic">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</cite> (2009) or <cite class="title italic">Dragon Quest
            IX</cite> (2010) — the stylus is used merely as a pointing device, and the player uses
          it only to perform nondiegetic operator acts or move acts <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#galloway2006">#galloway2006</a></span>. In other games, however, using the stylus represents an expressive act,
          i.e. an action that "exert[s] an expressive desire outward from
              the player character to objects in the world that are deemed actionable" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#galloway2006">#galloway2006</a></span>. In DS games, the action expressed by using
          the stylus is often the act of using a tool, and the stylus often <em class="emph">represents</em>
          this tool, in the same sense in which a theatrical prop sword "represents" a real
          sword. This is a crucial difference between the DS stylus and other video game control
          mechanisms. In general, players always perform expressive acts by means of some form of
          material engagement with the game's control mechanism: "while
              there is an imaginative form of the expressive act within the diegesis of the game,
              there is also a physical form of the same act" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#galloway2006">#galloway2006</a></span>. However, with traditional control
          mechanisms the "physical form" and the "imaginative form" usually have little in
          common. The player pushes a button to make the avatar jump, fire a gun, swing a sword, or
          do various other acts that are dissimilar to the act of pushing a button. By contrast,
          with the DS stylus, the "physical form" of an expressive act often resembles its
            "imaginative form," because the player uses the stylus — an elongated, hand-held
          tool — to simulate an act that is performed using just such a tool. For example, in <cite class="title italic">Trauma Center: Under the Knife</cite> (2005), the player uses the stylus
          as a scalpel, simulating the act of making an incision by "cutting" along a line
          drawn on a patient's body. In <cite class="title italic">Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown
            Wars</cite> (2009), the player hotwires a car by using the stylus to unscrew the
          ignition switch. The player draws a circle on the screen, simulating the act of turning a
          screwdriver.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Other contemporary gaming systems — the Nintendo Wii, the Sony Move, the Microsoft Kinect
          — make similar use of analog control mechanisms in order to erase the gap between the
          physical and the imaginative form of the expressive act. For example, in <cite class="title italic">Kinect Sports</cite> (2010), the player plays table tennis using his or
          her hand as a paddle, or throws a javelin by making the appropriate arm motion. However,
          the DS differs from these three platforms in that it requires physical contact with a
          two-dimensional control surface. Using the Wii, Kinect or Move entails making gestures in
          the air, whether with a control device or without. Using the DS entails making
          inscriptions on a surface. This makes the DS uniquely appropriate for the simulation of
          physical acts that involve engagement between a hand-held tool and a flat surface — and
          the principal example of such an act is <em class="emph">writing</em>. The DS is thus particularly
          well suited to the simulation of handwriting and the promulgation of fantasies of
          handwriting, and the two games I will analyze in depth both employ the DS for this
          purpose. Again, these games can be differentiated from games on other platforms that
          employ interfaces that mimic handwriting. Perhaps the most notable example of such a game
          is <cite class="title italic">Ōkami</cite> (Clover Studio, 2006), a PlayStation 2 game, later
          ported to the Wii, in which the player can transform the three-dimensionally rendered
          gameworld in various ways by writing on it with a "Celestial
            Brush."<cite class="title italic">Ōkami</cite>, however, is controlled with an analog thumbstick (or
          later the Wiimote) rather than a true handwriting interface, and thus the player of Ōkami
          simulates handwriting by performing an act which only loosely resembles the actual act of
          handwriting. The difference between the Celestial Brush and a real ink brush is obvious —
          much more obvious than the difference between the DS stylus and an actual pen or
          pencil.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Using the DS stylus <em class="emph">feels</em> like handwriting. This perception is reinforced by
          the material qualities of the system itself, which is about the size and shape of a small
          paperback volume. Some games (e.g. <cite class="title italic">Hotel Dusk: Room 215</cite>
          [2007]) even ask the player to hold the DS sideways, so that the player feels he or she is
          holding a small datebook or planner in one hand, and writing in it with the other. It's
          because of the close perceptual similarity between DS writing and handwriting that the DS
          represents such a crucial test case for fantasies of handwriting. Does the DS merely
          create a dishonest simulacrum of handwriting, or can the DS open up a space for critical
          reflection on what handwriting means? My two case studies will address this question.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head"><cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite></h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">One of the most heavily hyped DS games of 2009, <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> revolves around a premise which is brilliant in its simplicity.
          When the player writes the name of any object, within certain limits, that object is
          created. In other words, if the player writes anything from "scissors" to "sewing
            machine" to "Cthulhu" (using either an onscreen keypad or a handwriting
          interface), that object appears in the gameworld. The player can then move it around with
          the stylus, and it can interact with other objects and with the player character. This
          simple premise creates the possibility of an arbitrarily large number of object
          interactions and puzzle solutions. <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>'s lexicon
          includes tens of thousands of words, so any common object the player can think of is quite
          likely to be included, creating the impression that the player's freedom of action is
          limited less by the game's lexicon than by his or her imagination and vocabulary.</div><div id="figure02" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/resources/images/figure02.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/resources/images/figure02.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>Cover of <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>.</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24"><cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> presents this gaming mechanic as a remediation
          of handwriting. To "scribble" is to "write in an irregular,
              slovenly, or illegible hand through haste or carelessness; also, to produce (marks, a
              drawing, etc.) or portray (an object) by rapid and irregular strokes like those of
              hurried writing" [<a class="ref" href="#oed1989">OED 1989</a>]. Although "scribbling" may pertain to content as
          well as penmanship, the word has strong associations with handwriting. A
            scribble<em class="emph">naut</em>, then, is one who writes quickly and playfully, by hand, as a
          means of exploration — or, by analogy with "astronaut," one who explores the realm of
          scribbles. On the game's cover, we see the avatar, Maxwell, writing with a pencil. The
          logo looks handwritten (the two B's look significantly different) and the slogan is set in
          the Comic Sans font, which mimics the stereotypical handwriting of comic book letterers.
          In the game, the visual motif of wide-ruled notebook paper, which appears on the
          handwriting interface screen, alludes to elementary school handwriting exercises. <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> thus connects handwriting with childhood, and thus
          promises to return the player to an idyllic former state when handwriting represented a
          new way of expressing oneself both visually and linguistically. The DS itself is often
          denigrated as a system for children, perhaps due to this very association of handwriting
          with childhood as well as to its large library of educational software. <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> seems to accept this characterization and to turn it
          into something positive, as indicated by one artistic response to the game [<a class="ref" href="#munroe2009">Munroe 2009</a>]: <div id="figure03" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/resources/images/figure03.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/resources/images/figure03.png" alt=""/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 3. </div><cite class="title">Scribblenauts</cite>,

          of "DS" with "kids," the female stick figure accuses him of pretentiousness. The
          point is that <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> is a "kid's
            game" in a positive sense. It partakes of the optimism of childhood and reminds
          the player of the novelty and empowerment involved in first learning to write. (This is,
          of course, restorative nostalgia, as it ignores that the study of handwriting is usually
          stigmatized in American culture as tedious busywork, and may only be remembered fondly in
          hindsight).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26"><cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> offers the player something more than
          handwriting itself provides, since it turns handwriting into a means of generating magical
          effects. However, the suggestion is that the differences between actual handwriting and
          the <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> interface are differences of degree rather
          than kind. If <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> gives the player the magical
          power to summon objects into existence (or the same level of existence enjoyed by the
          other preexisting objects in the gameworld), then this is precisely what handwriting does,
          according to fantasies of handwriting. In such fantasies, handwriting means writing
          oneself <em class="emph">into the world</em>. The handwritten word or the hand-drawn line is a
          material object as well as a sign — as is whimsically demonstrated in the silent cartoon
            "Comicalamities" (1928), where Otto Messmer draws Felix the
          Cat in pen, and Felix then starts to behave independently and interact with his creator.
          By writing with pen and paper, one creates permanent material traces which are as real as
          the pen and paper. Thus, in <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>, when the player writes "shovel," a simulated shovel
          comes into existence and, within the diegetic world, has at least as much solidity and
          permanence as the written word "shovel" would in the real world. The game suggests
          that this simulated object does not merely replace, but is instead <em class="emph">identical</em>
          to, its handwritten name. (By toggling an onscreen icon, the player can tap any object to
          see its name. When this is done with a player-created object, the game displays the name
          that was used to create that object, even if it has other possible names.) In <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>, to write by hand is literally to create objects,
          and this is presented not as a drastic alteration of the meaning of handwriting but as an unleashing of
          a magical potential that was always already present in handwriting. Of course there is a
          difficulty here, in that the words the player actually writes in <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> are far less permanent than actual handwriting. When the player
          writes “shovel,” each letter of the word vanishes from the screen once written (the game's
          handwriting interface allows the player to write only one letter at a time), so the
          handwritten word never even exists as a complete entity. However, the creators of <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> seem to want the player to ignore this difference
          between the game's handwriting and originary handwriting.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27"><cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> further enacts the fantasy of handwriting by
          promising that, through using handwriting to create objects, the player can practice the
          values of personality and creativity that handwriting represents, by traversing the game
          however s/he chooses. The game's slogan, "Write Anything. Solve
            Everything," testifies to this promise of unlimited interactional freedom. On the
          game's title screen, the player can literally fulfill the first half of this slogan by
          writing objects without the risk of dying. Of course, the title screen is not actually a
          game in the strict sense, because games employ "rules and
              constraints in order to define and bound the play experience" [<a class="ref" href="#tanenbaum2009">Tanenbaum &amp; Tanenbaum 2009</a>, 3]. A successful gameplay experience involves
          a delicate balance between player agency and authorial control, in which the player
          expresses agency within the contours of an authorial framework.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e653">[10]</a> This is analogous to how
          handwriting, as fantasized, involves personal improvisation on predefined letterforms.
          However, the gamic (i.e. goal-oriented) portion of <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> provides an unusually loose authorial framework, and
          thus claims to offer the player broad opportunities to express the same sort of creative
          agency that handwriting represents. In each of <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>’s 220 levels, the player's goal is to obtain a McGuffin object
          called a "Starite," either by traversing a series of obstacles to reach the Starite,
          or by fulfilling a predefined condition in order to make the Starite appear. The player
          can use any object or combination of objects in order to solve each level. Because of the
          vastness of the game's lexicon, each level (supposedly) has many possible solutions none
          of which is uniquely correct. Therefore, the achievement of solving a level testifies to
          the player's ability to think creatively, as opposed to merely reconstructing the solution
          the developer had in mind. The game even rewards the player for solving each puzzle three
          times without reusing any words. In playing <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>,
          then, the player not only writes objects into existence, but does so in a creative,
          idiosyncratic way, so that the objects the player writes are also testaments to the
          player's faculty for creative thinking and improvisation.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">In short, <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> enacts the fantasy of handwriting in
          a highly literal way. The game's massive critical and commercial success, despite several
          widely acknowledged flaws, suggests that this strategy of cultivating nostalgia for
          handwriting appeals to DS consumers.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e674">[11]</a> However, the trouble
          with the fantasy of handwriting is that it is a fantasy — an account of what we
            <em class="emph">want</em> handwriting to be, not of what handwriting actually is. The fantasy of
          handwriting expresses a <em class="emph">desire</em> to engage in a certain type of material
          interaction, yet this desire is predicated on a lack: we only want handwriting because we
          don't and can't have it. When games or other texts try to satisfy the desire for the
          fantasized version of handwriting, all they can accomplish is to show the unsatisfiability
          of that desire.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">This, at least, is what happens in <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>. This game
          can only fulfill its promise to satisfy the desire for handwriting if it actually enables
          the player to use handwriting as an interface. However, in actual game play, the player is
          discouraged from using the handwriting interface because of its inefficiency. <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> offers two different interfaces: a handwriting
          interface in which the player writes one letter at a time, and an onscreen keypad. Thus:
              <blockquote><p>The original design of <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> called for writing letters, with the stylus to serve as the
              main method of word input — we loved the visceral feeling of writing and watching an
              object appear. [<a class="ref" href="#tringali2009">Tringali 2009</a>]</p></blockquote> Accordingly, the game's developers, 5th Cell, used the keyboard interface only
          as "backup" while designing custom handwriting recognition software. However:
              <blockquote><p>Eventually we realized that no handwriting recognition
              software could operate faster than a keyboard. We still spent time refining the letter
              recognition, but it was clear keyboard input would be the primary input method for
                <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>. [<a class="ref" href="#tringali2009">Tringali 2009</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">Greater speed is the primary affordance of the keyboard interface in <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> over the handwriting interface, and indeed, of typing over
          handwriting more generally. Despite the best efforts of pedagogues like Austin Norman
          Palmer, handwriting can't compete with the mechanical efficiency of typing. Indeed, this
          is one major <em class="emph">reason</em> for the contemporary privileging of handwriting. For Arts
          and Crafts calligraphy revivalists, handwriting was valuable because it represented
          conscious, thoughtful craftsmanship, in contrast to the soulless efficiency of the machine
            [<a class="ref" href="#thornton1996">Thornton 1996</a>, 179–181]. This valuation of handwriting as a sign of
          individual creative labor is closely allied to <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>’s ideological project. Yet as a fast-paced action game, <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> cannot afford the loss of gameplay speed that
          handwriting entails, and it gives the player no incentive to use the handwriting interface
          rather than the keyboard.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Furthermore, even if the player uses the handwriting interface, this doesn't entail a
          complete revival of handwriting, because handwriting recognition technology involves
          stripping out the unique and personal aspects of the player's handwriting. According to
          two experts in the field, handwriting recognition is defined as "the task of transforming a language represented in its spatial form of signifying
              marks into its symbolic representation" [<a class="ref" href="#plamondon2000">Plamondon &amp; Srihari 2000</a>, 64]. It operates by recording the temporal and
          spatial parameters of handwritten traces, preprocessing them to eliminate noise, and then
          comparing them to a set of predefined letterforms stored in memory. Its purpose is to
          extract the semantic value of a handwritten message, precisely by abstracting out the
          excessive and idiosyncratic qualities that make handwriting an object of nostalgia:
              "[H]andwriting recognition and interpretation are processes
              whose objectives are to filter out the variations so as to determine the
              message" [<a class="ref" href="#plamondon2000">Plamondon &amp; Srihari 2000</a>, 64]. <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>, then, can only preserve the idiosyncrasy of the player's
          handwriting in a figurative sense, if at all, and not in a literal sense.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">Finally, writing on the DS touchscreen is an extreme abstraction of writing on paper,
          because the DS's touchscreen records only the two-dimensional shape of a stroke and the
          order and direction in which strokes were made. It ignores, for example, the pressure with
          which the stroke is made, a property which other touchscreen technologies try to preserve.
          (Wacom graphics tablets, for example, come with a pressure-sensitive stylus).<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e750">[12]</a> Moreover,
          the touchscreen itself, unlike paper, is a purely two-dimensional surface; it has only one
          side and no thickness. Nor does the touchscreen perserve the
          visible traces of what's written on it. When a line is drawn on a touchscreen, it's
          recorded as stroke data which may be permanently stored in memory, yet the line itself
          soon disappears. The DS may <em class="emph">feel</em> more like paper than other video game
          technologies, yet it is irreducibly <em class="emph">unlike</em> paper in terms of how it responds
          to input. In general, the DS does a much more effective job of remediating handwriting
          than the PS2 or the Wii did (in the case of <cite class="title italic">Ōkami</cite>). Even so,
          the DS's version of handwriting is quite far from the real thing.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">It would obviously be premature to conclude from this that touchscreen technology is
          incapable of replicating the "personal" or "embodied" properties of handwriting

          present in handwriting to begin with. We can, however, conclude that the DS's handwriting
          recognition technology is <em class="emph">not intended</em> to preserve the player's subjective
          traces. The DS's handwriting interface is a component, not of a dedicated artistic tool
          like a Wacom tablet, but of a gaming interface. It therefore has to enable
            <em class="emph">both</em> player agency, which includes creativity, and <em class="emph">efficient</em>
          interaction — which often operate at cross purposes, as demonstrated when 5th Cell ceased
          development on the <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> handwriting interface. When
          5th Cell used the DS to present an uncritical version of the fantasy of handwriting, they
          failed to do so with complete success, because they ignored the gap between DS handwriting

          handwriting in a literal sense, nor does it fully succeed in doing so in a figurative
          sense by enabling players to exercise the creative agency that handwriting represents. The
          game often provides insufficient opportunities to exercise creative agency. Many of its
          levels ask the player to repeatedly perform the same tasks, like killing enemies, flying,
          swimming or digging through dirt, and only a few words in the lexicon are capable of
          accomplishing these tasks efficiently. The need to repeatedly perform these tasks forces
          the player to overrely on certain words, which limits the player's ability to exercise
          genuine creativity.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e787">[13]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">This isn't to say that <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> can't trigger

          handwriting it offers. Indeed, <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> is likely to
          produce this effect unintentionally, by forcing the player to observe the incomplete
          success of its remediation of handwriting. However, it appears that producing critical
          reflection on handwriting was not 5th Cell's primary intent in creating this game;
          instead, they sought merely to use the DS interface to satisfy the desire for handwriting.
          By contrast, <cite class="title italic">The World Ends with You</cite> makes a more sincere
          effort to encourage critical reflection on handwriting, because it makes no claim to fully
          satisfy the desire for handwriting. In examining this game, therefore, we can get a better
          idea of what a critical, digital version of the fantasy of handwriting might look like.

          (TWEWY) was released in Japan in 2007 under the title <cite class="title italic"><span class="foreign i">Subarashiki kono sekai</span></cite> ("It's a
            Wonderful World"), and was released in America and Europe the following
              year.<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e833">[14]</a> Although it
          resembles a traditional SquareEnix role-playing game (RPG) in many ways,<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e844">[15]</a><cite class="title italic">The World Ends with You</cite> is notable for its highly innovative
          combat system, which requires players to control both the DS's screens at the same time.
          In combat, the player's avatar, Neku, appears on the touch screen. Over the course of the
          game, Neku collects objects called “pins”, most of which give Neku magical abilities —
          called "psychs" — when equipped in combat. Each psych is triggered by performing a
          specified action with the stylus (except for some which are triggered by blowing into the
          DS's microphone). These actions include touching an enemy, slashing an enemy (i.e. drawing
          a line across it), drawing a circle on the screen, picking up and dragging onscreen
          objects, and rubbing the screen repeatedly. Neku’s partner appears on the top screen, and
          the player uses either the D-pad or the action buttons to choose the direction in which
          the partner attacks. Since the buttons on the left-hand side of the DS have the same
          functions as the buttons on the right-hand side, the player uses the non-dominant hand to
          push buttons while using the dominant hand to control the touch screen. (Obviously,
          controlling two screens at once takes some getting used to, but in practice the bottom
          screen usually requires most of the player's attention.)<div id="figure04" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/resources/images/figure04.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000098/resources/images/figure04.jpg" alt=""/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div>Screenshots from "The World Ends with You".

To control
          Neku, the player draws straight lines, circles and dots, or drags heavy objects over
          enemies, as if using a pencil eraser. The game seems to ask the player to press buttons
          and write or draw by hand at the same time, thus engaging simultaneously in manual
          and digital means of writing. In short, then, playing <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite><em class="emph">feels like</em> handwriting. Yet, for all the reasons cited above, it's not
          handwriting; there is a profound gap between <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite>
          handwriting and originary handwriting. <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> only detects
          whether the player has correctly executed the stylus action corresponding to the pins Neku
          is wearing, and ignores the idiosyncratic aspects of the player's handwriting. This
          becomes obvious, for example, when Neku wears two pins that require similar stylus
          actions, such as "touch" and "tap rapidly." The game has trouble distinguishing
          between these actions because both are represented by the same patterns of stroke
          data.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">Where <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> crucially differs from <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> is that it acknowledges this gap between DS writing and originary
          handwriting. It doesn't present the touchscreen as an uncritical restoration of
          handwriting. It makes few explicit references to handwriting, except that it uses the
          euphemism "erased" for "killed." Its touchscreen commands are not called
          penstrokes but "stylus actions." The similarity between handwriting and playing
            <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> is not foregrounded. <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite>, then, is not constrained by the ideological project of producing a
          replica of fantasized handwriting. Its success or failure as a game is not measured by the
          similarity or dissimilarity of its writing system to the fantasized version of
          handwriting. Instead of trying to literally recreate handwriting, SquareEnix was able to
          simply seek to create a system that offers the characteristic pleasure of handwriting: the
          expression of creative agency through embodied interaction. Combat in <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> is not handwriting, but it's fun for the same reasons that handwriting is
          fun. It engages the hand (both hands, in fact) and the rest of the body, whereas combat in
          other SquareEnix titles is often a boring process of repetitive button-mashing. It allows
          one to immediately view the results of one's actions, although these results come in the
          form of damage to enemies rather than permanent inscriptions. Moreover, <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> offers the player genuine freedom of play style, since many
          different pins are available and the player can therefore choose the pins that suit
          his/her personal play style. Unlike <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite>, <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> doesn't claim that this freedom is unlimited or that the
          player can "draw anything." Rather than trying to uncritically satisfy the desire for
          handwriting — a project which is impossible because this desire is based on a constitutive
          lack — <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> uses digital processes to evoke the memory of
          handwriting. It is therefore able to open up a space for critical reflection on what
          handwriting meant and on how our memory of handwriting might inform our engagement with
          the post-digital world. This is in keeping with Boym's definition of reflective as opposed
          to restorative nostalgia: <blockquote><p>Restorative nostalgia puts emphasis on
                <em class="emph">nostos</em> and proposes to rebuild the lost home and patch up the memory
              gaps. Reflective nostalgia dwells in <em class="emph">algia</em>, in longing and loss, the
              imperfect process of remembrance [<a class="ref" href="#boym2002">Boym 2002</a>, 41]</p></blockquote>. Rather than simply trying to revive
          handwriting (and inevitably failing), <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> invites the
          player to notice the gaps between its interface and handwriting, and to reflect on what
          these gaps might mean.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39"><cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> further encourages such reflection by means of its
          story, which, as with most SquareEnix games, is heavily foregrounded. The <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> player uses the handwriting interface not only for its own
          sake, but also as means of progressing through a story in which the values associated with
          handwriting — creativity and individuality — play crucial roles. (By contrast, <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> effectively has no story; the game never explains
          who Maxwell is, why he is able to write objects into existence, or what his motivation is
          for collecting Starites.)<a class="noteRef" href="#d37068e949">[16]</a><cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite>’s story argues that creativity and idiosyncrasy are of
          vital importance, but are not simply there for the taking; these values must be obtained
          and defended through active effort. Moreover, these values are not absolute. Taken to an
          extreme, the desire to assert and express the embodied self leads merely to narcissism, to
          a neglect of the socially situated nature of the self. In order to make productive use of
          the qualities that handwriting stands for, the writer must realize that handwriting is
          useless in a vacuum; it only works because of a constitutive gap between the self and the
          other. Handwriting requires a reader.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">The game's setting — Shibuya, the fashion capital of Japan — is portrayed as a space
          where many subcultures interact, each characterized by particular fashion and lifestyle
          choices. Shibuya is a space where Neku and his allies are free to define their own styles,
          to express their personalities visibly. Accordingly, creativity is the guiding principle
          of the game's protagonists. Neku's role model is a graphic designer named CAT, precisely
          because of CAT's philosophy of exuberant individuality and freedom (CAT's motto is "Do what you want, how you want, when you want it"). Neku's first
          partner, Shiki, is an aspiring fashion designer.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Conversely, the goal of the game's villains is to eliminate creativity and individuality,
          which they see as security risks. Mr. Kitaniji, one of the game’s principal villains,
          calls Shibuya "a cacophony of countless selfish wants" and
          claims, "As that noise swells, it turns into crime, warfare... All the
            world’s ills can be traced to individuality!" For example, in one episode the
          villains open a new noodle restaurant and pay a popular blogger, the Prince, to recommend
          it to his readers. The Prince's fans obediently flock to Shadow Ramen, not because they
          like the food but because their arbiter of taste tells them to. As collateral damage,
          Shadow Ramen threatens the existing local ramen restaurant, whose owner, Ken Doi, is
          guided by his own honest creative compulsions. His motto is "I just
            serve up the kind of ramen I’d want to eat." Faced with the threat of bankruptcy,
          however, Ken Doi abandons this philosophy and starts looking for the "next big thing" in ramen. Thanks to Neku and his partner's intervention,
          however, the Prince becomes ashamed of lying to his readers and of recommending food he
          dislikes. He retracts his positive review of Shadow Ramen, saving Ken Doi's restaurant. A
          small battle in the war for creativity has been won. Thus, at the same time that the game
          stresses the value of creativity and individuality, it stresses that these values are
          constantly threatened by conformity. Creativity exists in a constant dialectic with
          conformism — indeed, perhaps it can't exist otherwise, since these concepts are defined by
          their mutual opposition — and the preservation of creativity is therefore never an
          uncomplicated task. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">This is fortunate, because handwriting is a means of intersubjective communication as
          well as creative expression. Rather than uncritically praising creativity as <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> does, <cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> suggests
          that when individuality is taken too far, it leads to solipsism. Creativity and
          individuality function only within a larger value hierarchy which includes respect for
          others. Neku's problem is that he focuses exclusively on self-expression, and therefore
          has little concern for other people; hence the game's pessimistic title. Over the course
          of the game he learns to collaborate productively with his partners — something which the
          player is forced to also learn by mastering the game's battle system, which requires
          simultaneous control of Neku and his partner — and in the ending the title is replaced by
          the phrase "The World Begins with You."<cite class="title italic">TWEWY</cite> presents creativity not as an absolute value, but as a
          function of the democratic interaction of multiple conflicting subjectivities. The game
          demonstrates this perfectly with its mechanic of branding. The game includes 13 brands of
          clothing and pins, and each area in the game has a list of popular and unpopular brands.
          Pins receive a power boost if they belong to a most popular brand, and a penalty if they
          belong to an unpopular one. Thus, the player has an incentive to be a slave to fashion.
          However, if the player fights several battles in an area while wearing pins and clothing
          of a certain brand, then that brand will become more popular and its corresponding pins
          will become more powerful. Thus the player also has an incentive to be a trendsetter and
          is not discouraged from dressing the characters according to his or her wishes; however,
          the player is also encouraged to work at sharing his or her stylistic preferences with
          others. Much like handwriting, fashion is of little use unless someone else can understand
          it.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">Both these modes of expressing creativity are based on a constitutive gap between the
          creative self and another self toward whom that creativity is expressed. The DS's
          remediation of handwriting is necessarily incomplete, failing to permit the player to
          perfectly express his or her self (because, for example, the DS's handwriting interface
          works by stripping out the idiosyncratic qualities of the player's handwriting). But this
          is only a literal example of the way in which handwriting itself is also necessarily
          incomplete. As Derrida remarks, handwriting works not because of the presence but because
          of the constitutive <em class="emph">absence</em> of the self; handwriting serves little purpose
          when the writer is actually present. Signatures, for example, only work because they're
          iterable: <blockquote><p>The condition of possibility for these effects [of
              signature] is simultaneously, once again, the condition of their impossibility, of the
              impossibility of their rigorous purity. In order to function, that is, in order to be
              legible, a signature must have a repeatable, iterable, imitable form; it must be able
              to detach itself from the present and singular intention of its production. [<a class="ref" href="#derrida1982">Derrida 1982</a>, 328]</p></blockquote> If DS handwriting "detaches itself" from the embodied self that produces it, then it merely
          functions in the same way that paper handwriting always has.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">In encouraging the player to confront the incompleteness of handwriting, then, <cite class="title italic">The World Ends with You</cite> opens up a space for critical reflection
          on handwriting and on the concept of the self that handwriting presupposes. It invites the
          player to ask whether handwriting ever really worked the way it was supposed to, or
          whether the embodied self of handwriting ever existed to begin with. <cite class="title italic">The World Ends with You</cite> therefore goes beyond <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> by using the unique properties of the DS to present a reflective,
          critical version of the fantasy of handwriting.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Discussion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">Nostalgia for older media is a common theme in contemporary critical and popular
          discourses, and the insights gained by observing the DS's remediation of handwriting can
          prompt more general reflections on the motivations behind such nostalgia. In what Bill Brown calls the "dematerialization hypothesis" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#brown2010">#brown2010</a></span>, digital media are often seen as severing the
          physical connections that formerly existed between human bodies and technological tools.
          As an example of this hypothesis, Brown quotes Colin Renfrew: "Because 'the electronic impulse is replacing whatever remained of
                the material element in the images to which we became accustomed,' the 'engagement with the material world where the material object was the
                repository of meaning is being threatened'" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#brown2010">#brown2010</a></span>. What the dematerialization hypothesis often
          assumes, however, is that there <em class="emph">was</em> a previously existing condition of "engagement with the material world," and that when this condition
          existed, its beneficial effects were understood and cherished. As seen in the above
          discussion of Birkerts, these assumptions are questionable. Even if a given medium (e.g.,
          photography or handwriting) ever was fully "material," it may not have been
          understood as such until it was challenged by a less "material" medium. Therefore,
          nostalgic appeals to the superior materiality of older media may be unconsciously based on
          a revisionary understanding of these media. Nostalgia, in such cases, merely expresses a
          desire to return to a lost home, forgetting that this home never existed to begin with.
            <cite class="title italic">Scribblenauts</cite> is a clear example of this pattern.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">Nostalgia for media such as handwriting becomes productive and generative, however, when
          it serves as an occasion for critical reflection on the meaning of the old media. Instead
          of simply claiming to restore us to a lost condition of full materiality, this mode of
          nostalgia asks us to consider: Did we care about this condition of materiality when we had
          it? If so, why — what sort of values did we attach to it? Now that we've lost this
          condition of materiality, why do we desire it — what sort of lack does this desire respond
          to? And would we truly benefit if this desire were satisfied? <cite class="title italic">The
            World Ends with You</cite> effectively mobilizes nostalgia to prompt this sort of
          questioning. At its best, then, the fantasy of handwriting doesn't simply claim to
          uncritically restore to us the lost power of handwriting; instead, it makes us ask
          ourselves <em class="emph">why</em> we want to write ourselves into the world.</div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d37068e121"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>See <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#brown2010">#brown2010</a></span> for a helpful survey of

            uniquely privileged vehicle for the expression of subjectivity — as are lyric poetry,
            diary writing or blogging — but some degree of self-expression (or something similar) is

            level of success despite being hampered by control probems, such as poor camera control
