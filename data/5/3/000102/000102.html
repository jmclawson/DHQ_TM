          research, the humanities profession has been slow to accept digital scholarship as a valid
          form of intellectual endeavor. Questions about labor, peer-review, and co-authorship often
          arise in academic departments’ attempts to evaluate digital research in the tenure and
          promotion process. In this essay, we argue that these tensions stem from a general
          misunderstanding of the kinds of "work" that goes into producing
          scholarship in multimedia form. Multimedia work, we suggest, places scholars in an
          extended network that combines minds, bodies, machines, and institutional practices, and
          lays bare the fiction that scholars are disembodied intellectuals who labor only with the
          mind. We argue that while traditional ideas of what "counts" as
          scholarship continue to privilege content over form, intellectual labor over physical
          labor, and print over digital media, new media’s functional (and in some cases even
          biological) difference from old media contributes to a double erasure, for scholars
          working in multimedia, of both their intellectual contributions and their material
          labor.</p></div><div class="div div0"><div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p class="ptext">I construct, and I am constructed, in a mutually recursive process

          professors and students at academic institutions in the mid-1990s, a profound
          transformation was well under way. Digital preservation, spearheaded by the Text Encoding
          Initiative and other similar efforts to apply computing power to literary analysis and
          preservation, had become a well established, if somewhat marginalized, field of study. For
          literary critics interested in computing, text had morphed into hypertext. Still others
          recognized that multimedia, as a practice, was a promising new frontier; as a result,
          media studies quickly became new media studies. In many ways, the institution adapted: new
          journals, such as the <cite class="title italic">Electronic Book Review</cite>, emerged as
          open-access e-journals. Print journals, such as <cite class="title italic">Genders</cite>,
          followed suit and were reborn in cyberspace. Brave, forward-looking deans, provosts, and
          grant-giving agencies like the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National
          Science Foundation threw money at multimedia and web-based projects that promised to
          revolutionize the way that scholarly knowledge is presented and circulated.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This institutional interest in exploring the possibilities for digital scholarship, after
          an initial flurry of activity followed by something of a hiatus, seems to be gaining
          impetus again. We have recently seen the establishment of new granting initiatives (such
          as the NEH’s Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants and the ACLS Digital Innovation Fellowship
          Program) as well as a general "buzz" about digital scholarship
          epitomized by recent articles in the <cite class="title italic">Chronicle of Higher
            Education</cite> and elsewhere, culminating in a standing room only panels on digital
          humanities at the MLA conferences of 2009 and 2010, and the awarding of the MLA’s 2009
          first book prize to <cite class="title italic">Mechanisms</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>], a seminal book on new media forensics. Innovative work,
          such as that sponsored by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH),
          MediaCommons, and the journal <cite class="title italic">Vectors</cite>, is gaining ground
          among a growing cohort of digital scholars. Despite these promising developments over the
          last decade, however, academia itself has been slow to respond to the changing face of
          scholarly practice when it comes to issues of promotion and tenure, peer-review, funding,
          and faculty development, and more broadly in recognizing the emerging importance of
          scholarly multimedia. In this respect, academia seems to suffer from its own version of
          technological obsolescence, seeing the emergence of scholarly multimedia as challenging
          the primacy of traditional humanities scholarship.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">This article considers the historically important role that new media have played in
          configuring not just articulations of humanist subjectivity in general (a now well-trodden
          field in literary and cultural studies), but also the humanist <em class="emph">scholarly</em>
          subject. By placing the institutional tensions between traditional scholarly practice and
          new media within larger theoretical and disciplinary contexts, we can demonstrate how new
          media challenges the ways in which the traditional humanities scholar has been imagined as
          having a secure and stable position within institutionalized hierarchies of knowledge
          production. Furthermore, we can consider how scholarly multimedia threatens the very
          coherence of humanities scholarship by insisting on the re-embodiment of scholarly
          activity. In this respect, we hope to bring critiques of techno-scientific epistemologies
          coming out of new media and science studies to bear on humanities scholarship in order to
          follow through on Donna Haraway’s call for interventions into all forms of knowledge
          production: "Knowledge-making technologies, including crafting
              subject positions and ways of inhabiting such positions, must be made relentlessly
              visible and open to critical intervention" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#haraway2004">#haraway2004</a></span>. Our analysis will reveal the ways in which
          the production of scholarly multimedia has been hampered by two key obstacles:
          traditionalist definitions of humanities scholarship that still overwhelmingly determine
          the evaluation of digital works, and a narrow understanding of what the
            "materiality" of new media can actually come to mean. We hope to
          address both of these issues by foregrounding some of the material and intellectual
          potentialities revealed by scholarly multimedia.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Scholarly Multimedia: Defining an Emerging Genre</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Scholarly multimedia in the humanities has, historically, gone by many names: digital
          humanities, humanities computing, and more recently new media scholarship. Each of these
          names points to the technological aspects of this new mode of scholarship, and thus
          acknowledges the vital importance of medium to scholarly activity. In literary studies,
          media scholarship has for the most part diverged into two basic fields of study. On the
          one hand, we have traditional text-based readings of innovative literary forms, usually
          referred to as <em class="term">new media studies</em>. N. Katherine Halyes, among others, has
          pioneered this important field.<a class="noteRef" href="#d24606e156">[1]</a> On the other hand, we have
          digital reimaginings of or interventions into preexisting text manuscripts, such as the
          William Blake Archive and Emily Dickinson Electronic Archives. These works are usually
          gathered under the title of <em class="term">digital humanities</em> or <em class="term">humanities
            computing</em>. This division between analysis of new media and digital archiving has
          been accompanied by an equally notable split in tenure and promotion evaluation, wherein
          scholarship <em class="emph">about</em> new media, in the form of single-author monographs,
            "counts," while multimedia projects themselves, no matter how
          transformative, are viewed (if the scholar is lucky) as akin to producing a somewhat
          gimmicky scholarly edition — i.e. the "work" is primarily viewed as
          reformatting rather than as "original" scholarship. The important work
          of digital preservation of existing texts, itself a crucial field, is more likely to be
          considered the province of library science than that of Literature and the Humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Spearheaded by the Electronic Literature Organization, scholars in the digital humanities
          are now starting to explore some of the technical and rhetorical problems of approaching
          and preserving "born digital" creative works — interactive Flash poems,
          hypertext novels, and the like — which never existed in print. But what about
            "born digital"<em class="emph">scholarship</em> — scholarship that never had a print analog? Very few theorists
          have attended to this category, being mostly concerned with digital creative works as
          their object of analysis, rather than digitally rendered scholarly works. Thus the work of
          new media researchers in the humanities tends to get lumped into a single category rather
          than, as Cheryl Ball distinguishes, into the very distinct categories of scholarship
          rendered <em class="emph">in</em> new media and scholarship <em class="emph">about</em> new media [<a class="ref" href="#ball2004">Ball 2004</a>, 404]. Institutionally, this distinction is crucial for
          upcoming scholars, since much of the contention centers around <em class="term">originality</em> of
          content: if the multimedia format of the work is absolutely essential to (and constitutive
          of) the argument it presents, where should it count — as a work of scholarship as
          fundamentally complex as a written monograph, or as a reworking of an existing argument (a
            <em class="term">porting</em>, if you like — a term we borrow from software development
          practices)? Thus it is important to distinguish, as we do here, between the term
            <em class="term">scholarly multimedia</em> and other terms frequently used in considerations of
          the role of new media in academic contexts. By scholarly multimedia we specifically mean
          critical scholarly works — interpretive and argumentative, as opposed to creative or
          archival — that are produced, and in some cases performed, in multimedia form. These works
          represent a new rhetorical genre of scholarship that is at once both discursive and
          embodied, and that differs from multimedia art or hypertext fiction (as artistic and
          literary genres) and from multimedia as interactive storage spaces for archival materials
          or critical resources.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The messy contention over how to define scholarly multimedia is symptomatic of the very
          old argument, played out continually in the academy, over a perceived split between form
          and content. Content is the essence of analysis, while form is merely the
            "matter" out of which it is made. But materiality matters — has
          always mattered — in the meaning-constitution of analysis. Digital machines, in all their
          undeniable physicality, confront us as a transformational tool in the same way that the
          printing press does. In this way, we see, from the earliest writings about the role of
          computers in humanities scholarship, an awareness of materiality. In the fields commonly
          known as "history of the book" or "print
            culture," critics have devoted considerable attention to the materiality and
          visual spatiality of the scholarly artifact – the illuminated manuscript, the Concrete
          poem, the hypertext novel, etc. In the analysis of the many forms new media take, <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#drucker2002">#drucker2002</a></span>, [<a class="ref" href="#hockey2000">Hockey 2000</a>], and <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2004">#mcgann2004</a></span>
          serve as excellent examples, as does N. Katherine Hayles in her call for "media-specific analysis" and later "New
            Materialism," a mode of literary criticism that takes seriously the material
          instantiation of the text as integral to critical interpretation ([<a class="ref" href="#hayles2002">Hayles 2002</a>, 29]; [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2005">Hayles 2005</a>, 142]). Critics have
          also attended to the body of the reader as an important locus of materiality, arguing, as
          Mark Hansen does, that readers engaged with new media experience the text/artifact in an
          embodied, post-representationalist way; that is to say, new media produces in the
          user/reader "affects" that cannot be separated from material embodiment
            <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>. But the importance of the material conditions of
          multimedia <em class="emph">production</em>, i.e. the embodied and materially-mediated work of the
          digital author has remained drastically under-theorized.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Our goal here is to extend the discourse of new media criticism by addressing
          specifically the materiality of scholarly production, both in print and multimedia form.
          That is, we hope to attend not only to the bodies of the text and the user/reader, but
          also to the bodies of the authors/engineers and to the material aspects of scholarly
          activity itself. Crucially, we want to focus on the material and embodied aspects of
          multimedia production, rather than simply the rhetorical arrangements or rearrangements of
          information that are so often considered the primary labor of multimedia authoring. In
          this mode, it is important to distinguish between material labor and embodied labor.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">For us, <em class="term">material labor</em> is a broad term encompassing both physical movement
          and the kinds of "material" actions necessary to provide an
          infrastructure for digital media. On an immediate level, these actions can be thought of
          as a nodal network of bodies and machines in which machines <em class="emph">combine with</em>
          humans to perform tasks: the manipulation of software packages, the shooting and
          compression of video, the recording and recasting of audio. In addition, we have the even
          wider infrastructural support necessary for producing such media objects: the
          institutional search for grants, the subvention of copyright clearances, the securing of
          financial support for and mentoring of graduate students, and technical assistance
          provided by, variously, presses, contract programmers, videographers, and animators.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">By <em class="term">embodied labor</em>, more narrowly, we mean the physical actions (often
          disciplined by machinic interactions) that go into interacting with machines — the
          focusing of the eye on the screen, the repetitive hand movement, the response of the ear
          to input, and the performative bodily movements when interacting with machines as physical
          objects. This distinction will be crucial when we come later in the article to a
          discussion of the most radical forms of scholarly multimedia currently being conducted in
          the academy — performative scholarship.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Purification and the Problem of Material Rhetorics</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">A host of binary oppositions emerges when we reflect on the unusual space scholarly
          multimedia occupies within the academy, particularly within the humanities: content versus
          form, information versus materiality, multimedia versus print, collaboration versus
          single-authorship, nodal or networked "writing" versus linear academic
          prose, word versus image, and so on. These binaries are often cited as arguments for the
          line we draw between print and new media as well as between intellectual labor (often seen

          producing scholarly works. But such binaries are by no means sustainable, and lead to a
          proliferation of hybrids, in the Latourian sense, as the labor practices of academics who
          work in multimedia have become more and more visible as embodied material practices.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">In Bruno Latour’s articulation of the modern constitution, he offers
            <em class="term">purification</em> as a term to describe the institutional practice of vigorously
          separating the domain of the social from the domain of nature. But this practice of
          purification is met with resistance as there continue to arise objects (and by extension
          practices) that refuse to be easily contained within one or the other of these purified
          domains. Modernity attempts to subsume such unrulqy "quasi-objects" or hybrids by characterizing them as "a
            mixture of two pure forms," so that rather than tearing at the fabric of
          modernity’s stable ontology, they reinforce the purified domains of the material and the
          social that constitute modernity [<a class="ref" href="#latour1993">Latour 1993</a>, 78]. The consequence of
          this dual process of purification and mediation (Latour also calls this mixing of domains
            "translation") is a frustration with modern philosophy’s
          incapacity to account for the proliferation of hybrids other than by resorting to a
          pernicious relativism at the expense of more nuanced accounts of the relationship between
          materiality and cultural productions. Within the academy we see these processes of
          purification and mediation at work, producing and maintaining the distinction between
          intellectual labor and material labor, both of which are essential to multimedia
          production.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">The distinction between intellectual and material labor is pervasive throughout scholarly

          conditions. In addition, any discussion of scholarly activities in multimedia format are
          usually elided in favor of literary texts, which can be safely analyzed using traditional
          tools of critical analysis. Thus early criticism of hypertext, for example, focuses on its
          rhetorical difference as a reading and writing practice. However, critics of this early
          celebration of hypertext generally point out the ways that print conventions have
            <em class="emph">always</em> been associative, non-linear, and intertextual, citing footnoting
          and indexing as examples of the always already hypertextual nature of print. Richard
          Grusin, for one, demonstrates how ascribing revolutionary qualities to electronic writing
          is tantamount to a technological fallacy whereby we ascribe agency to technology itself
          rather than attending to the ways in which writing is always produced in particular
          historical, social, and technological contexts. In this way, he asserts, rather
          paradoxically, that electronic authorship is the same as print authorship only different:
              "To then imagine that current technologies of (and like)
              writing are destabilized by pointing out that they have histories is only to suggest
              that since things used to be different, they could be again" [<a class="ref" href="#grusin1996">Grusin 1996</a>, 52].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Some attempts have been made to reintroduce the material world into new media texts. In a

          contradiction pervasive in media criticism. Aarseth’s project, he claims, is to create a
          space within literary theory that can account for new media technologies. At the same
          time, however, Aarseth dismisses new media technologies as "not
            important in themselves" in order to favor a reader/user-centered approach to
          cybertext that disregards media-specific rhetorics and aesthetics, both of which, implies
          Aarseth, are superficial: "The ideological forces surrounding new
              technology produce a rhetoric of novelty, differentiation, and freedom that works to
              obscure the more profound structural kinships between superficially heterogeneous
              media" [<a class="ref" href="#aarseth1997">Aarseth 1997</a>, 14]. By focusing on the role of the reader in
          the construction of meaning, regardless of the medium in which meaning is delivered, and
          by redefining writing itself as a "material machine" (and
          therefore only superficially different from new media) Aarseth dismisses arguments for
          cybertexts’ newness as being premised on extraneous distinctions [<a class="ref" href="#aarseth1997">Aarseth 1997</a>, 18–24]. In this way, Aarseth levels the field between
          digital and non-digital literary objects and redefines <em class="term">cybertext</em>, not in

                <em class="emph">perspective</em> on all forms of textuality" [<a class="ref" href="#aarseth1997">Aarseth 1997</a>, 18]. This view fails, however, to account for
          actual material and technical differences between media, as well as the material-social
          differences (i.e. in the skills and knowledges required to produce such works) that
          necessitate a more nuanced account of new media as facilitating new rhetorical modes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">More recent criticism has begun to grapple with the idea of media writing as a practice
          that is embedded in <em class="emph">both</em> rhetorical and material networks of machine and

            constitution" in terms of the purifying impulses that "dichotomize our experiences with visual and verbal communication systems" [<a class="ref" href="#hocks2003">Hocks &amp; Kendrick 2003</a>, 3]. The binary that emerges within the humanities
          between word and image points to a larger constitutional dichotomy between old modes of
          scholarly practice and new modes. This dichotomy, often described in critical discourse as
          a contest among media<a class="noteRef" href="#d24606e350">[2]</a>, produces two contradictory purification narratives, the first being
          overstated claims of new media’s radical newness and the second being claims of its
          radical sameness. Early enthusiasts of hypertext, Michelle Kendrick points out, have
          claimed that electronic writing, by embedding technologically associative structures in a
          non-linear way, function more like the natural human brain than the artificial medium of
          print. In this way, hypertext enthusiasts have claimed that new media "truly reveals the subject, for it enacts the patterns of cognition in
              the human mind[…]" [<a class="ref" href="#kendrick2001">Kendrick 2001</a>, 233]. Such claims, Kendrick writes, rely on the
          notion that the subject of writing in print culture has been rendered obsolete by the
          emergence of new media [<a class="ref" href="#kendrick2001">Kendrick 2001</a>, 233].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">This ongoing debate about new media’s functional (and in some cases even biological)
          difference from old media contributes to a double erasure, for scholars working in
          multimedia, of both their intellectual contributions and their material labor. If
          multimedia is regarded as no different from other scholarly forms, the complex labor
          practices and new knowledges required to produce scholarly works of multimedia, such as
          interface design, coding, video production, hardware support, institutional interactions
          and so on, may be devalued to the extent that they are seen more as service (akin to
          maintaining a department’s computer lab or website) or not seen as meaningful scholarly
          activity at all. This leads to the reduction of scholarly multimedia to the status of
            "unacademic," suggesting that it is somehow less intellectually
          significant than "equivalent" works produced in print because the
          differences between media are "superficial." Here we find ourselves in
          a bind similar to the "old/new" argument. On the one hand, if
          we claim that digital scholarship is old scholarship translated to a new format, we elide
          the ways in which multimedia fundamentally changes scholarly argument; on the other hand,
          if we regard multimedia as radically other to scholarly production (i.e.
            "new"), the intellectual and rhetorical expertise of multimedia
          authors/engineers may also be discredited insofar as they are working in a medium not
          recognized within the institution as scholarly enough. Furthermore, as a consequence of
          casting academic labor practices in these ways, the material practices of <em class="emph">all</em>
          scholarship are erased, as traditional scholarship is purified as a solely intellectual
          act. Narratives of purification that dictate which scholarly practices count as
          intellectually significant and which don’t foreclose the possibility of accounting for
          multimedia as a viable scholarly activity and limit our understanding of how scholarly
          activity more generally is socially and technologically constructed.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Old Media and New Media: The Problem of (Scholarly) Humanism</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">The emergence within the academy of scholarly multimedia as a new rhetorical genre is
          certainly not the first time that technological change has prompted anxious
          reconsiderations of humanism. Rather, it exists as one localized example of an ongoing
          concern about the status of the human in relation to technology. In <cite class="title italic">Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</cite>, Friedrich A. Kittler argues that media threaten,
          indeed have always threatened, to render the liberal humanist (and by extension, we would
          argue, the humanist scholar) obsolete [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>]. According to Kittler,
          prior to the invention of devices such as the phonograph that could record sound waves,
          writing was imagined as the only means to transmit the voice of the author. In this
          respect, the voice of the author, as it was imagined by readers, functioned as a kind of
              "fictitious elevated phallus born from the alphabet" [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>, 70]. With early recording devices, the modern
          engineer was able to capture the waves of human vocalizations and could thus reproduce
          this "fictitious phallus" technologically, calling into
          question the purity of the phallic voice. Kittler elaborates on this in his discussion of
          Rilke in which Rilke describes phonographic emanations as "primal
            sounds." In other words, phonographic recordings, which seem to capture the human
          voice "as it really is," offered the illusion of primacy
          (immediacy) and in this way appear to outperform the written word: <blockquote><p>With the demise of writing’s storage monopoly comes to an end a love that
              was not only one of literature’s many possible subjects but also its very own media
              technology: since 1800 perfectly alphabetized female readers have been able to endow
              letters with a beloved voice. But tracing primal sounds has, as Rilke put it, nothing
              to do with "the presence of mind and grace of
              love". [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>, 70]</p></blockquote> In this passage, we see a crucial split
          between mind and body take shape: "machines have taken over the
              function of the central nervous system" [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>, 51]. Machines are primal and embodied and
          therefore threaten the subject of writing. Suddenly, with the emerging importance of the
          machine engineer, there is the capacity for writing without a subject-author, and so the
          role of the subject-author is no longer entirely stable. One important consequence of
          machines taking over the function of the central nervous system is that, for the first
          time, memory suqpersedes "spirit" as the imminent
          characteristic of subjectivity, yet memory is no longer solely the domain of the mind or
          brain. It can also be scratched on surfaces. Memory has now been externalized by media
          technologies. The consequence of this externalization of memory, Kittler argues rather
          dramatically, is that "Media render Man[…]superfluous[…]The
              fictional elevated phallus shrivels up[…]the engineer has finally beaten the
              author" [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>, 78]. As Kittler’s historical analysis reveals,
          this perceived contest between media technologies (captured here through the figure of the
          engineer) and the liberal humanist subject-as-author (presumed here to be male or at least
          to possess the phallus) is ongoing. More interestingly, we see this contest structured
          around yet another series of dichotomous relations: author versus engineer, soul versus
          memory, writing versus recording, humanities (e.g. the poetry of Rilke) versus science and
          technology (e.g. phonographic recordings), and ultimately, mind versus body.<a class="noteRef" href="#d24606e452">[3]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">In "The Condition of Virtuality"[<a class="ref" href="#hayles1999a">Hayles 1999a</a>] and <cite class="title italic">How We Became Posthuman</cite><span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hayles1999b">#hayles1999b</a></span>, N. Katherine Hayles’ offers a similar narrative of the
          emergence of the tension between mind and body, which she casts as a tension between
          virtuality and materiality. As a result of post-World War II scientific discoveries
          (namely, DNA and genetic code) we (meaning Westerners) have experienced a paradigm shift
          in the ways we imaginCe the "self." Whereas prior to these discoveries
          we imagined the material body and the "self." as a unified,
          self-identical whole (this is what Hayles calls humanism), in the post-DNA age the body is
          re-imagined as a container or husk for the self, which is itself re-imagined as an
          informational pattern produced by and through genetic code. Hence, writes Hayles, we see
          the emergence of a posthuman dialectic — information versus materiality — where the former
          trumps the latter as the root cause of the (illusion of the) liberal humanist subject.
            "A defining characteristic of the present cultural moment,"
          Hayles writes, "is the belief that information can circulate
              unchanged among different material substrates" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hayles1999b">#hayles1999b</a></span>. The body, in such a posthuman arrangement,
          becomes the "original prosthesis" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hayles1999b">#hayles1999b</a></span>. This ongoing tension between materiality and
          informatics contributes to our understanding of how we in the academy think about
          multimedia in relation to other, more "legitimized" modes of scholarly
          practice. For one, the materiality of multimedia scholarship is constantly under erasure
          insofar as we imagine that the heart of any scholarly work (the intellectual part) is
          purely "informational," as if, like Athena, it springs forth from the
          scholar’s mind and takes up residency inside the book or article or machine. Hayles,
          drawing on Richard Doyle, calls it an "impossible inversion,"
          where the informational pattern or code is imagined as actually producing the thing on
          which the pattern nonetheless depends <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hayles1999b">#hayles1999b</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">In the case of humanities scholarship and the methods by which we evaluate and validate
          research practices, Hayles’ "impossible inversion" surfaces as
          a practice of purification wherein the embodied or material aspects of scholarly work are
          rendered secondary to (rather than constitutive of) scholarly argument. We imagine that
          the intellectual content of scholarship pre-exists its material enactment. Deborah Lines
          Andersen, in her introduction to <cite class="title italic">Digital Scholarship in the Tenure,
            Promotion, and Review Process</cite>, reiterates this view: <blockquote><p>The critical issue in academe is what one does with what one has. It is the act of
              creation that defines the digital scholar. Tools such as computers and software
              programs are critical to this creation, but they are only the means to this
              end. [<a class="ref" href="#andersen2004">Andersen 2004</a>, 3]</p></blockquote> While <cite class="title italic">Digital
            Scholarship</cite> is a valuable and ground-breaking discussion of the institutional
          problems faced by those working in multimedia, Andersen’s attempt to define digital
          scholarship as independent from the medium in which it is produced tends to undermine her
          argument for the value of digital work. We should be mindful, then, of Hayles’ criticism
          of similar virtualist accounts that disregard the material substrates upon which
          informational patterns depend. Perhaps understandably, given its computational origins,
          Andersen sees digital scholarship as better suited to natural or social sciences where
          research tends to be presented graphically (for example, in the form of maps or charts) or
          quantitatively. She does her best to argue for the application of these existing strengths
          to a wider range of cultural materials. <blockquote><p>Arts, languages,
              literature, philosophy, and religion have not naturally embraced digital scholarship
              in the ways exhibited by scientists and social scientists. There are a variety of very
              good reasons for this resistance. Foremost among these reasons is the type of material
              humanists study. Diaries, plays, music scores, novels, paintings, religious works, and
              philosophical treatises, to name a few, do not lend themselves to
              quantification. [<a class="ref" href="#andersen2004">Andersen 2004</a>, 9]</p></blockquote> Along with arts, languages, literature,
          philosophy, and religion, we might add film studies, visual culture, cultural studies,
          science studies, and new media, all of which lend themselves quite well to scholarly
          analyses using multimedia precisely because they are not constrained by the purely
          textual.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">More to the point, this view fails to account for versions of scholarly multimedia,
          particularly within the humanities, that do <em class="emph">more</em> than facilitate textual or
          rhetorical analyses of print literature or art objects through the use of a computer. In
          part, Andersen’s restrictive view of digital scholarship within the humanities stems from
          an historically narrow understanding of the diversity of humanities research as
          fundamentally ancillary to the text, rather than transformative. Certainly Andersen is not
          alone in her assumptions about the meaning of digital scholarship within the humanities,
          nor is such an argument without value for the crucial scholarship of digital annotation,
          translation and preservation. Again, [<a class="ref" href="#hockey2000">Hockey 2000</a>], <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#drucker2002">#drucker2002</a></span>, and <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2004">#mcgann2004</a></span> are among those who imagine
          media technologies as useful to humanities scholars insofar as they facilitate the
          capturing, cataloging, and indexing of "electronic texts," and
          rightly so [<a class="ref" href="#hockey2000">Hockey 2000</a>, 1]. And while we recognize the crucial value
          in this practical application of technology, we resist the argument that electronic
          archival work offers a totalizing view of the possibilities offered by digital humanities.
          Such a limiting perspective reveals precisely the sort of virtualism that, as Hayles
          points out, relies on the unusual notion that information can exist independently of its
          medium: <blockquote><p>The illusion that information is separate from
              materiality leads not only to a dangerous split between information and meaning but
              also to a flattening of the space of theoretical inquiry. If we accept that the
              materiality of the world is immaterial to our concerns, we are likely to miss the very
              complexities that theory at its best tries to excavate and understand. [<a class="ref" href="#hayles1999a">Hayles 1999a</a>, 30]</p></blockquote> This passage from Hayles bolsters her claim
          that literature <em class="emph">itself</em> is undergoing a revolution as a result of digital
          technologies and that, as literary critics, we must confront these changes by
          incorporating an awareness of a text’s materiality into our analyses. We would extend this
          argument to suggest that the very practices of literary and cultural analysis are
          undergoing a parallel revolution and that we must also confront these changes and embrace
          the full potential of multimedia as a rich, complex scholarly medium. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">How Scholarly Media Restructure Intellectual Work</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">All of these discussions, from the early hypertextual emphasis on the newness of

          embeddedness of media that must accompany any evaluation of what it means to be a digital

          to argue for the value of multimedia work in the academic milieu, we must confront the
          physicality of rhetorical practices themselves. On the most physical level: what can we
          make, given the material constraints of the machines we work with? And on the rhetorical
          level: what can we argue (or not argue) given the structures we're given to work with
          (software packages, database design) which are themselves constrained by issues of memory
          storage, drive and processing speed? But most importantly: why and how does the academy
          seek to constantly devalue the work we do as multimedia scholars by casting it as
          instrumental practices of rhetorical and material labor, rather than the intellectual
          practices of analysis and criticism – and what can we do about this perception?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Addressing these important issues requires, first, that we break open our understanding
          of what scholarly multimedia is and can become. Andersen’s primary example of digital
          humanities scholarship consists of digitizing Jane Austen’s work in its entirety in order
          to perform database queries of main characters. As Andersen points out, this is hardly an
          appropriate or efficient scholarly use of computing technology. But then again, computer
          assisted textual analysis, while valuable, is not the only role computing plays within the
          humanities, and such a view ignores recent (and not so recent) forays into argument-driven
          scholarly multimedia, notably a number of academic presses who have experimented with

          and thus at least benefit from the fetishization so readily apparent in the academy of the
          print document as a physical form. More recent works in multimedia (mostly web-based
          works) confound even this basic understanding of what constitutes a
            "text." Roderick Coover’s <cite class="title italic">Voyage Into the

          many non-"publishable" but infrastructural multimedia projects

          one case in point, consider Marcel O’Gorman’s <cite class="title italic">Dreadmill</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#ogorman2005">O’Gorman 2005</a>]. Described as "Critique, Performance, Installation,
            Education," this unruly hybrid of art performance, argument and exposition is by
          far one of the most provocative examples to date of a re-embodiment of humanities
          scholarship. While running on a treadmill that generates a multimedia display, O’Gorman
          critiques our culture’s increasing denial of the body and our increasingly sedentary
          lifestyles. He delivers a smart, theoretically informed presentation about the
          relationships between technology, death, violence, mobility, consumerism, corporeality,
          disability, and even nationality and national borders. The entire performance lasts about
          one hour.</div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000102/resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000102/resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt="Screenshot of O'Gorman's onstage performance."/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>Marcel O'Gorman performing <cite class="title italic">Dreadmill</cite>,

            "publishable" in any traditional sense, though the ideas are
          sophisticated enough in that respect. Most troubling, to the academy, is the fact that it
          would be impossible to disentangle the content of <cite class="title italic">Dreadmill</cite>
          from its delivery medium — its dynamic presentation. It is certainly more than a
          conference presentation. And while O’Gorman is an artist among other things, <cite class="title italic">Dreadmill</cite> isn’t easily classified as an art installation. For one,
          unlike other somewhat famous "body artists" like Stelarc, <cite class="title italic">Dreadmill</cite> is not just about manipulating the body in visually
          provocative or sensual ways. While running, O’Gorman delivers a thesis-driven academic
          argument. He cites Nietzsche, Kittler, Virilio, Haraway, Ernest Becker, among other
          scholars. In all aspects, <cite class="title italic">Dreadmill</cite> represents a new frontier
          in reimagining humanities scholarship. It also foregrounds the roles of both multimedia
          and physical bodies in the practice of humanities scholarship where the stakes of that
          scholarship are no less than (bodily) death and (intellectual) obsolescence.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">Jay David Bolter has suggested that theoretically informed multimedia performances such
          as O’Gorman’s <cite class="title italic">Dreadmill</cite> are often the products of new media
          artists and thus are only tangentially related to the academy [<a class="ref" href="#bolter2000">Bolter &amp; Grusin 2000</a>, 24]. He points this out in order to argue that a key dichotomy that takes shape
          within the academy is that of theory versus practice (which, of course, is another
          deployment of the mind/body dichotomy). While this divide between theory and practice may
          have been clearly in place in the past, performative scholarship such as O’Gorman’s
          threatens the integrity of precisely such a divide. O’Gorman’s status as an academic as
          well as new media artist is well established; he has been a tenured Associate Professor of
          English at the University of Detroit Mercy; he is now in the Department of English at the University of Waterloo, where he also directs the <a class="ref" href="http://criticalmedia.uwaterloo.ca/" onclick="window.open('http://criticalmedia.uwaterloo.ca/'); return false">Critical Media Lab</a>. In other words, as both a multimedia
          performance artist and scholar, O’Gorman embodies a new kind of academic professional — a
          cyborg scholar — who answers Bolter’s call, that "media theory
              engage with the practice of digital media" [<a class="ref" href="#bolter2000">Bolter &amp; Grusin 2000</a>, 25]. O’Gorman demonstrates the kind of hybrid
          scholarship possible in our current digital age, in which the tools available to
          humanities scholars extend far beyond the textual to include the material, the technical,
          and the rhetorical (not to be confused with the textual). Gregory VanHoosier-Carey and
          Ellen Strain, practitioners of scholarly multimedia themselves, frame these new
          potentialities offered by new media in terms of interface design which they site as an
          often invisible locus of rhetoric praxis. Interface design, they argue, creates
              "architected meaning, an arena within which the demonstration
              of humanities methodologies can take on a dynamic form" [<a class="ref" href="#strain2003">Strain &amp; VanHoosier-Carey 2003</a>, 259].</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">"Selling" New Media: the Problem of Genre and Tenure</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Confusion within the institution over how to categorize and evaluate scholarly multimedia

          larger problem within the institution to reckon with the emergence of new media,
          particularly at the level of promotion and tenure where the traditional model of
          humanities scholarship as intellectual labor dominates. According to this traditional
          model, a scholarly publication in an online journal, even if the writing itself was
          performed on a word processor, "counts" as digital scholarship
          primarily because it can be easily be measured according to traditional print standards:
          is the journal peer-reviewed? Does the journal have a reputation of being intellectually
          rigorous? While such online publications, which have significant merit in their own right,
          are in the practical sense digital, they don’t necessarily depart significantly from
          print-based journals. Nonetheless, e-journal articles are often devalued for the simple
          reason that they do not appear in print form.<a class="noteRef" href="#d24606e699">[5]</a> By
          relying on this older and, frankly, obsolete model for defining and evaluating
          scholarship, we continue to privilege content over form, intellectual labor over physical
          labor, and print over digital media.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">Scholars working in multimedia have been forced to reckon with this problem and must
          continue to engage with fundamentally conservative analogies to argue for the scholarly
          merit of the project. The first project in Penn Press’ <cite class="title italic">Mariner10</cite> series, <cite class="title italic">Red Planet</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#markley2001">Markley et al. 2001</a>], led by Robert Markley (at some professional risk) had to be
            "pitched" to presses, granting agencies, and fellow colleagues as a
          multimedia version of a scholarly book. The argument necessary to secure publication and
          scholarly credibility even took the form of equating the storage capacity of a DVD-ROM to
          the thickness of a book: "This storage capacity means that a
              DVD-ROM can hold several hours of high-resolution video, the equivalent of a book
              ninety feet thick…" [<a class="ref" href="#burgess2003">Burgess et al. 2003</a>, 67–68]. While describing the project in terms of
          such an equivalence seemed a necessary step at the time to gain entrance into the
          humanities scholarly canon in a way that would "matter," especially for
          collaborators who were untenured or still in graduate school, such a decision would also
          force the project’s authors to reconsider the implications of such a choice in terms of
          the politics of remediation. Were the authors really challenging the conventions of
          humanities scholarship by producing such a work of multimedia, or were they hampered by
          old standards for what counts as legitimate scholarship? Were they, by claiming to
          remediate the scholarly book, limiting the potential of what we were already recognizing
          as a new and valuable rhetorical genre? The answer to this last question is certainly yes,
          and points to <cite class="title italic">Red Planet</cite> as a first-generation (and
          conservative, given what can be done with the form) work of scholarly multimedia.
          Nonetheless, much was gained by working through the institutional and rhetorical
          challenges that multimedia practitioners face in articulating the significance of their
          scholarly activities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">As we have suggested, scholarly multimedia has often been situated outside of the
          traditional model of scholarly activity insofar as its practitioners participate in a host
          of activities rarely recognized as "intellectually significant."
          Coding, shooting and editing digital video, interface and information design, data-basing,
          troubleshooting, debugging: these activities often fall outside the purview of traditional
          notions of humanities scholarship. In a supreme irony, it is only after the project has
          itself become the object of critical inquiry, for instance in a scholarly print article
          reflecting on the visual rhetorics of multimedia design, do these activities come into
          view. Two examples of such post-production publications include, as we have previously
          mentioned, "The Dialogics of New Media: Video, Visualization, and
            Narrative in Red Planet: Scientific and Cultural Encounters with <cite class="title italic">Mars</cite>"[<a class="ref" href="#burgess2003">Burgess et al. 2003</a>], as well as "Eloquent Interfaces:
            Humanities-Based Analysis in the Age of Hypermedia"[<a class="ref" href="#strain2003">Strain &amp; VanHoosier-Carey 2003</a>]. In both articles, which appear in <cite class="title italic">Eloquent Images: Writing Visually in New Media</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#hocks2003">Hocks &amp; Kendrick 2003</a>], authors reflect critically on their collaborative multimedia
          projects; thus the articles bear two crucial markers. First, they offer a kind of
          testimonial of the work accomplished in the multimedia project itself, explaining some of
          the works’ features, and some of the authors’ technical choices; Second, the articles
          argue for the importance of the combined intellectual and material labor practices that
          went into the multimedia projects. These characteristics of early articles about the
          practice of scholarly multimedia suggest rather strongly that multimedia is a rich medium
          in which to work. However, these articles also demonstrate that, at the time of their
          publication, it still seemed necessary to argue aggressively for the merits of multimedia
          as a new scholarly genre, suggesting that multimedia remained, and continues to remain,
          outside of accepted definitions of what counts as legitimate scholarship. This perception
          of the need to defend the significant and unique contributions of multimedia has been of
          particular concern for scholars who have embraced multimedia production as their primary
          research activity despite obvious professional challenges and risks. More importantly, the
          emergence of scholarly multimedia points to a fundamental conflict between traditional
          views of the humanities scholar and the new digital scholar who threatens to reveal the
          former’s purchase on reality.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">One way to trace the origins of the traditionalist view is to situate evaluations of
          humanities research in terms of its perceived difference from natural or social sciences
          research. Multimedia, because it relies overtly on digital technologies, has been
          historically situated in an intermediary position between these two disciplines. The
          definition of digital scholarship offered by the traditional model depends on seeing
          scientific research as quantitative and graphical and humanities research as textual
          and/or rhetorical. Even when humanities scholarship does make use of visual or graphical
          content, for instance in art history, the graphical nature of the scholarship is commonly
          viewed as the subject of the investigation (akin to scientific data) rather than a
          rhetorical or research tool (akin to a graphical representation of the data). Scholarly
          multimedia, on the other hand, relies heavily on graphical interfaces, navigational
          schemas, and visual layout as well as text as essential rhetorical tools for the
          construction of arguments and the production of meaning. In this way, multimedia occupies
          a liminal space between or even beyond science and humanities as a new mode of scholarship
          and is, as a consequence, battered by traditional definitions of what constitutes
            <em class="term">research</em> within the humanities. Is research found in the production stage
          or embodied within the final new media object? Is it the rhetorical analysis one produces
          as part of the multimedia work, or the analysis one writes about the production process,
          or the rhetorical analysis one writes about the new media object? Ironically, because new
          media work has been so hampered by accepted models of humanities scholarship that
          privilege content over form and intellectual labor over technical labor, the temptation
          exists to see print-articles or books about multimedia as more valid than the multimedia
          work itself. In fact, a host of well-known "multimedia" scholars have
          themselves never actually practiced multimedia. This is by no means to suggest that
          scholarship <em class="emph">about</em> multimedia is not valid or important or that all critics of
          multimedia must, themselves, become practitioners (in the same way that we would not
          expect literary critics to also become poets or novelists). Rather, we should take care
          not to confuse storage medium (book versus multimedia) with rhetorical genre (book versus
          multimedia) lest we fall into the trap of technological determinism, or worse,
          technophobia, when evaluating the merits of a scholarly work.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">One way to draw ourselves out of this bind is to pay attention to the key overlap between
          representationalism (what humanities scholars are assumed to do) and performativity (what
          bodies and machines are assumed to do) in the context of the technologies we work with in
          producing multimedia. In <cite class="title italic">Embodying Technesis</cite>, and later in
            <cite class="title italic">Bodies in Code</cite>, Mark Hansen calls for a deeper
          understanding of the role embodiment plays in producing reality ([<a class="ref" href="#hansen2000">Hansen 2000</a>], <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>). At the same time, he argues, we must develop a more
          robust, materialist account of the ontological role of technology. Technological change,
          he states, is so foundational to human experience that it has taken on an "extracultural, extrasocial dimension" [<a class="ref" href="#hansen2000">Hansen 2000</a>, 3]. This transformation invites us to reconsider
          technology in terms of its resistance to "explicit cultural
            thematization" or "representational capture" so that
          we can come to understand technology as an agent of "material
            complexification" that does not rely solely on cognition or human intervention
          for its evolution ([<a class="ref" href="#hansen2000">Hansen 2000</a>, 56], <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hansen2006">#hansen2006</a></span>).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Hansen’s argument in both books, that we must move beyond a representationalist
          understanding of humankind’s relationship to technology by focusing on embodiment,
          suggests that we should also rethink our own identity as scholars and intellectuals, in
          particular the ways in which our scholarly activities are bound up at a very deep level
          with the technologies we use to practice our craft. We believe scholarly multimedia offers
          a promising answer to Hansen’s call insofar as it can truly perform at the nexus of what
          Hayles calls our posthuman "mindbodies" [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2005">Hayles 2005</a>, 7]. Technology does not merely assist us as

          scholarly multimedia tends toward what Andrew Pickering calls the "performative idiom," a model that foregrounds the material agencies (both human

          we do at the material level, revealing that what has been overvalued all along is the
          immaterial, intellectual act that has often been conceived of as existing independently
          from social, institutional, and material contexts. In this respect, scholarly multimedia
          makes visible what Marcel O’Gorman calls the <em class="term">material remainder</em>, "the repressed technological element of humanities scholarship" [<a class="ref" href="#ogorman2006">O’Gorman 2006</a>, 6]. This material remainder includes the

          materiality of our own knowledge-productions: <blockquote><p>If the remainder is
              hidden or repressed, monstrous "other" of the conventional academic

          making visible the strategies that scholars employ to construct arguments that are valued
          for their capacity to produce closure and containment, and to construct a scholarly
          subject-of-writing as a hyper-rational, often-disembodied subject, a subject described by
          Bruno Latour in <cite class="title italic">Pandora’s Hope</cite> as a "mind-in-a-vat" [<a class="ref" href="#latour1999">Latour 1999</a>, 12]. The denial of the material remainder of
          writing is too horrible to contemplate for long: Latour’s formulation of a giant brain
          floating in a vat of fluid attached by wires to a CPU, or worse, a typewriter, or, still
          worse, pen and paper. A single pattern, a single brain, a single author alone in a small
          dark room, immersed in the gray matter of others who came before. This is the image
          cultivated by the notion of an "immaterial" disembodied humanities
          scholar resistant to rediscovering the materiality of his or her own activities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">In "Interactive Technology and the Remediation of the Subject of
            Writing," Michelle Kendrick writes that early critical discourse about the
          revolutionary nature of hypertext centered on its supposed ability to better reflect the
          way we think — in nonlinear, networked associations. Such claims, she argues, depend on a
          dubious double logic: that through its intensification of media technologies, hypertext
          erases mediation. "This double logic," Kendrick continues,
              "promises metaphysical transcendence, while paradoxically
              grounding such transcendence in technology’s materiality and specificity" [<a class="ref" href="#kendrick2001">Kendrick 2001</a>, 233]. Kendrick’s crucial insight, that all
          subjects-of-writing are produced by and through material-technological interventions,
          invites us to reconsider traditional print-based scholarship in order to uncover this
          double-logic. Her critique reveals the incoherence of the subject-of-writing that is
          covered over by media-specific strategies such as dense, esoteric, often impersonal
          academic prose, complex citation practices, as well as the conventions of
          single-authorship. Such strategies continue to set the standards by which we define and
          judge ourselves as scholars, and this evaluation is extended through the peer-review
          process as well as through the promotion and tenure process. Multimedia threatens to
          undermine the establishment of these standards, not because, as early hypertext
          enthusiasts claimed, it disperses the writing subject over vast networks or because it
          liberates the reader from the tyranny of the disembodied, single author. Rather, scholarly
          multimedia threatens to re-embody the heretofore disembodied intellectual by embracing a
          more performative mode or, to borrow from feminist philosopher of science Nancy Tuana, an
            <em class="emph">interactionist</em> mode of scholarly practice that emphasizes the "emergent interplay" between "human materiality
            and the materiality of the more than human"[<a class="ref" href="#tuana2001">Tuana 2001</a>, 221–223]. The multimedia scholar, by taking seriously the
          materiality of knowledge production, embodies an intellectual identity that is dispersed
          over material, rhetorical, and technical networks — a crucial transformation that must be
          acknowledged when assessing "what counts" as scholarly activity in the

            Mark Hansen, Friedrich Kittler, Jerome McGann — concerned with what they regard as a
            rivalry between new media and old media (comprising what Hayles has called the "new media ecology"). One form that this competition has taken
            among humanities scholars is what Hocks and Kendrick describe as the "new battleground between word and image," where word stands in
            for the old and image stands in for the new. Hocks and Kendrick point out, however, that
            word and image, like old and new media, have always operated dialogically, rather than
            dichotomously, in a "dynamic interplay" [<a class="ref" href="#hocks2003">Hocks &amp; Kendrick 2003</a>, 1]. Within the academy this supposed rivalry
            must also be seen as a convenient narrative that sutures over two underlying anxieties:
            anxiety of obsolescence among critics who perceive themselves as working in
              "old media," and on a more fundamental level, anxiety regarding the
            status of the human (and humanism, and the humanities) in relation to
          technology.</div><div class="endnote" id="d24606e452"><span class="noteRef">[3]</span>Willard

            the "genesis of new knowledge," yet not through scientific

            nor through a philosophical detachment from materiality [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2005">McCarty 2005</a>, 51]. The new media practitioner, as engineer, facilitates the
