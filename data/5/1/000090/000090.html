          and digital humanities. It comes not only with presumed technology or infrastructure, but
          also with certain assumptions, discursive patterns, and models. This paper analyzes these
          critically and advocates a humanities-based notion of cyberinfrastructure, not necessarily
          built on a science-and-engineering paradigm or exclusively grounded in existing humanities
          infrastructure. It is argued that we need to maintain a critical stance while
          simultaneously engaging in the exploration of research issues and technologies. There is
          often a gap between the material details of infrastructure and underlying, foundational
          ideas, and it is suggested that a model based on conceptual cyberinfrastructure and design
          parameters can be one way of connecting the ideational level with actual implementation.
          HUMlab at Umeå University serves as a case study.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Whether or not <em class="term">digital humanities</em> is a field can be disputed, but there can be no
          doubt that there is currently a great deal of activity, engagement, investment and
          expressed hope in the intersection of the humanities and the digital. This is the third
          article in a four-part series attempting to explore this very intersection, and it
          examines infrastructure for the humanities in relation to the current discourse of
          research infrastructure (or cyberinfrastructure) and the digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">In this article, I argue that the humanities need to consider the multiple opportunities
          associated with cyberinfrastructure, while maintaining epistemic integrity and avoiding
          modeling new infrastructure uncritically after existing models. For example, what is
          humanities cyberinfrastructure? How can we critically engage with the discourse and ideas
          of cyberinfrastructure? What are the infrastructural needs of the humanities? How can new
          infrastructure and digital humanities spaces be designed and implemented? The humanities
          are arguably in a position to co-create and co-construct their own notion of
          cyberinfrastructure, as well as implementing it, even if the discourse and its associated
          implementations do not necessarily conform fully to a science and engineering based model
          or previous layers of scholarly infrastructure. HUMlab, a digital humanities center at
          Umeå University, serves as a case study leading to a more general discussion of design
          principles and conceptual cyberinfrastructure for the humanities. Further, tentative
          advice as to implementing and strategizing humanities cyberinfrastructure is offered.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The article series, as a whole, traces digital humanities as a project in terms of
          history, epistemic commitments, modes of engagement with the digital, conceptual
          foundations for associated cyberinfrastructure, visions and hope invested, and future
          directions for the field, and necessarily, for the humanities at large.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In the first article, I examined the discursive transition from humanities computing to
          digital humanities, exploring how this naming is related to shifts in institutional,
          disciplinary, and social organization. I also addressed the epistemic culture and
          commitments of humanities computing, and tensions between this tradition and a broad
          notion of digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In the second article, I explored the broader landscape of the digital humanities through
          a discussion of digital humanities and digital humanists, associated traditions, personal
          encounters and importantly, through a suggested set of paradigmatic modes of engagement
          between the humanities and information technology: information technology as a tool, an
          object of study, an exploratory laboratory, an expressive medium, and as an activist
          venue.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">In the fourth article, I explore the multiple ways in which the digital humanities have
          been envisioned and how the digital humanities can often become a laboratory and vehicle
          for thinking about the state and future of the humanities at large. Some foundational
          issues, including the role of the humanities and changing knowledge production systems,
          are discussed and related to the development of the digital humanities. Furthermore, a
          tentative vision of the digital humanities is presented. This vision is grounded in the
          article series as a whole as well as in the important collaborative possibilities and
          challenges that lie ahead of us.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Outline</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The current article is divided into three parts. The first part discusses the notion and
          discourse of research infrastructure critically, and relates this to the humanities and
          humanities infrastructure. There is a significant gap between the grand visions of the
          discourse of cyberinfrastructure and the actual, implemented infrastructure. It is argued
          that it is essential that the humanities embrace current opportunities and explore
          multiple visions when considering cyberinfrastructure for the humanities, while avoiding
          the dangers of being uncritically modeled after existing humanities infrastructures or
          after technology and science based models. The second part investigates a particular
          example of digital humanities infrastructure in considerable detail. An attempt at
          bridging the gap mentioned above is made through introducing a three-layered model which
          incorporates conceptual cyberinfrastructure (underlying ideas and epistemic grounding),
          design principles (intermediate level articulation of conceptual cyberinfrastructure) and
          actual cyberinfrastructure (implemented infrastructure). Special emphasis is given to
          space, infrastructure and how ideational grounding and physical (as well as digital)
          implementation are negotiated. Finally, the third part of this article reflects on
          packaging, strategizing and implementing cyberinfrastructure for the humanities. This
          discussion draws on the previous parts, as well as experience from building a lab and
          engaging with the digital humanities community.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">It is argued that this expansive approach can help provide a comprehensive picture of
          research infrastructure from visionary discourse to actual implementation, and support a
          sophisticated argument for humanities cyberinfrastructure. However, any analysis of such a
          complex matter as research infrastructure is necessarily partial, and while much of the
          study is fairly general, the case study has provided an important point of canalization.
          This also means that the idea of a physical, digitally inflected laboratory has influenced
          the work, and that some other aspects, including standardization and digital libraries,
          are given limited attention.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Part I: Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities</h1><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Introduction</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Research infrastructure, while traditionally not associated with the humanities, has
            become a topic of conversation on faculty boards and among researchers in the
            humanities. Moreover, there is substantial interest from funding agencies, councils and
            various organizations under rubrics such as cyberinfrastructure and e-science. At this
            point in time, there is a grapple for securing funding, defining key questions and
            aligning the humanities with an epistemic framework bearing a strong science and
            engineering legacy. There is no doubt there are many opportunities, particularly for a
            field such as the digital humanities, but also real risks and important considerations.
            What requires attention is not least the assumed epistemic and ontological neutrality of
            the ‘infrastructure move’ and, correspondingly, its assumed broad applicability for
            everything from geology to cultural studies. In this section, we will consider risks
            associated with modeling humanities cyberinfrastructure on existing infrastructure, or
            on a technology and science driven paradigm. The stakes are high, and the
            cyberinfrastructure movement as a whole – and its articulation as an important strategy
            in the humanities – can be seen as an epistemic power play. It is a power play with very
            real implications for the humanities and the digital humanities.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Research Infrastructure</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">In the <cite class="title italic">European Roadmap for Research Infrastructures Report
              2006</cite>, research infrastructures are defined as follows: <blockquote><p>In the roadmap, we deal with facilities, resources or services of a
                unique nature that have been identified by pan-European research communities to
                conduct top-level activities in all fields. This definition of Research
                Infrastructures, including the associated human resources, covers major equipment or
                sets of instruments, as well as knowledge‑containing resources such as collections,
                archives and databases. Research Infrastructures may be <em class="term">single-sited,</em><em class="term">distributed,</em> or <em class="term">virtual</em> (the service being provided electronically).
                They often require structured information systems related to data management,
                enabling information and communication. These include technology-based
                infrastructures such as grid, computing, software and middleware. [<a class="ref" href="#europeanroadmap2006">European Roadmap 2006</a>, 16]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">This definition is fairly typical, and the full report is typical in the sense of
            providing enumerations of different types of technologies and research infrastructures.
            There is no simple way of defining <em class="term">research infrastructure(s)</em> or
              <em class="term">cyberinfrastructure</em> as the terms are part of a social, institutional and
            political context. Indeed, if we look at the term <em class="term">infrastructure</em> itself, it
            broadly refers to "the resources (as personnel, buildings, or
              equipment) required for an activity" as well as "the
                underlying foundation or basic framework (of a system or organization)" [<a class="ref" href="#merriam2010">Merriam-Webster 2010</a>]. [<a class="ref" href="#edwards2009">Edwards et al. 2009</a>, 365] state that
            the term often "connotes big, durable, well-functioning systems and
              services, from railroads and highways to telephone, electric power, and the
              Internet."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">In practice, the notion of research infrastructure carries with it a number of
            assumptions that are partly linked to funding structures and the idea of infrastructure
            as a resource of national or international interest. Research infrastructure is
            typically taken to be advanced, costly, require national or pan-national funding, be
            associated with leading research and researchers, be part of a system, have use beyond
            single research groups or disciplines, have longevity, and add significant new research
            possibilities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">In general, much discussion of cyberinfrastructure is technology-driven, data-driven
            and structural-level. This is partly a result of the selling of a new generation of
            research infrastructure (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>]), and partly a result of the
            emphasis on the traditional infrastructural needs of science and technology. Just like
            with <em class="term">digital humanities</em>, the relatively high level of abstraction of a term
            such as <em class="term">cyberinfrastructure</em> allows for descriptions not grounded in
            specific disciplines as much as in a set of high-level epistemic and technological
            commitments:</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">OCI supports cyberinfrastructure resources, tools and related
              services such as supercomputers, high-capacity mass-storage systems, system software
              suites and programming environments, scalable interactive visualization tools,
              productivity software libraries and tools, large-scale data repositories and digitized
              secientific data management systems, networks of various reach and granularity and an
              array of software tools and services that hide the complexities and heterogeneity of
              contemporary cyberinfrastructure while seeking to provide ubiquitous access and
              enhanced usability. [<a class="ref" href="#nsf2010">NSF2010</a>]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">As Borgman observes, cyberinfrastructure is often defined through example, typically
            emphasizing the "integrative, collaborative, and distributed
                nature of new forms of research" [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>, 22–23]. In addition, there is frequently an
            assumption of very large and complex data sets. While we do not necessarily need to
            question these assertions, it is important to note that we are concerned with a
            particular type of discourse and epistemic framework. This implies that a possible
            humanities alignment with cyberinfrastructure in this sense is, in fact, also an
            alignment with this discourse and with associated assumptions. For instance,
            distributedness in the sense of optiputers or grid computing is far more likely to be
            seen as cyberinfrastructure than multi-modal communication, data exchange and analysis
            through small-scale qualitative data bases, twitter and on-screen virtual worlds.
            Another assumption is that cyberinfrastructure is quite costly. This is not to say that
            humanities based cyberinfrastructure may not be quite costly, but rather to suggest that
            the structure, epistemics and cost structure of humanities based cyberinfrastructure may
            be different than that of science and engineering based infrastructure. These
            assumptions are real in the sense that they influence the way humanities research
            infrastructure is being imagined and built.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">Research infrastructure seems to easily acquire a status and life beyond <em class="emph">only</em>
            supporting or facilitating research. Importantly, research infrastructure is not
            research (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2010a">Rockwell 2010</a>]), and it seems appropriate that research
            needs and challenges shape the establishment of new infrastructure. In the case of the
            humanities, we are thus primarily concerned with research challenges and infrastructural
            needs identified by the humanities, and in particular, humanities researchers. A few
            possible examples include: embodiment in digital environments, transformation of urban
            spaces through media technology, tracing narrative structures in computer games, the use
            of map based visualization to find patterns in large sets of archival information, text
            mining technologies for literary and linguistic analysis, and understanding reading
            comprehension with the help of eye tracking equipment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">However, the nature of infrastructure and funding mechanisms make the process more
            complicated than matching one identified research challenge with an appropriate piece of
            infrastructure. In practice, infrastructure often has to be relatively abstractly framed
            and typically serve more than one specific need in order to qualify as infrastructure.
            Technologies such as visualization and grid computing fulfill this requirement, and they
            often come across as <em class="term">black boxes</em> rather than sites of situated research
            facilitation. Furthermore, funding is much more likely if the infrastructure is
            associated with ‘new’ research and major projected advances. There is also a push for
            interdisciplinary research endeavors. This means that there is a visionary,
            cross-sectional and experimental component to many infrastructural projects.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Research Infrastructure for the Humanities</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">The discourse and practice of research infrastructure are strongly situated in science
            and engineering, and typically concerns technology and systems that require national or
            pan-national funding. Examples include high performance computing, grid computing, and
            facilities for synchrotron radiation and biomedical imaging. Also in cases when national
            funding sources in principle are open to all areas of research (including the
            humanities), there is a strong tendency to mainly fund science, engineering and medical
            research. For instance, the Swedish Research Council gave out 40 infrastructural grants
            in 2009 for equipment, running costs for infrastructure and large databases, and none of
            these grants had an obvious humanities focus or humanities based principal investigator,
            although one or two grants were given to quantitative social science projects. Clearly,
            the humanities have not been seen as a significant player in this kind of funding
            schemes apart from in certain areas (e.g. computational linguistics, environmental
            archaeology and digital libraries), which also means that the specifics of humanities
            infrastructures are rarely elaborated on, and there is relatively little discussion of
            what humanities infrastructure in this sense could actually be.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">As was noted above, there is an acknowledgement and push for the importance of better
            and more research infrastructure for the humanities — not least in the digital
            humanities. This process is strongly linked to a realization that material, tools and
            culture are becoming increasingly digitalized, and that academic work is increasingly
            being carried out in a distributed and digitally supported fashion. The background is
            also a relatively recent move towards a <em class="emph">new</em> generation of research infrastructure
            often called cyberinfrastructure (in the US), e-science (in Europe and Australia) or
            simply research infrastructure (e.g. Canada), which draws on computational resources,
            distributed work and a more inclusive notion of infrastructure. [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2010a">Rockwell 2010</a>] describes this movement as an "infrastructure turn," while funding agency reports and other sources often
            describe it as a revolution (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#green2007">Green 2007</a>]). At least in terms of how
            it is presented, infrastructure in this sense is more likely to include human resources
            and other non-technical aspects than earlier generations of infrastructure.
            Nevertheless, the whole movement is essentially a science and engineering driven
            enterprise: <blockquote><p>The Panel’s overarching finding is that a new age
                has dawned in scientific and engineering research, pushed by continuing progress in

            imposed on the Humanities (sometimes by humanists themselves) without careful discussion
            of the premises and consequences. Third, there is a risk that infrastructural needs or
            agendas compatible with the largely science based model will be the ones most likely to

            cyberinfrastructure and e-science for the humanities present an opportunity to think
            carefully about what the humanities need and may not need in terms of infrastructure
            (broadly interpreted). This cannot be done, however, if we cannot maintain a critical
            stance and advocate a truly humanities based approach to academic infrastructure. At the
            same time, we need to acknowledge that we do not necessarily know what kind of
            infrastructure we need and will need, and that it is important to simultaneously engage
            in the exploration of humanities based research issues and challenges, and in the
            exploration of technology and different kinds of infrastructure (including
            infrastructure that is part of science and engineering cyberinfrastructure).
            Consequently, we must allow for both technology and humanities induced visions and
            implementations in different kinds of combinations.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Furthermore, we have to be aware of the fact that any investment in cyberinfrastructure
            is likely to be a prioritization and that certain parts of the humanities are more
            likely than others to be good candidates for such investments. It is important, however,
            that this prioritization is not a direct consequence or transfer of a predominantly
            science and engineering model of cyberinfrastructure and that it is not uncritically
            based on existing infrastructural traditions. Importantly, cyberinfrastructure is not
            neutral. In the following, we will look at three models for humanities research
            infrastructure, which exemplify the non-neutrality of cyberinfrastructure: existing
            infrastructure as a model, the humanities having no or little infrastructure, and a
            technology and science driven model.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Existing infrastructure as a model</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">The humanities have made use of research infrastructure in scholarly practice from
            early on, and for instance, libraries and archives are often pointed out as essential
            infrastructure to the humanities. Indeed, some writers claim that the humanities
            themselves make up vital infrastructure (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#src2007">Swedish Research Council 2007</a>], 2009-2012), or
            cultural infrastructure can function as trading zones between technological, artistic,
            and humanities practitioners (see [<a class="ref" href="#turner2009">Turner 2009</a>] on Burning Man as a
            cultural infrastructure). A related model is that of network forums as emergent
            structures that blend cultural and infrastructural networks (see [<a class="ref" href="#turner2005">Turner 2005</a>] on the WELL).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">One descriptive model states that there is considerable humanities research
            infrastructure already in place and that this infrastructure is a very good candidate
            for becoming cyberinfrastructure or being digitalized: <blockquote><p>The
                infrastructure of scholarship was built over centuries. It includes diverse
                collections of primary sources in libraries, archives, and museums; the
                bibliographies, searching aids, citation systems, and concordances that make that
                information retrievable; the standards that are embodied in cataloging and
                classification systems; the journals and university presses that distribute the
                information; and the editors, librarians, archivists, and curators who link the
                operation of this structure to the scholars who use it. All of these elements have
                extensions or analogues in cyberinfrastructure, at least in the cyberinfrastructure
                that is required for humanities and social sciences. [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2006">Unsworth et al. 2006</a>, 6]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">While this is probably a valid description of existing infrastructure (but cf. [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2010a">Rockwell 2010</a>]), it largely leaves out infrastructures outside of
            libraries, archives, museums and publication systems. It could be argued that we are
            concerned here with a library and collection based model – admittedly well in line with
            a large part of the humanities. It is important to realize, however, that there is a set
            of epistemic commitments associated with this model – pertaining to structure, delivery,
            material types, retrieval systems, selection procedures, relation between researchers
            and library institution and other issues basic to the humanities – and that any major
            new investment in cyberinfrastructure should not uncritically be based on such, existing
            structures and descriptions. For instance, it would seem that the model presented above
            makes a fairly strong delineation between the collections (institutions, distribution
            systems, professional functions involved, etc.) and the researchers and the research
            community. Drucker addresses such delineations critically: <blockquote><p>The
                design of new environments for performing scholarly work cannot be left to the
                technical staff and to library professionals. The library is a crucial partner in
                planning and envisioning the future of preserving, using, even creating scholarly
                resources. So are the technology professionals. But in an analogy with building
                construction, they are the architect and contractor. The creation of archives,
                analytic tools, statistical analyses of aggregate data in humanities and social
                sciences is work only possible with the combined expertise of technical,
                professional, and scholarly personnel. [...] Modelling scholarship is an
                intellectual challenge, not a technical one. I cannot say this strongly or clearly
                enough. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#drucker2009a">#drucker2009a</a></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">In contrast to much of the discourse of cyberinfrastructure and digital humanities,
            Drucker focuses on the scholarly challenge and not on the technology or

            reinforces specific roles, and the term <em class="term">contractors</em> may be seen to mark an
            implicit class distinction and clear institutional positions. A related question is
            whether new institutional roles will develop, and whether these will blur the roles
            described by Drucker and the ACLS report. Along these lines, Blackwell and Crane call
            for institutional change: <blockquote><p>[…] [W]e need new institutions to
                provide access to the results of our work. Neither the libraries nor the publishers
                of the early twenty-first century serve the needs that emerge in this collection.
                While libraries may survive and indeed flourish as an institution, they will do so
                by subsuming and transforming the functions that we entrusted to publishers in print

            infrastructure and, at the same time, a partial realization that that the needs may be
            changing. This is an argument sometimes put forward by the digital humanities community:
                <blockquote><p>Despite a slow and uneven uptake of digital technology in
                some areas of the Arts and Humanities research, the discipline is no longer based on
                pen and paper. Specific individual needs of research that relies on the use of
                advanced technologies must be better understood and matched by a level of support
                that is already enjoyed by the scientists. [<a class="ref" href="#bentkowska2007">Bentkowska-Kafel 2007</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">This kind of reasoning to some extent reinforces the sense of "basic" humanities
            being mainly reliant on technologies such as pen and paper, and it is by no means a new
            argument (see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#roper1991">Roper 1991</a>, 131]). More broadly, however, the
            view of basic humanities as without, or little, significant infrastructure not only
            assumes a science and technology based idea of what makes up infrastructure, but also
            imposes a "pen and paper" construction of the humanities. Pen and paper, while
            inherently communicative and collaborative, are also linked to the assumption that
            humanities scholarship to a large extent is a solitary endeavor (the individual scholar
            in his or her study): <blockquote><p>Humanities scholars often work alone
                without collaborators or assistants. In contrast to the cooperative efforts common
                in the sciences and social sciences, humanities scholarship is the result of
                solitary research and thought. [<a class="ref" href="#burnette1994">Burnette et al. 1994</a>, 182]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">Obviously most humanities research is not at all solitary (cf.

            person. Moreover, there can be no doubt that there is research infrastructure in the
            humanities and that it has a long history. One possible consequence of construing the
            humanities as not having much infrastructure and being a solitary enterprise is a higher
            readiness to adopt science and engineering models of cyberinfrastructure (as if there is
              "nothing" there to start with).</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">A Technology- and Science-driven Model</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">When a science and engineering framework is taken to the humanities and social
            sciences, there will often be attempts at aligning specific toolsets and technologies
            with the subject areas in question and here, the starting point will often be the
            technology. A fairly recent example is grid computing (see e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#bonnett2008">Bonnett, Rockwell and Kuchmey 2008</a>]). Questions asked may be: What can grid computing do for the
            humanities? What large humanities data sets are particularly suitable for grid computing
            applications? The gap between high performance computing perspectives on grid computing
            and humanities based research issues and questions can be very large, and in
            facilitating meetings between the two, it is critical to create a common discursive
            space and allow time for dialogue. A good example of deep thinking about this process is
            provided by the report "Mind the Gap"[<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2010b">Rockwell &amp; Meredith-Lobay 2010</a>], in which it is argued that currently, the main gap

            culture and support. <blockquote><p>On the one hand we have to find ways of
                training and preparing humanities research teams to be able to imagine using

            not trivial. Importantly, we also need to acknowledge that "technological
              competence" can be very diverse, research intensive and complex. Indeed, since the
            discourse of cyberinfrastructure has a tendency to take place at an aggregate level in
            relation to complex and internally diverse entities such as the humanities or science

                scholars and social scientists will require similar facilities but, obviously, not
                exactly the same ones: “grids of computational centers” are needed in the humanities
                and social sciences, but they will have to be staffed with different kinds of
                subject-area experts; comprehensive and well-curated libraries of digital objects
                will certainly be needed, but the objects themselves will be different from those
                used in the sciences; software toolkits for projects involving data-mining and
                data-visualization could be shared across the sciences, humanities, and social
                sciences, but only up to the point where the nature of the data begins to shape the
                nature of the tools. Science and engineering have made great strides in using
                information technology to understand and shape the world around us. This report is
                focused on how these same technologies could help advance the study and

            tools". It may be argued that this point occurs very early and that there is more
            at play here than the nature of the data. It could be argued the alignment described in
            the ACLS report is simply not feasible. As Sterne points out, "disciplines never fully constitute their objects; they fight over them" [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2005">Sterne 2005</a>, 251]. He argues that these fights are partly
            what make disciplines maintain their intellectual vibrancy. If the range of data and the
            study objects are in question, it may be difficult to <em class="emph">process</em> data up to a
            certain point and use generic tools without early involvement from researchers.
            Furthermore, it could be argued any data would already be part of an information and
            knowledge infrastructure that is relevant to knowledge production and creation of tools
            and technology: <blockquote><p>Information infrastructures such as databases
                should be read both discursively and materially; they are a site of political and

            cyberinfrastructure for the humanities have strong implications. What happens if we do

            double-binds (following [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2006">Ratto 2006</a>]) where humanities researchers who

            broadly. Ratto's principal example concerns use of computer-supported visualization and
            modeling in classical archaeology, and how three groups of scholars and scientists — for
            different reasons grounded in different epistemic commitments — rejected a project where
            an immersive 3D environment was used to question traditional understanding of the use of

            and undetailed. At times, it is also positivistic and seemingly unsituated. At close
            quarters, on the other hand, infrastructure is often very concrete and material. The
            step from this material quality, as exemplified by a strand of optical fiber or a
            database server, to the conceptual underpinnings of research infrastructure, e.g. the
            ideas underlying a digital humanities initiative can be very substantial. In the
            following section, it is suggested that it can be helpful to look at the underlying
            ideas and the material qualities as well as intermediate level design principles that
            mediate ideas and infrastructure.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">In order to connect ideational grounding, design principles and actual implemented
            infrastructure, the case study of HUMlab, a digital humanities laboratory in the North
            of Sweden, will be examined in detail, as a particular example of humanities
            cyberinfrastructure. The case study was partly chosen because of the current author’s
            intimate knowledge of it, but also because it serves as a fairly distinct example of
            digital humanities infrastructure. Needless to say, it is only one example of
            infrastructural implementations, and as most infrastructures, highly situated in a
            particular context.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Framing the Case Study</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">HUMlab is situated in a comprehensive research university, Umeå University, and as a
            ten-year endeavor, it has just undergone a major expansion supported strongly by the
            university as well as several external funding agencies. HUMlab has a commitment to a
            wide range of different modes of engagement which, naturally, affects infrastructural
            needs and visions. At this particular point in time, the university has taken a decision
            to build a new artistic campus — Umeå Arts Campus — by the river not too far from the
            main campus. Here the Institute of Design, the Academy of Fine Arts, BildMuseet (museum
            for contemporary visual arts) and a new School of Architecture will be situated, in
            addition to the new HUMlab-X. HUMlab will be the only institute or department to have a
            clear presence on both campuses.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">As noted above, there is evidently a considerable gap between the visionary, often
            positivistic and unsituated, discourse on cyberinfrastructure and implemented, and often
            quite material and situated, infrastructure. The connection between the two seems weak
            at times, and as we have seen, the conceptual underpinnings of cyberinfrastructure and
            associated epistemic scope may not be clear or explicated. At the same time, seemingly
            small decisions about technical or constructional details can have a very real impact on
            potential use and research possibilities afforded by the infrastructure. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">Through looking at implemented infrastructure, how it came about, ideational grounding
            and actual use, we can get a better sense of the complexity of the process and hopefully
            suggest a model that makes the concept of cyberinfrastructure richer, at the same time
            as linking to actual infrastructure. In the following, a model which includes conceptual
            cyberinfrastructure, design principles and actual cyberinfrastructure will be explored
            in relation to a particular infrastructural example.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">There are many possible infrastructural needs for a digital humanities lab or any
            digital humanities enterprise. These needs are partly connected to the modes of
            engagement discussed in the second article in this series [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2010">Svensson 2010</a>].
            For example, if the primary mode of engagement is technology as tool, you are likely to
            have rather different needs from an enterprise where the digital as a study object is
            the main focus. Patently, there are a great many different possible implementations for
            any digital humanities related enterprise dependent on factors such as the specific
            context, visions and epistemic scope. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">It is worth stressing the wide range of possible implementations within a single mode
            of engagement such as technology as tool. One example may be a research environment
            interested in experimental work using eye-tracking equipment or phonetic experiments in
            an echo-free room. These various facilities could possibly be manifested in several
            separate (but probably co-localized) rooms. Another example could be an institution
            focused on digital cultural heritage and the use of heavy-duty databases for making
            cultural heritage accessible to researchers around the world. Here the database servers
            would not necessarily have to take up any lab space at all as they would probably be
            housed in a server hall somewhere. Much of the work could then be carried out in
            individual offices or in a small lab space with workstations and space to help
            facilitate collaborative projects. A third example may be found in the tool-building
            phase of a large-scale research project where the digital component was a small part of
            the whole project. Here the facilities and equipment used may be part of that larger
            research project, or there might be some general resources for certain tasks.
            Importantly, all of the above examples require resources beyond the technology proper,
            and high-level competency is often needed. For instance, it does not make much sense to
            invest in high-end eye-tracking equipment if you do not have staff or researchers
            invested in methodology, technical management and maintenance. For more extensive use,
            and higher return on investment (i.e. higher and more "efficient" use), it is
            unsurprisingly advantageous to have dedicated people and resources connected to the
            infrastructure.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">The installation we will now look at has a more general, multipurpose character beyond
            the needs of single research groups, disciplines or methodological areas. HUMlab is a
            physically grounded studio environment heavily dependent on distributed work,
            international collaboration and reaching out. My knowledge from this institution comes
            from personal engagement and directorship, and while this inside perspective certainly
            calls for methodological concern and care, it also brings long experience from building,
            developing and incorporating a particular institution and its associated
            cyberinfrastructure.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Introducing HUMlab</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">HUMlab at Umeå University, Sweden, is a digital humanities center whose main physical
            manifestation is a 500 m<span class="hi superscript">2</span> (5,500 square feet) studio space
            at the center of the campus below the university library. This location is ideal because
            of its centrality and because it is seen as a neutral space not associated with any
            particular school or department. It is also a space with history and certain, irregular
            physical qualities that seem to help create an engaging and attractive environment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">The basic idea behind HUMlab, as articulated early on, is to facilitate the meeting
            between humanities, culture and information technology, or put differently, to be a
            meeting place for the humanities, culture and information technology. Being a
            collaborative and intersectional <em class="emph">place</em> is critical to the operation. This
            fairly simple idea makes up a strong ideational basis, which is evident in the lab’s
            documentation from the very beginning up to this point. At the same time, it is not very
            concrete in the sense of detailing out implementations and constraints. This has allowed
            a fairly dynamic development and a relative openness to ideas and initiatives.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53">The roots of this fairly independent role can partly be found in the lab’s origins.
            HUMlab was established in the late 1990s as a result of a discussion at the humanities
            faculty that started around 1994-95. The earliest incitement was the fact that the
            analogue language laboratory (mainly for teaching language pronunciation and
            proficiency) was gradually breaking down, and an early response was to try to devise
            some kind of multimedia lab. The resultant application for external funding was not
            successful, but had it been, the new lab would probably have been fairly traditional and
            instrumental. The failed attempt to secure funding led to the faculty seeking help
            elsewhere, resulting in a multiple-year process and ultimately to a very different
            concept. This concept, the meeting place mentioned above, partly came from outside the
            faculty and through working with a senior and creative officer at the university-wide IT
            function, the faculty secured technological validity, administrative know-how and an
            outside perspective on the humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p54">The resultant project application rendered some early external funding for equipment in
            1998, and a decision was taken to support the lab at a faculty board meeting in November
            1998. It is noteworthy that the faculty board, despite the secured external funding for
            equipment and a fairly long internal process, was quite divided. The decision was
            positive but it took the decisive vote of the chair of the board to settle the matter.
            This hesitancy is possibly unsurprising, giving the "newness" of the enterprise and
            that any decision of funding is implicitly or explicitly a matter of prioritization.
            Also, investments in infrastructure or continuously paying for maintaining an
            infrastructure outside the traditional commitment of a faculty brings up important
            questions about long-term costs and the extent of financial and institutional
            commitments.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">The Space</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55">The idea of having a lab or studio space was part of the concept from very early on.
            Indeed, as we noted above, it all started as a concern with an old language laboratory
            and a possible multimedia replacement, the spatial need and having a lab could be seen
            as part of the original epistemic setup. It was taken further, though, in the subsequent
            discussions of HUMlab. There is a significant difference between a more moderate lab
            space and the large space that was envisioned and later allocated for HUMlab. This may
            partly have been a consequence of the focus on HUMlab as a meeting place and a diverse
            studio space with many different technologies and approaches. Moreover, HUMlab was
            described at an early stage as a <em class="term">playground</em> - a place for exploring, testing
            ideas, connecting with outside initiatives and materials, and playing with technology -
            and this may have added to the sense of needing substantial space.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p56">The characteristics of the available space played an important role. After some
            negotiation, HUMlab was offered an old space below the university library. For many
            years, the long-term goal, supported by the university management, was to secure another
            space (newly built), but it has gradually become more and more obvious how well the
            existing space works. The location is critical, and a new, nice space at the periphery
            of the campus would most certainly not work as well as a meeting place. Also, the
            quirkiness, character and history of an old space plays an important role, as
            exemplified by the pillars, the irregularity of the space, the basement position and its
            earlier function as an exam hall. We will return to these elements shortly.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p57">57</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p57">HUMlab as a physical playground and meeting place is very much grounded in ongoing
            activities, lab life, meetings and technology. This physical presence extends into
            various digital environments and the two spaces of activity are richly interlinked. Most
            of the activities and projects are distributed in one sense or another. For instance,
            one of the first projects in the lab (started in 1999) a three-year student based
            exploration and expression in a virtual world hosted by HUMlab [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2003">Svensson 2003</a>], and since then, there has been lively engagement with a
            range of virtual world platforms. Most of the projects to do with digital cultural
            heritage have a presence in the physical lab, but much of the core operation occurs in
            relation to distributed databases and tools in international teams. Another example of
            merging of physical and digital is a fairly recent interest in physical computing. One
            of the 2008-2009 digital art fellows ran an operation called Ms. Balthazar’s Laboratory,
            a physical computing workshop for artistic uses intended primarily for women, with
            continuous meetings in HUMlab. The collaboration and workshops continue after the
            digital art fellow has left Umeå. Another fellow facilitated a process of community
            creation and curation that led to the exhibition of the Open Source Embroidery Project
            in 2009 in HUMlab and the BildMuseet. This exhibition opened in San Francisco in the
            winter of 2009, and it also reverberates in the lab through new courses and other
            activities.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Organization and Collaboration</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">In terms of organization, HUMlab is a unit directly under the Humanities faculty and in
            most respects structurally comparable to a department. HUMlab can employ faculty as well
            as staff, and the director of the lab has roughly the same role as a head of a
            department. There is no formal research discipline associated with HUMlab, which means
            that Ph.D. students are affiliated both with HUMlab and a department. Faculty can be
            employed and tenured (in the European sense) by HUMlab. There are many possible
            organizational models, of course, but in many respects this particular organizational
            position seems advantageous. For one thing, there is little risk that HUMlab becomes too
            much associated with one department. HUMlab works with all humanities departments and
            disciplines (but in different ways and to varying extents). A higher organizational
            position such as a being a university level unit may be useful in some respects, but the
            risk may be that you lose disciplinary anchorage. Furthermore, because of the unit’s
            relative independency and multiple modes of engagement with information technology,
            there is little risk that HUMlab becomes classified as a service unit (a kind of unit
            normally prone to restructuring and financial rationalization; cf. [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2002">Flanders &amp; Unsworth 2002</a>]).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p59">59</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p59">An important part of HUMlab as practice is broad collaboration within and outside the
            humanities faculty. It is vital that HUMlab has had (or taken) a mandate to work
            extensively with other parts of the university, artists, companies and others interested
            in collaboration. Often these collaborations function as a way of creating collaborative
            opportunities for humanities researchers, students and departments. Importantly, HUMlab
            presents itself as being dynamically built on such collaborations rather than as a
            distinct and self-sustained research center. This is probably one of the reasons why
            there is strong support for a new HUMlab on the new Umeå Arts Campus. There was clearly
            an interest in having parties who not only engage in collaboration, but whose main
            function is to facilitate collaboration and interdisciplinary meetings (and in a way are
            dependent on rich collaboration for success).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p60">60</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p60">It may be argued that a chief difficulty in growing digital humanities is finding modes
            of scholarship that enable young researchers to inhabit the often problematic in-between
            zones. HUMlab attempts to balance interdisciplinarity within a collaborative zone with a
            grounding in departments and disciplines. This allows a range of strategies to grow.
            Further, it provides migration in discourses between interdisciplinary zones and centers
            of traditional academic departments and enables solidarities to arise in communities
            across departments, thus helping structure a field of research, and does not force young
            scholars to compromise between conservative choices for career and their interest in
            speaking to the contemporary moment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">An early strategic decision that shaped HUMlab and associated cyberinfrastructure is
            that access is not restricted to specific groups and that the lab is open to students,
            faculty and staff as well as outside participants (a consequence of the basic idea of
            meeting place). Hence there is no exclusive focus on research, rather a continuous
            cross-fertilization between education, research and development work. HUMlab was
            designed to allow several simultaneous activities, and normally, a single activity
            cannot monopolize the lab. For instance, this means that a teacher using HUMlab for a
            class cannot ask other people to leave the lab (unless they are obviously disturbing the
            teaching), and that interaction between groups and individuals is encouraged. The
            difference between a regular classroom and HUMlab is quite pronounced, while some
            teachers may initially be uncomfortable with HUMlab as learning environment, most seem
            to appreciate the dynamics and energy of the lab. A common reaction if you enter the lab
            for the first time – not least students – is one of (positive) surprise and some
            bewilderment.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">The Importance of Spatial Configuration and Designing Space</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">The interrelation between the space, technology and design is key to the actual
            implementation of a digital humanities environment whether it be physical or digital.
            Space and design cannot be divorced from technology and intellectual milieu (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#livingstone2003">Livingstone 2003</a>]); they are indeed important parts of what makes up
            cyberinfrastructure.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">The physical lab space of HUMlab was originally an examination hall and is situated in
            the oldest part of the university – below the university library and the central
            rotunda. The basement location gives the lab a certain atmosphere (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#williams2008">Williams 2008</a>]), which is reinforced by approaching the lab though a tunnel
            of protruding pipes, cement walls, sounds from the pipes, echoes in the corridor and

            subterranean feel, with some of the edginess and rawness associated with the
              "underground," and the "warm" inside design of the lab.</div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000090/...000090/resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000090/...000090/resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>Photo of HUMlab (original lab space)</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p64">The foundational function is further evidenced through 24 pillars and the rotunda,
            whose protruding base forms one of the inner walls. The ceiling height is not the same
            throughout the space and in general, the space is fairly irregular. The original lab
            space is about 280 m<span class="hi superscript">2</span> (3000 square feet). It contains a
            closeable inner space with large windows and the lab’s computer workstations are mainly
            organized around pillars (as "islands"). Together with the aforementioned glass
            room, a meeting section behind a bookcase and an area with couches and an aquarium, the
            islands make up an important part of the lab space. There are quite a few screens in the
            space, mostly private workstation screens, but also several display screens. Many of the
            private screens are in fact fairly public as the space has been designed to encourage
            people to relate to each other’s work. In this way, there is a simultaneous production
            of a shared sense of publicness, co-location and semi-private space (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#mccarthy2001">McCarthy 2001</a>]). Other screens consistently work as portals to projects and
            other physical and digital spaces.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">Although a rather untraditional lab environment, the old part of the space has some
            elements associated with traditional computer lab spaces, including the computer
            workstations described above. When HUMlab was expanded in 2008 with an additional 220
              m<span class="hi superscript">2</span> (2400 square feet), the new space was designed with
            considerably more flexibility than the old part. In a way, the two parts represent
            fairly different implementations and concepts within a common framework. The function of
            an open meeting place is quite pronounced in the new space. At the center is "a room
              in a room" defined by wallpapered pillars, a rug and a large central table, and all
            these parts can be removed or reconfigured. The rest of the space is fairly open in its
            basic configuration. An important property of the new lab space is a screenscape that
            includes a number of public screens around the space. There are ten large flat screens
            (57"-70") and one very large, back projected high resolution (4K) screen. The large
            screen has multi-touch functionality and there is a spatial audio system which covers
            the screenscape in its entirety. The basic idea is to afford rich contextualization, and
            partly collaborative and partly distributed work in a fairly large interaction space.
            The arrangement of the screens is quite significant and their placement at the periphery
            of the space in combination with the centrally placed table prevents the screens from
            dominating the space.</div><div id="figure02" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000090/.../000090/resources/images/figure02.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000090/.../000090/resources/images/figure02.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>Photo of HUMlab (part of the screenscape and the expanded studio

            they structure and break up the space in certain ways. Participants in the space can be
            situated in relation to individual screens or in the context of the full screenscape, as
            well in ongoing activities or conversations. [<a class="ref" href="#mccarthy2001">McCarthy 2001</a>] discusses
            some of these complexities in relation to multiple overhead monitors: <blockquote><p>Serial spectacles on overhead screens both symbolically join spaces
                together in long-distance communication and fragment the social atmosphere of their
                immediate environments. The connotations of public address that come with the
                convention of overhead screen placement suture the conversing spectator into (at
                least) two places at once.  [<a class="ref" href="#mccarthy2001">McCarthy 2001</a>, 124]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p67">67</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p67">While the screens in the HUMlab screenscape are not placed in an overhead position (but

            while maintaining a sense of communication in between the more public and the more
            private zones. One of the sections behind the pillars has a combined whiteboard and
            projection screen that is not part of the screenscape and which allows a small research
            group to collaboratively and semi-privately use the screen and associated

            have direct bearing on knowledge production and the epistemic scope of such
            infrastructures, and that space, physical and digital, is often a carrier of
            cyberinfrastructure. There is rich meaning to how space and infrastructure are
            configured, juxtaposed and used far beyond the purely functional or technical properties
            of the infrastructure. The following set of quotes illustrates this point in relation to
            a traditional humanities infrastructure - the library. <blockquote><p class="ptext">I'm

                  to gather there to exchange ideas. The library is our lab. And our food trucks,

            associated with conceptual grounding (the library as idea, meeting place and hub),
            design (e.g. the big windows and the network drop), location, personal engagement with

              "packaging" required to address the challenge we outlined in Part I of this

            space and conceptual notions can be found in Reinhold Martin's analysis of corporate
            architecture in the United States after the Second World War [<a class="ref" href="#martin2005">Martin 2005</a>]. He traces how cybernetics and a systems-based theory in architecture come to create
            flexible and modular interiors. In his analysis of IBM and the IBM Rochester's plant -
            designed by architect Eero Saarinen - that opened in September 1958, Martin points to
            how the architecture of modular blue patterns was used to "displace (or dissimulate) the social hierarchies written into white collars and
                gray flannel, in the name of 'human relations' among mass-produced
                IBMers" [<a class="ref" href="#martin2005">Martin 2005</a>, 170]. One example of this is the visitors'
            entry not being seen as more important or architecturally pronounced than the entries to
            the employees' pavilions. Martin traces the parallels between the design of devices such
            as the IBM 305 Random Access Memory Accounting Machine (RAMAC, released in 1956) and the
            corporate buildings of IBM. He points to the analogy between human nervous systems and
            computer design, and associated neurological terminology made prevalent by John Neumann
            and others, and how this thinking may also become reflected also in the architecture.
                <blockquote><p>While IBM represented itself as a mere maker of business
                machines and "calculators," even its building were experimenting with
                  "logical controls" encoded into a paper-thin skin. Even more than the RAMAC,
                this building's "brain" was on its surface. In that regard, its image was
                integral to the organizational strategies that kept the company growing and enabled
                it to expand its research into artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, and
                related arenas. [<a class="ref" href="#martin2005">Martin 2005</a>, 181]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p73">73</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p73">These arrangements clearly have rich meaning, and it could be argued that such a

            the ideational grounding of a particular instance of research infrastructure. In the
            case of HUMlab, facilitating cross-sectional meetings is such an underlying idea. In the
            model presented here, these basic ideas can be related to design principles. For
            instance, the design principle of translucence (to facilitate both "see-through"
            and individual space) helps facilitate the idea of HUMlab as a meeting place. These
            principles, in turn, inform the implementation of actual infrastructure (for instance
            making extensive use of glass and not having any fully isolated parts of the lab).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p75">75</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p75">In practice the flow will be iterative, and for instance, it is rarely the case that
            new space and infrastructure can be built without any constraints imposed from existing
            systems, architecture and research infrastructure, as well as existing funding regimes
            and/or policies at the administrative level. Such constraints (and possibilities) need
            to be presented and negotiated throughout the process.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p76">76</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p76">While this model may seem ambitious for small installations and for conventionalized
            infrastructure (such as a traditional classroom intended to be used "traditionally"
            or a standard query system for a research database), it can be quite useful when
            thinking about new kind of learning and research spaces and associated infrastructure.
            It encourages us to be clear about the conceptual underpinnings and epistemic scope,
            think carefully about how these can be translated into design principles and
            operationalized in relation to existing infrastructure and planned cyberinfrastructure.
            If successful, such a process would help us articulate our requirements, visions and
            ideas in a broad, contextualized sense and in relation to conceptual issues, as well as
            physical and digital implementation. Furthermore, it may help us create a meeting point
            for people from the "enterprise" (department, university administration,
              "users") and people involved in the creation of new infrastructure and space
            (architects, hardware and software specialists, contractors, property owners and
            sometimes also funding agencies).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p77">77</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p77">Importantly, since the digital humanities maximally but not necessarily, incorporates
            many different disciplines, disciplinary pathways, modes of engagement, perspectives and
            outside pressures, it is quite important to be conscious of epistemic traditions and be
            deliberate about the process, vision and implementation. It is also important, however,
            to acknowledge that arriving at a conceptual foundation and implementation often is a
            complex, iterative and exploratory process, and that there are many possible paths.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p78">78</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p78">In the case of HUMlab, it is quite clear that there has been a set of conceptual
            underpinnings that have shaped the emerging cyberinfrastructure from the beginning,
            although some of these may not have been articulated until quite late in the process.
            Other parts of the conceptual foundation have developed and changed over the years.
            Below, three significant examples are given, one of which is discussed at more length.
            Additionally, individual design principles are detailed in the subsequent section.</div><div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item"><span class="label bold">Meeting place</span>: The notion of HUMlab as a meeting place is central
              to HUMlab as an idea and space, and clearly articulated in early vision documents as
              well as in actual implementation. This is reflected in the design principles of
              translucence (encouraging contact and having a sense of what other people are working
              on), flexibility (supporting many different kinds of meetings and technological
              platforms) and engagement (a space and endeavor that attracts engagement, intensity
              and interest), and their spatial and technological implementations. In terms of
              facilitating a variety of meetings, HUMlab has plenty of social spaces (also outside
              the lab proper), meeting tables, an "outward" design that make many computer
              screens visible to others, many large screens, coffee (often free) and a range of
              software, hardware and activities that attract people from different parts of the
              university and from the outside. Also, the lab is available to users 24 hours, all
              year. A well-functioning lab space can help create a platform for managing and
              supporting research infrastructure in that there will always be a range of
              competencies and skill sets available, and at best, a willingness to help and share
              knowledge. The sense of meeting place extends outside the physical lab space, of
              course, and there is a strong dispersed community, ongoing distributed work and shared
              data sets, materials and tool development. </li><li class="item"><span class="label bold">Multiple modes of engagement</span>: Another conceptual and epistemic
              baseline for HUMlab is the interest in multiple modes of engagement with information
              technology and the digital. This means that the lab has been set up to support work
              with technology as a tool, an object of study, an exploratory laboratory, an
              expressive medium and an activist venue. Although there was no early explicit
              commitment to these particular modes of engagement when HUMlab was started, there was
              an openness and flexibility (both in terms of technology and 'content') that allowed
              for very different kinds of projects and activities. Over the years, cumulative
              practice and reflecting on this practice - also in relation to other international
              initiatives - has resulted in a model of modes of engagement that could be said to be
              part of the conceptual cyberinfrastructure of the lab. This commitment to a range of
              different kinds of engagement has very direct implications for design and
              infrastructure. For example, a multiple-mode focus is not compatible with having a
              traditionally instrumental computer lab setup as the space needs to work for
              activities such as seminars, meetings and relating to various study objects (digital
              and non-digital). These elements are also important in relation to bringing in
              researchers and students from the disciplines - not only because familiar elements may
              be attractive, but also because they perform basic epistemic functions. As we have
              already noted, a commitment to multiple modes of engagement also calls for a varied
              technological setup, and HUMlab offers a wide range of technologies for analytical
              work, visualization, creative work, screenings and physical computing. The downside to
              this may be that it is more difficult to allocate substantial resources to single
              areas (as in a specialized lab environment). More generally, it would seem that the
              humanities often have need for a more diversified and multiplex infrastructure than
              the kind of science and engineering cyberinfrastructure described in policy and vision
              documents (cf. the discussion in Part I and the reflections presented in Part
              III).</li><li class="item"><span class="label bold">Context and digital visualization and representation</span>: A third
              conceptual foundation draws on the intersection between the humanities as providing
              rich cultural and historical context and technologies of multiplex digital
              visualization and representation. Here the primary associated design principle is
              multiplexity and the most obvious implementation would be the screenscape and
              underlying technological infrastructure. The screen and interaction space has
              different functions in relation to different projects, activities and modes of
              engagement. The actual implemented infrastructure clearly stimulates ideas,
              experiments and uses, and in this sense the infrastructure is just the beginning. Also
              the prototype design presented in various ways (e.g. a 3D model of the design, a fly
              through and as a virtual environment) before the space was implemented provoked ideas,
              but actually having the space makes the process easier, more grounded and multi-level.
              This exemplifies the iterative nature of the process and the fact that new ideas may
              develop as a partial result of having cyberinfrastructure. </li></ul></div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Humanities Representations and Screenscapes in Practice</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p79">79</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p79">In a discussion of the initiative for software studies and associated cultural
            analytics research at UC San Diego, Lev Manovich points to how having access to the
            visualization environment HIperSpace at CALIT2 has made new ideas or directions
            possible: <blockquote><p>HIperSpace is the reason why I am able to think of
                being able to map and analyze global cultural patterns in detail. I would not ever
                think about it if I just worked on my laptop screen. [<a class="ref" href="#franklin2008">Franklin &amp; Rodriguez'G 2008</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p80">80</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p80">While facilities such as HIperSpace and HUMlab are very flexible and will generate
            ideas, uses and experiments beyond what could be envisioned at the start, it is also
            true that users and uses are constrained by the way these infrastructures have been
            thought up and set up. This could be said to be part of the conceptual
            cyberinfrastructure. HIperSpace is a very large tiled display made up of many small
            screens - basically a large, rectangular screen with internal mullions (caused by the
            frames of the individual screens). It is seen as a front end to an optiputer and the
            main overarching goal is to "examine a 'future' in which
                networking is no longer a bottleneck to local, regional, national and international
                computing" [<a class="ref" href="#defanti2009">Defanti et al. 2009</a>]. The mullions are seen as something that will
            eventually get reduced and maybe disappear altogether visually - thus creating one large
            seamless display. HUMlab, on the other hand, has an investment in both allowing for big
            display walls and for a multitude of separate, visually distinct screens. The frames of
            the screens are thus quite important, as is the positioning of individual screens in the
            space. On a very large screen, such as the HIperSpace installation, you are likely to
            display a number of different materials, sources and windows, and thus the individual
            bits will be framed on the screen, but this framing is screen internal (cf. the notion
            of multiplex frames in [<a class="ref" href="#friedberg2006">Friedburg 2006</a>], and the discussion of computer
            windows in [<a class="ref" href="#manovich1995">Manovich 1995</a>]) and rather different from having separate
            screens with <em class="term">heavy</em> frames. A somewhat related paradigm for visualization is
            virtual reality (representing an earlier generation of privileged cyberinfrastructure),
            which often tries to remove the frame altogether. <blockquote><p>The visual
                (and aural and haptic) displays that immerse the user in the virtual world and that
                block out contradictory sensory impressions from the real world; [<a class="ref" href="#brooks1999">Brooks 1999</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p81">81</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p81">In some ways, the distributed screenscape of HUMlab is the opposite of such virtual

            studio and exhibition spaces, and the collaborative affordances (whether in relation to
            technology or not) are quite important. Also, as pointed out above, the screens have
            their own identity and framing. The epistemological stance is thus radically different
            from that of many virtual reality environments where you, as Dan Sandin, co-inventor of
            the CAVE, points out, "in a sense, view things from inside the
                scene" [<a class="ref" href="#russett2009">Russett 2009</a>, 183]. In other words, there is arguably no

            can include video, computer and other sources). The screenscape as a whole is part of a

            of practices and possible uses can be supported, spanning from traditional seminars

            screenscape can help philologists and art historians to display and interact with a
            number of manuscript pages or pictures. Researchers in environmental archeology can pull
            together large data sets, diverse materials and visualized data models in one space, and
            use a large, high-resolution screen to work with the data model (zooming, modifying,
            interrelating the model with data sources) locally or together with remote research
            centers. Site-specific art installations can be created in the space. Students who have
            built virtual exhibitions in Second Life can show their individual or their group’s
            slices of their virtual world on screens. Events such as an indie game evenings can make
            use of all the screens to allow people to interact with a range of games, and in an
            associated presentation, individual games can be moved to the large screen and
            juxtaposed as part of a comparative and analytical process. Other events may bring in
            remote researchers through different types of virtual environments and through
            visualized data sets. Thematic screenings of films can be facilitated in the space. An
            upcoming seminar with an international guest speaker can be contextualized through a
            curated selection of images, video clips, texts and web pages. More generally and
            visionarily, complex scholarly environments for humanistic research can bring together
            analytical tools, distributed materials, representations and ways to tackle central
            research challenges in a studio space such as in the aforementioned descriptions, as

            conceptual cyberinfrastructure associated with new part of HUMlab, we have seen that
            multiplexity and framing are critical factors. HUMlab is different from virtual reality

            at the 1959 Moscow World's Fair). In her discussion of computer screens, Friedberg seems
            to suggest a one-screen (multiplex frame) paradigm: <blockquote><p>The Windows

            cyberinfrastructure just discussed and the actual implementation. In the case of HUMlab,
            a number of central design principles have emerged in the course of the development of
            the lab. While these principles naturally are situated in a specific context, they also
            have some more general applicability.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p88">88</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p88">Design principles can be seen as a way of connecting the ideational level with material
            cyberinfrastructure, and as facilitating a means of discussing and articulating
            infrastructural projects without getting caught up only in detailed infrastructure
            and/or the abstract visions typical of the discourse on cyberinfrastructure (cf. Part
            I). The principles are seen as being anchored in both these levels. In the following, I
            will discuss a number of suggested design principles for HUMlab as an infrastructural
            project. The seven principles in question are translucence, flexibility, memory and
            context, multiplexity, non-linearity and messiness, engagement, and adaptability and
            co-evolution. While these are not all-inclusive or unchanging, they suggest an anchored
            and systemic-level foundation for HUMlab as infrastructure.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p89">89</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p89">In designing the space of HUMlab, an important design principle has been
              <em class="term">translucence</em>. The basic idea is that it is important to see what is going
            on in the lab while not resorting to having one large and totally open space. In optics,
            translucent materials allow light to pass through them diffusely. The constraints and
            affordances are not only visual, of course, and awareness of whether other people can
            hear you or not is, for instance, an important factor. In a studio (or other)
            environment, this translates to having a space which has divisions and separation which
            allow for sub spaces to maintain spatial, auditory and conceptual integrity (to
            different degrees), while also retaining a sense of what is going on in other parts of
            the space. This affects possible interactions in several ways (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#erickson2000">Erickson &amp; Kellogg 2000</a>]). On one level, you have access to concurrent activities,
            processes and dialogues. For instance, when the lab or a project is presented to a
            delegation in the inner glass room, there is a good visual sense of activities and
            people outside the room. Similarly, people outside this room have a sense of what goes
            on inside (and will for instance be prepared to act when the delegation prepares to
            leave the inner room). Dourish and Bly’s notion of awareness and their porthole system
            are based on a similar notion, although they emphasize the distributed nature of the
            system: <blockquote><p>Awareness involves knowing who is "around," what
                activities are occurring, who is talking with whom; it provides a view of one
                another in the daily work environments. Awareness may lead to informal interactions,
                spontaneous connections, and the development of shared cultures — all
                important aspects of maintaining working relationships which are denied to groups
                distributed across multiple sites. [<a class="ref" href="#dourish1992">Dourish &amp; Bly 1992.</a>, 541]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p90">90</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p90">HUMlab takes as its point of departure the organization of collaborations across
            physical-digital boundaries. For instance, seminars primarily take place in the physical
            space, but they are almost always streamed live, and sometimes there is a secondary
            screen showing remote participants interested in participating in the discussion.
            Earlier this was done through a text-based chat client, and later with video based
            software. The list of remote participants on the screen (which is visible to the
            physical participants) can support a sense of shared presence and increased awareness.
            Similarly, a tweet visualization with local and distant tweets in relation to an ongoing
            seminar helps create a back channel with shared awareness. An important point in
            relation to Dourish and Bly’s article is that designing for awareness and translucence
            is quite important also in physical space, and that many current spaces are
              <em class="term">mixed.</em></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p91">91</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p91">In the physical lab, screens (both public and semi-private ones) play an important role
            in representing ongoing work and in bringing in external worlds and materials
            (portholes). Activities can thus go on in both sub spaces and still retain a sense of
            co-presence and co-location without unnecessarily disturbing each other. Moreover, this
            arrangement opens up space more generally and helps coordinate collaboration. In the
            open part of HUMlab, translucence is supported through many separate, semi-private
            sections as well as through the way screens are positioned to allow a sense of ongoing
            work. The translucent nature of dividers (e.g. half-tall bookcases, hanging absorbents,
            pillars and screens, and an aquarium) allows dialogue, co-presence and some over-hearing
            between sections. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p92">92</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p92">Another relevant parameter is <em class="term">flexibility</em>. A wider range of activities and
            initiatives can be supported through allowing flexible use of an infrastructural
            resource such as HUMlab. The importance of flexibility is often emphasized in work on
            design of learning and studio environments ([<a class="ref" href="#merkel1999">Merkel 1999</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#jamieson2000">Jamieson et al. 2000</a>], and [<a class="ref" href="#gonsalvez2000">Gonsalvez &amp; Atchison 2000</a>]). Simple examples would
            include ease of reconfiguring the space and changing furniture around, allowing many
            different kinds of activities, flexible distribution of media, and a multiplex technical
            implementation. It could be argued that a flexible setup allows more change in
            pedagogical, scholarly and technological practices, whereas a fixed setup has a stronger
            investment in a particular model or framework (cf. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mitchell2003">#mitchell2003</a></span>). There
            is a tension, however, between what is flexible and what is fixed, and total flexibility
            is probably not realizable as there will always be decisions that constrain the level of
            flexibility. A totally flexible space would probably have to be a compromise. Also, some
            degree of fixedness can be part of good design practice and deliberate choices to
            encourage certain kinds of use and activities. In the case of HUMlab, and probably many
            other similar environments, there is a rather delicate balance between flexibility and
            fixedness. Some of the fixedness comes from a set of basic underlying ideas about what a
            space is and how it should be used and can be seen as part of the conceptual
            cyberinfrastructure. In some of the virtual spaces associated with HUMlab, similar
            tension can be observed. For instance when an art installation and artist (with
            assumptions of exhibition and controlled space) co-exist in the same Second Life space
            as people who are continuously doing experimental building, and who fly through the
            asserted space of the exhibition with e.g. space ships. Negotiation is often needed in
            order to resolve these clashes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p93">93</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p93">One of the things which distinguishes a studio space from a meeting room or most
            classrooms is that there is a strong sense of ongoing work and activities. There is a
            richness to such spaces which partly comes from the <em class="emph">memory and context</em>
            interwoven into the various modes of expression present and in traces from previous
            projects and people. In a design studio you will often find sketches and prototypes,
            which provide a sense of process and provide points of display and discussion. As a set
            of disciplines, the Humanities are much concerned with rich historical and cultural
            context, which would seem to be well in line with a highly contextual space. If this
            space is also flexible, it may allow for shifting contextual landscapes (e.g. through
            dynamic screens, cf. [<a class="ref" href="#manovich1995">Manovich 1995</a>]), as well as a more static or
            semi-static memory and context.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p94">94</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p94"><em class="term">Multiplexity</em> is a parameter that interrelates with translucence,
            flexibility and rich context. If complex processes and themes are important to the
            humanities as well as collaborative, trans-disciplinary projects, it is relevant to have
            a cyberinfrastructure that supports these multiple perspectives, complex data sets and
            heterogeneous context. In HUMlab, multiplexity in this sense is facilitated in
            particular through the screenscape in the new part of the lab. It allows the
            simultaneous engagement with many types of materials, ideas and perspectives through the
            screens, interaction technology, sensor technology and audio. Furthermore, many screens
            ideally have an empowering function in that there is not only one main screen, which is
            typically controlled by a teacher. Being in control of a single screen is often the same
            thing as having the floor. The screenscape in HUmlab can be controlled by one user, all
            the screens can be used together, or single users can use one or more screens
            individually. In HUMlab, multiplexity is also supported through the many different kinds
            of meeting and work places in the total studio space and through digitally supported
            spaces. In addition, the technology setup is multiplex in that it includes a variety of
            technologies, systems and software. It is quite common that students give this varied
            setup as an important reason for working and studying in HUMlab. Most technology rich
            labs at the university are either generic (basically providing browsing, word processing
            and printing) or program or department specific (often being highly specific and
            restricted as e.g. 3D modelling labs at the computer science department). One underlying
            idea in HUMlab is that a varied technological setup can afford exploration and many
            different types of activities and cross-over effects.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p95">95</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p95"><em class="term">Non-linearity</em> and <em class="term">messiness</em> is about the importance of having

            When the class is over, the norm is typically and understandably that the room should be

            horizontal in the sense that floors and ceilings are rarely used beyond their obvious

            might be argued that a high-intensity space encourages engagement, collaboration and
            exploration. It is, of course, impossible to pinpoint exactly what gives a space such
            qualities, but it would seem that non-sterile and heterogeneous spaces are more likely
            to evoke this kind of sentiment, and that a sense of energy can be derived from many
            (different) people sharing the same space, from ongoing creative work, from a sense of
            process and from a culture that supports collaboration, community and dialogue. The flow
            of people gathering for different activities, project meetings and their own work is
            quite important in this context, and the constant influx of new people such as visiting
            postdoctoral fellows and guest speakers adds to that energy as well as integration of
            external materials and distributed presence. Physical elements can clearly play an
            important role here, and examples from HUMlab include the neon sign outside the lab,
            beanbags, inviting couches and tables for meetings and coffee drinking, pictorial mats,
            designer wallpaper, nice-looking whiteboards, plants and a large aquarium. These

            engaging technology-rich environment, but their meaningfulness is also contextual and

            phase or regular long-term maintenance plan, there is a need to think about space as a
            dynamic and evolving entity that is intrinsically linked to users and inhabitants of
            that space as well as any underlying ideational grounding. Actual use of a planned space
            can be predicted and simulated, but use of space is contextual, social and, at least
            sometimes, unpredictable. It may be possible to make a distinction between flexibility

            multi-level and often distinctly material and highly abstract at the same time. With an
            inclusive definition of research infrastructure, almost anything needed to carry out
            research in the humanities could be included: ranging from paper, pens, books, furniture
            and people to database structures, grid computing facilities, visualization centers and
            libraries. We saw in Part I how cyberinfrastructure can be seen as a science and
            engineering project associated with funding mechanisms, policy making and high-cost
            research equipment of national or international interest. In Part II, a specific
            humanities infrastructure was presented and analyzed, and related to design principles
            and an ideational level, called conceptual cyberinfrastructure. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p103">103</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p103">If we regard cyberinfrastructure as a system, it could be argued that the humanities
            needs to look at its own existing and future infrastructure in systemic terms. Through
            arguing for a diversified but conceptually unified infrastructure, it may be possible to
            both match the epistemic scope of the humanities and incorporate elements that would be
            difficult to incorporate if the focus is on isolated pieces of equipment. For instance,
            if we see a centrally located seminar table as important to a planned instance of
            humanities infrastructure<a class="noteRef" href="#d35429e856">[1]</a>, it should be part of
            our conceptual framing and implementation. A diversified, but amalgated, infrastructure
            is also in line with a broad notion of infrastructure suggested by the ‘infrastructure
            turn’. Part II provided an example of how a specific humanities infrastructure can be
            packaged and unpackaged in this way. We will now look more closely at some aspects of
            packaging and implementing humanities cyberinfrastructure. </div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Some General Reflections</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p104">104</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p104">In this article, it has been argued that it is vital that the humanities engage in
            conversations about research infrastructure and articulation of possible infrastructural
            needs. It seems reasonable to see the <em class="term">infrastructure turn</em> as an important
            possibility for the humanities, but one laden with assumptions, political context and
            some risks. For instance, we need to be careful not to uncritically buy into a science
            and engineering paradigm or only using existing infrastructure, such as libraries, as a
            default model for new infrastructure. Articulating a humanities-based notion of
            cyberinfrastructure requires reflection and careful consideration, but also strategic
            action and interest in implementation. However, we also need to learn from each other
            and from disciplines and areas that have a strong infrastructural tradition [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2010a">Rockwell 2010</a>]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p105">105</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p105">It would seem sensible to let the process from idea to actual implementation take time
            given the often high cost of research infrastructure and the relative lack of
            established infrastructural framing for the humanities. Rockwell argues that we should
            support research infrastructure experiments [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2010a">Rockwell 2010</a>]. Indeed,
            conceptual sketches, digital models, simulations and different kinds of prototyping are
            important tools in considering, testing, and evaluating suggested infrastructures.
            Mockups, structural diagrams and user trials can help thinking through a digital
            database tool, and a small-size lab installation can generate important knowledge for a
            planned large-scale installation. Moreover, a digital humanities laboratory or center
            can be seen as an experimental space or playground in itself. In the case of HUMlab,
            this has been manifested through having a wide variety of technologies and competencies
            available in the lab, and encouraging exploration and experimentation. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p106">106</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p106">One common assumption, sometimes even a defining criterion, evident in the discourse on
            cyberinfrastructure is that research infrastructure is distributed. Not just in the
            sense of data or tools being located elsewhere, but in the sense of a shared vision of a
            distributed research space. When discussing virtual organizations, Cummings et al. say
            that through coordinated infrastructure, "scientists and
                engineers can work together in environments that allow scientific integration,
                greater access, efficient problem solving, and competitive advantage" [<a class="ref" href="#cummings2008">Cummings et al. 2008</a>, 3]. (The main title for their report is
            illustratively "Beyond Being There.") Atkins et al. talk
            about distributed "laboratories without walls" as a major
            emergent development [<a class="ref" href="#atkins2003">Atkins et al. 2003</a>, 13]. Typically, work and data are
            not seen as simply distributed, but are said to require high capacity networks and
            distributed computing power. While most digital humanities infrastructures are
            distributed in one sense or another, it might be argued that physical space and local
            context can be quite important infrastructural components, and that we do not
            necessarily need to buy into a "placeless," high-capacity and all-distributed sense
            of infrastructure. It could be claimed that the digital humanities operate across a
            spectrum of distributedness. Twitter, Zotero, Flickr and Second Life are all examples of
            distributed platforms that could be integrated in many digital humanities contexts as
            well as complex database systems, online tools, live shared visualizations and grid
            computing. While all of these elements can potentially be integrated in a physical lab
            or studio space, many will not. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p107">107</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p107">As we have noted, a related assumption is that technology included in
            cyberinfrastructure needs to be high-capacity, top-of-the-line and advanced. Grid
            computing is much more likely to be incorporated in this kind of discourse than, say,
            Zotero and non-massive datasets. The NSF Blue-ribbon report on cyberinfrastructure [<a class="ref" href="#atkins2003">Atkins et al. 2003</a>] contains 55 instances of the word "advanced" and 21
            instances of the collocation "advanced cyberinfrastructure." It is
            pointed out that "[b]y advanced we mean both the
                highest-performing technology and its use in the most leading-edge
                research" [<a class="ref" href="#atkins2003">Atkins et al. 2003</a>, 5] (original emphasis). This
            is an example of how certain expectations in fact define what is and what is not
            research infrastructure. While a platform such as Twitter may not match these
            expectations, it is worth carefully considering Matthew Kirschenbaum’s question:
                "Q: Has Twitter done more as DH cyberinfrastructure than
                any dedicated effort to date?" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2010">#kirschenbaum2010</a></span>. The
            templates of cyberinfrastructure, however, can be tweaked and reframed if necessary. For
            example, through advocating for a varied and multiplex research infrastructure for the
            humanities, it may be possible to gain enough leverage for it to qualify as
            cyberinfrastructure, while not sacrificing many of the technologies and uses that may
            not qualify as research infrastructure by themselves.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p108">108</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p108">We will now briefly look at some issues that have been quite important to establishing
            HUMlab as infrastructure, which have more general applicability: the framing of
            cyberinfrastructure, the importance of owning the port, the humanities pushing the
            technological envelope and why we need to speak up.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Framing Humanities Cyberinfrastructure</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p109">109</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p109">Funding is a central concern for most infrastructural projects. Here the humanities
            often find themselves in a position where sources of funding are mainly adapted to other
            areas. At one point, HUMlab attempted to apply for research infrastructure funding of a
            fairly traditional science and engineering kind although this focus was never made fully
            explicit. One problem in this application was matching the funding agency’s expectations
            of infrastructure with the planned implementation. For instance, the call in question
            made it clear that applications should be for functional units and that these units are
            normally quite costly (this category of funding was for expensive equipment). The type
            of infrastructure envisioned had some high-cost parts, but was much more diverse and
            distributed than what was clearly expected in this context – anchored in the idea of a
            fairly broadly conceived humanities and technology lab. The prototypical candidate for
            this kind of call was probably an expensive microscope, spectrometer or high performance
            computing unit; all functional and physical units of considerable cost. The application
            was not successful, but it was a useful exercise in that it made it clear to us that we
            needed to frame the cyberinfrastructure of the lab – not necessarily to conform with the
            expectations of the funding agencies, but rather to make a convincing argument for a
            different type of infrastructural need based on a different epistemic scope. The framing
            that developed from this process emphasized multiplexity (the need for many different
            kinds of perspectives, technology and infrastructure), local and distributed
            collaboration (partly through shared presence and materials), experimentation (the need
            to try infrastructure out together with humanists), openness (the infrastructure would
            attract humanities researchers but also many others) and a high degree of access to the
            infrastructure (24 hours all year).</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Owning the Port</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p110">110</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p110">There were some important decisions made at an early stage that shaped HUMlab’s basic
            infrastructure and that were also partly a result of good relations with the
            university-wide computer central. For instance, at the point at which HUMlab was started
            the most logical choice would probably have been to make the network proxy-based like in
            most of the student laboratories. However, this would have made the lab network more
            closed and it would have been difficult to make use of some software requiring specific
            network ports to be open (such as some virtual world software and some systems for
            streaming media). The fact that HUMlab was given the kind of network connection used in
            faculty and staff offices was important and allowed experimentation that would not have
            been possible, or at least difficult, otherwise. This particular issue would probably
            not be very relevant in relation to present-day installations, but there are many other
            choices and considerations that may similarly create obstacles or possibilities (some of
            which are so-called "last mile" problems). Some of them may seem like purely
            technical low-level considerations without any obvious <em class="emph">content</em> repercussions, but
            if possible, it is important to be involved in such decisions, and have people on board
            with a good sense of technical infrastructure as well as with an engagement in the
            humanities and the interface between the humanities and technology. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p111">111</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p111">Another low-level technology example concerns a rather inconspicuous metallic box
            mounted on one of the HUMlab walls. The box contains six pairs of optical fiber
            connected to the university computer central and the virtual reality lab. Without good
            support from the central university administration this installation would not have
            happened, and one general experience is that it is important to get as much done as
            possible at the point of installation. The box has never actually been used, although
            there were some fairly feeble attempts to connect HUMlab to the virtual reality
            laboratory at one point. Thus, this is clearly a failed investment on one level. The
            original rationale was for connecting high-level visualization facilities, and for
            future (largely undefined) use. Even though the connection has not been used in the 10
            years since it was installed, it might be argued that it has provided high-level
            bandwidth and connective possibilities (although unrealized). Of course this non-use is
            not optimal, but it can also be seen as part of providing a good base level
            infrastructure. There is also often a window of opportunity when initial investments and
            construction work are being done. Certain installations can often be done fairly easily
            done as part of a larger construction project. And when looking at future expansion
            plans and creating portals between HUMlab and HUMlab-X, and between HUMlab and several
            international digital humanities centers there has indeed been renewed interest in the
            dedicated optical fiber connection.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Conceptual Cyberinfrastructure and Humanities-based Technological Innovation</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p112">112</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p112">Most digital humanities cyberinfrastructures are likely to incorporate technology to at
            least some, but often considerable, extent, and going from idea and concept to actual
            implementation is not always a simple or fast process. If all it takes is a number of
            standard workstations, or a standard database server, there will most likely not be a
            problem, but larger and non-standard installations are often complex. This is true
            generally speaking, and it is important to have a clear vision and to be able to
            communicate with technology experts in a dialogic and informed fashion. In the case of
            humanities infrastructures, which may be built on different epistemics, there may be
            problems that stem from the differentness of the envisioned installation. In such
            situations, it is quite important to be knowledgeable and communicative enough to be
            able to work the planning and implementation processes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p113">113</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p113">Returning to the screenscape in HUMlab, this installation did not fit the template in
            several ways. For instance, the standard multiple screen scenario combines screens to
            create larger, seamless displays. Having screens spread out at the periphery of a large
            space is less common. Several participants in the design process argued in favor of one
            large screenscape which connected the screens seamlessly (rather than having them
            separate). Installing the 11 large screens was not a major technical problem, however,
            rather the complexity lay with how they are controlled and made accessible. Also, the
            screenscape included a 4K projector with very high resolution, which added an additional
            layer of complexity. The basic idea of rich contextualization, humanities-based
            representation and flexibility was implemented through a complex system where the total
            screenscape can be run through dedicated computers (one computer per screen), from one
            computer with an 11-screen desktop or through a video signal level system (where 24
            sources irrespective of type can be placed in the screenscape). This is obviously not an
            off-the-shelf system, and it is critical to be able to not lose track of epistemic
            grounding and the basic idea while discussing implementation with researchers, experts
            and others, and when carrying out the implementation. HUMlab’s screenscape is an example
            of a humanities infrastructural installation pushing the technical boundaries - and this
            is a recurring experience. When the head of one of the computer functions at the
            university described HUMlab at one point he said that it is the most interesting
            technology space on campus. The point here is that it is quite possible for the
            humanities to create a functional and highly visible platform, and that epistemic
            commitments of the humanities disciplines can make for interesting technological
            challenges that will often attract students and experts from the fields of technology
            and engineering.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Speaking Up</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p114">114</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p114">Implementing large, and also often smaller, infrastructural projects in a university
            context is typically a fairly complicated processes with many people, competencies,
            sub-processes and different levels of decision and policy making involved. The degree of
            control and expected involvement depends on many different factors, but in any case,
            anyone involved in this kind of process as a main agent will have to take part in any
            number of meetings, negotiations and concerns about low-level technical and
            constructional details. Speaking up is important. Here design principles can be useful
            as a kind of intermediate language and, in the case of HUMlab, working with a 3D model
            of the planned new part of the lab turned out to be very useful. Partly because the
            model allowed the exploration of different possibilities, but also because the
            "finished" model served very well when planning the actual implementation with
            international experts, contractors, the property owner and university

            grounding and the layout are very clear in the actual implementation. Apart from still
            visualizations, associated animations were also created, and these proved quite useful
            in general presentations of HUMlab and when discussing the project with funding
            agencies. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p116">116</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p116">As has been noted, seemingly small decisions can have significant impact. It is often
            useful to follow the implementation process quite closely and to talk to the people
            involved in the actual implementation (construction workers, engineer, programmers etc.)
            continuously. This allows you to ensure everyone has a sense of what the installation is
            about, learn from each other, and react if there are any misunderstandings. Sometimes
            there might be very different views on the impact of certain decisions. On one occasion
            in the planning of the new part of HUMlab, there was a meeting with most of the
            contractors, university administration and the property owner, where one point of
            disagreement was the new cooling and ventilation system for both parts of the lab. As
            mentioned previously, upgrades of existing infrastructure are often easier when you are
            doing new installations. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p117">117</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p117">The plan that had been decided on included partially lowering the ceiling in the old
            part of the lab. Even if this may seem like a fairly significant change, it had not been
            communicated verbally, and even if HUMlab had had access to the relevant drawings, they
            would have been difficult to decipher for laymen. The point here is that to the
            contractors this was not a major change. They needed to fit large pipes above the
            ceiling and the most reasonable way to do this would be to lower the ceiling – a matter
            of implementation. At this point, only the HUMlab representative (among 15 people) spoke
            up and articulated the importance of the varying ceiling heights of the lab, and how it
            would be very unfortunate to implement this change. The argument was not functional in a
            strict sense but rather aesthetic and about the energy and sense of the space. Through
            support from the university administration the contractors were asked to see if there
            were any alternative solutions (although it had been said earlier that there was only
            that one possibility). When the rationale had been communicated the contractors found an
            alternative solution, and eventually a way was found to keep the ceiling intact. Also,
            the intricacies of the ceiling scape (above the visible ceiling) became much clearer to
            the HUMlab representative.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p118">118</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p118">Another interesting point of negotiation concerned wallpapering four pillars with a

            or not suitable no less than three times. This may partly have been a gendered
            experience as the two interior decorators were women proposing an atypical use of
            wallpaper to a totally male dominated work and management group. The issue was resolved
            after HUMlab made it quite clear that the wallpaper was very important to the whole
            expansion. It turned out that one rationale for the initial unwillingness to wallpaper
            the pillars (for the workers) was that it would not be possible to do high-quality
            wallpapering on the round but multi-faceted pillars. Afterwards, everyone involved
            agreed on the success of the wallpapered pillars as concept and implementation. A
            general finding here is that intense collaboration and talking are critical, and that
            there is real value to clearly articulating what we, as part of the core operation of
            the university (research and teaching), need in order to carry out or work.</div></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p119">119</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p119">Speaking up must be done on many levels. At a workshop on humanities cyberinfrastructure
          at UC Irvine in 2006, there was an appeal (or maybe request) from Dan Atkins, then head of
          the NSF Office of Cyberinfrastructure, that the humanities and social sciences step up and
          show leadership in relation to the issue of future cyberinfrastructure. This article can
          partly be seen as a response to this request in the sense of suggesting a model grounded
          in core humanities challenges, the conceptual cyberinfrastructure to tackle those
          challenges (if any), as well as in design principles and as exemplified in implemented
          cyberinfrastructure. We need to reflect critically on cyberinfrastructure, explore
          ideational and technological visions, and think about the future of the humanities. The
          call is arguably ours.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Acknowledgements</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p120">120</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p120">I draw on dialogue and collaboration with a great many people, and I would like to
