    in Bush's earlier work with analog computing machines, and his understanding of the technique of
    associative memory. It argues that Memex was the product of a particular engineering culture,
    and that the machines that preceded Memex — the Differential Analyzer and the Selector in
    particular — helped engender this culture, and the discourse of analogue computing itself.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction: Technical Evolution</h1><blockquote><p class="ptext">The key difference [between material cultural evolution and biological evolution] is
     that biological systems predominantly have "vertical" transmission of
     genetically ensconced information, meaning parents to offspring… Not so in material cultural
     systems, where horizontal transfer is rife — and arguably the more important dynamic . (<a href="#eldredge2004">Paleontologist Dr. Niles Eldredge, interview with the author</a>)</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Since the early days of Darwinism, analogies have been drawn between biological evolution and
    the evolution of technical objects and systems. It is obvious that technologies change over
    time; we can see this in the fact that technologies come in generations; they adapt and adopt
    characteristics over time, "one suppressing the other as it becomes obsolete" [<a class="ref" href="#guattari1995">Guattari 1995</a>, 40]. The technical artefact constitutes a series of objects,
    a "lineage" or a line. From the middle of the nineteenth century on, writers have
    been remarking on this basic analogy – and on the alarming rate at which technological change is
    accelerating. But as Eldredge points out, the analogy can only go so far; technological systems are not like
    biological systems in a number of important ways, most obviously the fact that they are the
    products of conscious design. Unlike biological organisms, technical objects are
    <em class="emph">invented</em>. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Inventors learn by experience and experiment, and they learn by watching other machines work
    in the form of technical prototypes. They also copy and "transfer" ideas and
    techniques between machines, co-opting innovations at a whim. Technological innovation thus has
    Lamarckian features, which are forbidden in biology [<a class="ref" href="#ziman2003">Ziman 2003</a>, 5].
    Inventors can borrow ideas from contemporary technologies, or even from the past. There is no
     "extinction" in technological evolution: ideas, designs and innovations can be
    co-opted and transferred both retroactively and laterally. This retroactive and lateral
     "transfer" of innovations is what distinguishes technical evolution from
    biological evolution, which is characterised by vertical transfer (parents to offspring). As the
    American paleontologist Niles Eldredge observed in an interview with the author,</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">Makers copy each other, patents affording only fleeting protection. Thus,
     instead of the neatly bifurcating trees [you see in biological evolution], you find what is
     best described as "networks"-consisting of an historical signal of what came before what,
     obscured often to the point of undetectability by this lateral transfer of subsequent ideas . (<a href="#eldredge2004">Niles Eldredge, interview with the author</a>)</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Can we say that technical machines have their own genealogies, their own evolutionary dynamic?
    It is my contention that we can, and I have argued elsewhere that in order to tell the story of
    a machine, one must trace the path of these transferrals, paying particular attention to
    technical <em class="emph">prototypes</em> and to also to <em class="emph">techniques</em>, or ways of doing
    things. A good working prototype can send shockwaves throughout an engineering community, and
    often inspires a host of new machines in quick succession. Similarly, an effective technique
    (for example, storing and retrieving information associatively) can spread between innovations
    rapidly.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In this article I will be telling the story of particular technical machine – Vannevar Bush’s
    Memex. Memex was an electro-mechanical device designed in the 1930’s to provide easy access to
    information stored associatively on microfilm. It is often hailed as the precursor to hypertext
    and the web. Linda C. Smith undertook a comprehensive citation context analysis of literary and
    scientific articles produced after the 1945 publication of Bush's article on the device, "As We May Think" in the <cite class="title italic">Atlantic Monthly</cite>. She
    found that there is a conviction, without dissent, that modern hypertext is traceable to this
    article [<a class="ref" href="#smith1991">Smith 1991</a>, 265]. In each decade since the Memex design was
    published, commentators have not only lauded it as vision, but also asserted that "technology [has] finally caught up with this vision" [<a class="ref" href="#smith1991">Smith 1991</a>, 278]. For all the excitement, it is important to remember that
    Memex was never actually built; it exists entirely on paper. Because the design was first
    published in the summer of 1945, at the end of a war effort and with the birth of computers,
    theorists have often associated it with the post-War information boom. In fact, Bush had been
    writing about it since the early 1930s, and the Memex paper went through several different
    versions. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The social and cultural influence of Bush’s inventions are well known, and his political role
    in the development of the atomic bomb are also well known. What is not so well known is the way
    the Memex came about as a result of both Bush’s earlier work with analog computing machines, and
    his understanding of the "mechanism" or technique of associative
    memory. I would like to show that Memex was the product of a particular engineering culture, and
    that the machines that preceded Memex — the Differential Analyzer and the Selector in particular
    — helped engender this culture, and the discourse of analogue computing, in the first place. The
    artefacts of engineering, particularly in the context of a school such as MIT, are themselves
    productive of new techniques and new engineering paradigms. Prototype technologies create
    cultures of use around themselves; they create new techniques and new methods that were
    unthinkable prior to the technology. This was especially so for the Analyzer. </div><blockquote><p class="ptext">In the context of the early 20th-century engineering school, the analyzers
     were not only tools but paradigms, and they taught mathematics and method and modeled the
     character of engineering. [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 6]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Bush transferred technologies directly from the Analyzer and also the Selector into the design
    of Memex. I will trace this transfer in the first section. He also transferred an
    electro-mechanical model of human associative memory from the nascent science of cybernetics,
    which he was exposed to at MIT, into Memex. We will explore this in the second section. In both
    cases, we will be paying particular attention to the structure and architecture of the
    technologies concerned.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The idea that technical artefacts evolve in this way, by the transfer of both technical
    innovations (for example, microfilm) and techniques (for example, association as a storage
    technique), was popularised by French technology historian Bertrand Gille. I will be mobilising
    Gille’s theories here as I trace the evolution of the Memex design. We will begin with Bush’s
    first analogue computer, the Differential Analyzer.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Analyzer and the Selector</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The Differential Analyzer was a giant, electromechanical gear and shaft machine which was put
    to work during the war calculating artillery ranging tables and the profiles of radar antennas.
    In the late 1930s and early 1940s, it was "the most important computer in
     existence in the US" [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 3]. Before this time, the word "computer" had
    meant a large group of mostly female humans performing equations by hand or on limited
    mechanical calculators. The Analyzer evaluated and solved these equations by mechanical
    integration. It created a small revolution at MIT. Many of the people who worked on the machine
    (e.g. Harold Hazen, Gordon Brown, Claude Shannon) later made contributions to feedback control,
    information theory, and computing [<a class="ref" href="#mindell2000">Mindell 2000</a>]. The machine was a huge success
    which brought prestige and a flood of federal money to MIT and Bush. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">However, by the spring of 1950, the Analyzer was gathering dust in a storeroom — the project
    had died. Why did it fail? Why did the world’s most important analogue computer end up in a back
    room within five years? This story will itself be related to why Memex was never built; research
    into analogue computing technology in the interwar years, the Analyzer in particular,
    contributed to the rise of digital computing. It demonstrated that <em class="emph">machines could automate
     the calculus</em>, that machines could automate human cognitive techniques.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">The decade between the Great War and the Depression was a bull market for engineering [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 29]. Enrolment in the MIT Electrical Engineering Department almost
    doubled in this period, and the decade witnessed the rapid expansion of graduate programs. The
    interwar years found corporate and philanthropic donors more willing to fund research and
    development within engineering departments, and there were serious problems to be worked on
    generated by communications failures during the Great War. In particular, engineers were trying
    to predict the operating characteristics of power-transmission lines, long-distance telephone
    lines, commercial radio and other communications technologies (Beniger calls this the "early" period of the Control Revolution [<a class="ref" href="#beniger1986">Beniger 1986</a>, 19]). MIT’s Engineering Department undertook a major assault on the mathematical study
    of long-distance lines. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Of particular interest to the engineers was the Carson equation for transmission lines. This
    was a simple equation, but it required intensive mathematical integration to solve.</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">Early in 1925 Bush suggested to his Graduate Student Herbert Stewart that he
    devise a machine to facilitate the recording of the areas needed for the Carson equation … [and
    a colleague] suggested that Stewart interpret the equation electrically rather than mechanically. [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 7]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">So the equation was transferred to an electro-mechanical device: the Product Intergraph. Many
    of the early analogue computers that followed Bush’s machines were designed to automate existing
    mathematical equations. This particular machine physically mirrored the equation itself. It
    incorporated the use of a mechanical "integrator" to record the areas
    under the curves (and thus the integrals), which was</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">… in essence a variable-speed gear, and took the form of a rotating
     horizontal disk on which a small knife-edged wheel rested. The wheel was driven by friction,
     and the gear ratio was altered by varying the distance of the wheel from the axis of rotation
     of the disk. [<a class="ref" href="#hartree2000">Hartree 2000</a>]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">A second version of this machine incorporated two wheel-and-disc integrators, and it was a
    great success. Bush observed the success of the machine, and particularly the later
    incorporation of the two wheel-and-disc integrators, and decided to make a larger one, with more
    integrators and a more general application than the Carson equation. By the fall of 1928, Bush
    had secured funds from MIT to build a new machine. He called it the Differential Analyzer, after
    an earlier device proposed by Lord Kelvin which might externalise the calculus and "mechanically integrate" its solution [<a class="ref" href="#hartree2000">Hartree 2000</a>]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">As Bertrand Gille observes, a large part of technical invention occurs by transfer, whereby
    the functioning of a structure is analogically transposed onto another structure, or the same
    structure is generalised outwards [<a class="ref" href="#gille1986">Gille 1986</a>, 40]. This is what happened
    with the Analyzer — Bush saw the outline of such a machine in the Product Integraph. The
    Differential Analyzer was rapidly assembled in 1930, and part of the reason it was so quickly
    done was that it incorporated a number of existing engineering developments, particularly a
    device called a torque amplifier, designed by Niemann [<a class="ref" href="#shurkin1996">Shurkin 1996</a>, 97]. But
    the disk integrator, a technology borrowed from the Product Intergraph, was the heart of the
    Analyzer and the means by which it performed its calculations. When combined with the torque
    amplifier, the Analyzer was "essentially an elegant, dynamical, mechanical
     model of the differential equation" [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 14]. Although Lord Kelvin had suggested such a machine
    previously, Bush was the first to build it on such a large scale, and it happened at a time when
    there was a general and urgent need for such precision. It created a small revolution at MIT.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">In engineering science, there is an emphasis on working prototypes or
    "deliverables". As Professor of Computer Science Andries van Dam put it in an
    interview with the author, when engineers talk about work, they mean "work
     in the sense of machines, software, algorithms, things that are <em class="emph">concrete</em>" [<a class="ref" href="#vandam1999">Van Dam 1999</a>]. This emphasis on concrete work was the same in Bush’s time. Bush
    had delivered something which had been previously only been dreamed about; this meant that
    others could come to the laboratory and learn by observing the machine, by watching it
    integrate, by imagining other applications. A working prototype is different to a dream or white
    paper — it actually creates its own milieu, it <em class="emph">teaches those who use it</em> about the
    possibilities it contains and its material technical limits. Bush himself recognised this, and
    believed that those who used the machine acquired what he called a "mechanical calculus", an internalised knowledge of the machine. When the army wanted to
    build their own machine at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, he sent them a mechanic who had helped
    construct the Analyzer. The army wanted to pay the man machinist’s wages; Bush insisted he be
    hired as a consultant [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 24]. <blockquote><p>I never consciously taught this man any part of the subject of differential
      equations; but in building that machine, managing it, he learned what differential equations
      were himself … [it] was interesting to discuss the subject with him because he had learned the
      calculus in mechanical terms — a strange approach, and yet he understood it. That is, he did
      not understand it in any formal sense, he understood the fundamentals; he had it under his
      skin. (<a href="#bush1970">Bush 1970, 262 cited in Owens 1991, 24</a>)</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Watching the Analyzer work did more than just teach people about the calculus. It also taught
    people about what might be possible for mechanical calculation — for <em class="emph">analogue
    computers</em>. Several laboratories asked for plans, and duplicates were set up at the US
    Army’s Ballistic Research Laboratory, in Maryland, and at the Moore School of Electrical
    Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania [<a class="ref" href="#shurkin1996">Shurkin 1996</a>, 99]. The machine
    assembled at the Moore school was much larger than the MIT machine, and the engineers had the
    advantage of being able to learn from the mistakes and limits of the MIT machine [<a class="ref" href="#shurkin1996">Shurkin 1996</a>, 102]. Bush also created several more Analyzers, and in 1936 the Rockefeller
    Foundation awarded MIT $85,000 to build the Rockefeller Differential Analyzer [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 17]. This provided more opportunities for graduate research, and
    brought prestige and a flood of funding to MIT. </div><blockquote><p class="ptext">But what is interesting about the Rockefeller Differential Analyzer is what
    remained the same. Electrically or not, automatically or not, the newest edition of Bush’s
    analyzer still interpreted mathematics in terms of mechanical rotations, still depended on
    expertly machined wheel-and-disc integrators, and still drew its answers as curves. [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 32]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Its technical processes remained the same. It was an analogue device, and it literally turned
    around a central analogy: the rotation of the wheel shall be the area under the graph (and thus
    the integrals). The Analyzer directly mirrored the task at hand; there was a mathematical
    transparency to it which at once held observers captive and promoted, in its very workings, the
     "language of early 20th-century engineering" [<a class="ref" href="#owens1991">Owens 1991</a>, 32]. There were visitors to the lab, and military and corporate
    representatives that would watch the machine turn its motions. It seemed the adumbration of
    future technology. Harold Hazen, the head of the Electrical Engineering Department in 1940
    predicted the Analyzer would "mark the start of a new era in mechanized
     calculus" (<a href="#hazen1940">Hazen 1940, 101 cited in Owens 1991, 4</a>). Analogue technology held
    much promise, especially for military computation — and the Analyzer had created a new era. The

    believed, it mirrored the operations of the human mind and memory. Bush began the project in

    problems shifting the optical reader between the two message tapes. Bush was working on the
    Analyzer at the time, and didn’t have the resources to fix these components effectively. By the

    argued that "a great deal of our brain cell activity is closely parallel to
     the operation of relay circuits", and that "one can explore this
     parallelism…almost indefinitely" (<span class="error"><a href="#nyce1991 ">November 6, 1944; cited in Nyce and Kahn 1991, 62</a></span>). </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">In the 1930s and 1940s, the popular scientific conception of mind and memory was a mechanical
    one. An object or experience was perceived, transferred to the memory-library's receiving
    station, and then "installed in the memory-library for all future reference" [<a class="ref" href="#dennett1993">Dennett 1993</a>, 121]. It had been known since the early 1900s that the brain
    comprised a tangle of neuronal groups that were interconnected in the manner of a network, and
    recent research had shown that these communicated and "stored" information across
    the neural substrate, in some instances creating further connections, via minute electrical
     "vibrations". According to Bush, memories that were not accessed regularly
    suffered from this neglect by the conscious mind and were prone to fade. The pathways of the
    brain, its indexing system, needed constant electrical stimulation to remain strong. This was
    the problem with the neural network: "items are not fully permanent, memory
     is transitory" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bush1945">#bush1945</a></span>. The major technical problem with human memory was its

    analogues at the time as models to boost human functions. The military had been attempting to
    develop technologies which mimicked and subsequently replaced human faculties for many years
     [<a class="ref" href="#delanda1994">De Landa 1994</a>, 127] and this was especially heightened in the years before,
    during and immediately following the war. At MIT in particular, there was a tendency to take
     "the image of the machine as the basis for the understanding of man"
    and vice versa, writes Harold Hatt in his book on Cybernetics [<a class="ref" href="#hatt1968">Hatt 1968</a>, 28]. The idea that Man and his environment are mechanical systems which can be studied, improved,
    mimicked and controlled was growing, and later gave way to disciplines such as cognitive science
    and artificial intelligence. Wiener and McCulloch "looked for and worked
     from parallels they saw between neural structure and process and computation" [<a class="ref" href="#nyce1991">Nyce 1991</a>, 63], a model which changed with the onset of digital computing to

     thought with and in these terms, he built technological projects with them" [<a class="ref" href="#nyce1991">Nyce 1991</a>, 62]. The first step was understanding the mechanical
     "process" or nature of thought itself; the second step was transferring this
    process to a machine. So there is a double movement within Bush’s work, the location of a
     "natural" human process within thought, a process which is already machine-like,
    and the subsequent refinement and modelling of a particular technology on that process.
    Technology should depart from nature, it should depart from an extant human process: this saves
    us so much work. If this is done properly, "[it] should be possible to beat

    that the mind makes through information: a mechanical analogue to an already mechanical model of
    memory. Bush transferred this idea into information management; Memex was distinct from
    traditional forms of indexing not so much in its mechanism or content, but in the way it
    organised information based on association. The design did not spring from the ether, however;

    large-scale engineering project to combine lower-level, extant technologies and automate what
    was previously a human cognitive technique: the integral calculus. It incorporated two
    lower-level analogue technologies to accomplish this task: the wheel-and-disk integrator and the
    torque amplifier, as we have explored. Surrounded by computers and personal organisers, the idea
    of automating intellectual processes seems obvious to us now — but in the early 1930s the idea
    of automating what was essentially a <em class="emph">function within thought</em> was radical. Bush
    needed to convince people that it was worthwhile. In 1939, Bush wrote:</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">The future means of implementing thought are … fully as worthy of attention

     <span class="foreign i">qua</span> technical artefact, the method proved successful. Design on the first
    microfilm selection device, the Comparator, started in 1935. This, too, was a machine to aid the
    mind: it was essentially a counting machine, to tally the coincidence of letters in two messages
    or copies of a single message. It externalised the "drudge" work of
    cryptography, and Bush "rightly saw it as the first electronic
     data-processing machine" [<a class="ref" href="#burke1991">Burke 1991</a>, 147]. The Rapid Selector which followed it incorporated much of
    the same architecture, as we have explored — and this architecture was in turn transferred to
    Memex. </div><blockquote><p class="ptext">The Memex-like machine proposed in Bush’s 1937 memo to Weaver shows just how
     much [the Selector] and the Memex have in common. In the rapid selector, low-level mechanisms
     for transporting 35mm film, photo-sensors to detect dot patterns, and precise timing mechanisms
     combined to support the high-order task of information selection. In Memex, photo-optic
     selection devices, keyboard controls, and dry photography would be combined … to support the

    technique (a technique which was itself quite popular among the nascent cybernetics community at
    MIT, and already articulated mind and machine together). By describing an imaginary machine,
    Bush had "selected from the existing technologies of the time and made a
     case for how they should develop in the future" [<a class="ref" href="#nyce1991">Nyce 1991</a>, 45]. But this forecasting did not come from some genetically

    technologies which the general public, and engineers at other smaller schools, did not have
    access to. Bush had a more "global" view of the combinatory possibilities and the
    technological lineage. Bush himself admitted this; in fact, he believed that engineers and
    scientists were the only people who could or <em class="emph">should</em> predict the future of
    technology — anyone else had no idea. In "The Inscrutable Thirties",
    an essay he published in 1933, he tells us that politicians and the general public simply can’t

    concept derived from work in neuronal storage-retrieval networks at the time, which was a method
    of connecting information by linking units together in a networked manner, similar to hypertext
    paths. The process of making trails was called "trailblazing", and
    was based on a mechanical provision "whereby any item may be caused at will

Electro-optical devices borrowed from the Rapid Selector
    used spinning rolls of microfilm, abstract codes and a mechanical selection-head inside the desk

    how others were responding at the time. By 1967, for example, great advances had been made in
    digital memory techniques. As far back as 1951, the Eckert-Mauchly division of Remington Rand
    had turned over the first "digital" computer with a stored-program architecture,
    the UNIVAC, to the US Census Bureau [<a class="ref" href="#ceruzzi1998">Ceruzzi 1998</a>, 27]. "Delay

    technology, and did not mirror or seek to mirror "natural" processes in any way.
    It steadily replaced the most popular form of electro-mechanical memory from the late 1940s and
    early 1950s: drum memory. This was a large metal cylinder which rotated rapidly beneath a
    mechanical head, where information was written across the surface magnetically [<a class="ref" href="#ceruzzi1998">Ceruzzi 1998</a>, 38]. In 1957, disk memory had been produced, for the IBM305 RAMAC,

    technology of the future, and encouraging the public that "the time has come
     to try it again" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bush1959">#bush1959</a></span>.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Memex, Inheritance and Transmission</h1><blockquote><p class="ptext">No memex could have been built when that article appeared. In the
    quarter-century since then, the idea has been with me almost constantly, and I have watched new
    developments in electronics, physics, chemistry and logic to see how they might help bring it to
    reality [<a class="ref" href="#bush1970">Bush 1970</a>, 190].</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p69">69</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p69">Memex became an image of potentiality for Bush near the end of his life. In the later essays,
    he writes in a different tone entirely: Memex was an image he would bequeath to the future, a
    gift to the human race. For most of his professional life, he had been concerned with augmenting
    human memory, and preserving information that might be lost to human beings. He had occasionally
    written about this project as a larger idea which would boost "the entire
     process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bush1945">#bush1945</a></span>. But in <cite class="title italic">Memex II</cite>, this project
    became grander, more urgent — the idea itself far more important than the technical details. He
    was nearing the end of his life, and Memex was still unbuilt. Would someone eventually build
    this machine? He hoped so, and he urged the public that it would soon be possible to do this, or
    at least, the "day has come far closer"[<a class="ref" href="#bush1970">Bush 1970</a>, 190]: "in the interval since that paper
      [<cite class="title italic">As We May Think</cite>] was published, there have been many
     developments … steps that were merely dreams are coming into the realm of practicality"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bush1959">#bush1959</a></span>. Could this image be externalised now, and live beyond him?
    It would not only carry the wealth of his own knowledge beyond his death, it would be like a
    gift to all mankind. In fact, Memex would be the centrepiece of mankind’s <em class="emph">true
    revolution</em> — transcending death.</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">Can a son inherit the memex of his father, refined and polished over the
    years, and go on from there? In this way can we avoid some of the loss which comes when oxygen
    is no longer furnished to the brain of the great thinker, when all the patterns of neurons so
    painstakingly refined become merely a mass of protein and nucleic acid? Can the race thus
    develop leaders, of such power and intellect, and such forces of conviction, that the world can
    be saved from its follies? This is an objective of far greater importance than the conquest of
    disease, even than the conquest of mental aberrations <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bush1959">#bush1959</a></span>.</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p70">70</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p70">Near the end of his life, Bush thought of Memex as more than just an <em class="emph">individual’s</em>
    machine; the "ultimate [machine] is far more subtle than this" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bush1959">#bush1959</a></span>. Memex would be the centrepiece of a structure of
    inheritance and transmission, a structure that would accumulate with each successive generation.
    In <cite class="title italic">Science Pauses</cite>, Bush entitled one of the sections "Immortality in a machine"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bush1965">#bush1965</a></span>: it contained a description of Memex, but this time there
    was an emphasis on its "longevity" over the individual human mind
     <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bush1965">#bush1965</a></span>. This is the crux of the matter; the trails in Memex would
    not grow old, they would be a gift from father to son, from one generation to the next. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p71">71</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p71">Bush died on June 30, 1974. The image of Memex has been passed on beyond his death, and it
    continues to inspire a host of new machines and "technical
    instrumentalities". But Memex itself has never been built; it exists only on paper, in
    technical interpretation and in memory. All we have of Memex are the words that Bush assembled
    around it in his lifetime, the drawings created by the artists from <cite class="title italic">Life</cite>, its erotic simulacrum, its ideals, its ideas. Had Bush attempted to assemble this
    machine in his own lifetime, it would undoubtedly have changed in its technical workings; the
    material limits of microfilm, of photoelectric components and later, of crystalline memory
    storage would have imposed their limits; the "use function" of the machine would
    itself have changed as it demonstrated its own potentials. If Memex had been built, the object
    would have invented itself independently of the outlines Bush cast on paper. This never happened
    — it has entered into the intellectual capital of new media as an image of potentiality. </div></div></div><div id="worksCited"><h2>Works Cited</h2><div class="bibl fallback"><span class="ref" id="bagg1961"><!-- close -->Bagg and Stevens 1961</span> Bagg, T.
