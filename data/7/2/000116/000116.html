                    use Google Earth to create atlases of historical Silk Road journeys. It argues
                    that a digital humanities classroom, with clearly defined assignments and
                    extensive evaluation, is an exemplary setting for establishing and verifying
                    genre conventions and review standards. Approaches that are developed for the
                    classroom can be modified for professional settings. The authors introduce
                    criteria for evaluating digital historical atlases as works of humanistic
                    scholarship, and suggest that digital humanists do the same for other
                    disciplines and genres as well.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">I. Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">This article is inspired by Ruth Mostern’s experience teaching an undergraduate
                    history course about the Silk Road using spatial history principles and methods.
                    Half of the classroom time in this Spring 2010 course at the University of
                    California, Merced was a conventional history seminar. During the remainder of
                    the class meetings, Mostern, along with graduate research assistant Elana
                    Gainor, taught digital map design and development using Google’s popular virtual
                    globe application, Google Earth. Integrating these two practices, students
                    produced gazetteers, descriptions of historical places, interactive maps, and
                    term papers about historical Silk Road travel itineraries. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This article offers advice and lessons to others who wish to attempt such a
                    course. However, it is also an article about reviewing and evaluating digital
                    scholarship beyond the classroom. Mostern and Gainor sptook advantage of the
                    structure and highly specified assignments of an undergraduate classroom to
                    design and implement clear and actionable standards for digital historical
                    atlases. The standards shaped student work and allowed a reviewer – in this case
                    a professor with grading authority – to evaluate the results of their efforts
                    and to distinguish in a fair and systematic way between more and less effective
                    digital atlases. Classroom work and professional scholarship are not identical,
                    but many of the same review principles apply to both. Since scholarly review of
                    digital scholarship is still at an early stage of development, classrooms are a
                    valuable and accessible venue for testing and evaluating review standards. We
                    used our expertise in spatial history methods, theories and exemplars to
                    introduce the digital atlas genre, set standards for student work, and grade
                    student accomplishments. Based on our experience, we propose that our classroom
                    standards can be modified and utilized by digital atlas developers and reviewers
                    in the profession. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The first two sections of the article offer suggestions about spatial history as
                    a research and teaching practice, based on the proposition that spatial history
                    is not simply a set of techniques, but an informed approach to understanding
                    past geography. The next two sections of the article are about the Silk Road
                    class content and its implications for the digital humanities. The article
                    concludes with one section that introduces recent writing about scholarly review
                    of digital work, and another proposing guidelines for digital historical atlas
                    review informed by classroom experience and professional good practice. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">II. Interpretation and Analysis in the Spatial Humanities </h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Instructors who grade student work, as well as editors who review authors’
                    submissions, are explicitly conducting evaluation. At the same time, scholars
                    who assess how a given work contributes to their field are also engaging in
                    assessment. That is particularly true in the digital humanities, since peer
                    review and third-party publication are still rare. Putting aside technical
                    review, evaluating digital scholarship is no different than assessing any other
                    work. Those who do it recognize a work in its genre context, compare it to
                    analogous works, and determine what it adds to its field. The task implies an
                    intellectual agenda, but this has not yet been well articulated in the field of
                    digital spatial history. In the following section, we survey the intellectual
                    state of the spatial history field and propose a way forward.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">We use the term <em class="emph">digital atlas</em> to refer to the typical genre of
                    spatial history work. The term is shorthand for a multimedia project based upon
                    a mapping platform, integrating spatially referenced features with non-spatial
                    resources such as embedded or hyperlinked text, images, or video, organizing
                    spatial information into layers by category, and filtering visible display by
                    means of a time-slider for temporal scale and pan-and-zoom controls for spatial
                    scale. Digital atlas users can turn layers on and off, control visibility, and
                    explore hyperlinked data associated with georeferenced locations. Each atlas
                    depicts a topic or theme; it has a coherent spatial and temporal premise like
                    that presented on a single page in a paper atlas or a single map in a textbook.
                    However, the advantage of a digital atlas is that it is backed by a database
                    holding all the geographical information, map layers, and other resources from
                    many atlases, and the same content can be reused for multiple thematic
                        maps.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e117">[1]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6"> Humanities scholars using methods from cultural geography and geographic
                    information science have styled their practices as "geohumanities" and
                        "spatial humanities," two names for a field that has emerged in the
                    last decade.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e130">[2]</a> The
                    field involves a range of more and less computational approaches. Among them we
                    are most interested in those that involve producing digital maps of historical
                    phenomena and using them for analysis and communication. Barriers to entry for
                    geographic information systems (GIS) software and methods have declined, and
                    historians, archaeologists, and literary critics have, often in collaboration
                    with colleagues in other fields, developed exemplary projects. There are a
                    number of books and articles about methods and results; and conferences,
                    workshops and opportunities for funding have all proliferated. Stanley Fish,
                    humanities blogger at the <cite class="title italic">New York Times</cite>, devoted a
                    column to the field in summer 2011 <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#fish2011">#fish2011</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The quantity of activity in this area is impressive. However, in lieu of careful
                    development of theory, a critical apparatus, and standards of rigor and
                    excellence, advocates of the field too often rejoice in its mere existence and
                    engage in evangelism for it. The editors of the <cite class="title italic">GeoHumanities</cite> volume, for instance, celebrate the fact that "a kaleidoscope of intellectual and artistic outputs" is
                    leading to "excitement breaking out across the intellectual
                        landscape"[<a class="ref" href="#richardson2011">Richardson 2011</a>, 3]. Thus, although numerous methods for
                    spatial analysis and spatial representation in the humanities have been
                    proposed, implemented, and reported, there has been only limited critical and
                    comparative evaluation of what approaches are most appropriate for accomplishing
                    particular ends. The authors assembled in the <cite class="title italic">GeoHumanities</cite> volume, for example, include proponents of animation
                    (Ayers), gaming and immersive visualization (Harris et al.), "quantitative techniques combined with hermeneutics"
                    (von Lünen and Moschek), integrating disparate sources (Schwartz et al.) or
                    analyzing one difficult source (Hillier) using GIS, and gazetteer development
                        (Bol).<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e165">[3]</a> All
                    of the authors make excellent cases for their approaches, and all of them
                    describe successful applications of the methods in question to their own
                    projects. None of them, however, assesses which research and/or visualization
                    problems other than their own are most suitable for the method in question, or
                    whether their method is the most appropriate among a range of possibilities.
                    Finally, none of them suggest criteria by which reviewers or readers should
                    judge the quality of work produced according to the method in question, or, in
                    most cases, the suitability of the particular method in question. This omission
                    explains why we advocate reviewing and critiquing spatial humanities works, a
                    practice for identifying how they help to frame and address questions in the
                    humanities and for permitting developers to select a suitable method for a given
                    purpose.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The current state of affairs is understandable for an emerging and rapidly
                    evolving field. Nevertheless, scholars have a hard time engaging critically with
                    one another’s work because they lack generally accepted shared language and
                    shared standards of evaluation and comparison. Moreover, without community
                    standards there is no foundation for the peer review or assessment of spatial
                    humanities applications. For these reasons, developing theory and common
                    methodology for the spatial humanities is not simply an intellectual exercise;
                    rather it is essential for the maturation of the field. The remainder of this
                    section proposes criteria for such standards. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Mostern has already written an article that reflects earlier stages of her
                    thinking about this matter. Her 2010 article "Putting the
                        World in World History" was an initial effort to articulate a
                    theoretical grounding for the spatial humanities, specifically with reference to
                    her field of world history, and particularly in the context of pedagogy.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e178">[4]</a>
                    That article was inspired by the work of geographer Doreen Massey. While Massey
                    is not a historian, the question with which she opens her book <cite class="title italic">For Space</cite> is fundamental to the field: "What might it mean… to question [the] habit of thinking of
                        space as a surface? If, instead, we conceive of a meeting up of histories,
                        what happens to our implicit imagination of time and space?"[<a class="ref" href="#massey2005">Massey 2005</a>, 4]. Using Massey’s work to insist that the
                    relationship between history and geography is more than the sum of "time"
                    plus "space," Mostern argued that practicing critical and temporally minded
                    geography means describing, mapping, and analyzing the spatial intersection of
                    multiple narratives rather than simply producing singular histories of change
                    over time; in particular by investigating the ways in which such intersecting
                    historical events and processes create space and place. Mostern’s article
                    concludes that studying the geography of connections among peoples – whether
                    structurally á la world-systems theory, or empirically á la world history –
                    offers a way for historians to develop a more theoretically informed and
                    analytically agile spatial humanities practice. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">The current article is still not intended to articulate a complete theoretical
                    foundation for spatial history, but it proposes four propositions that can
                    support digital spatial visualization and analysis, permit the framing and

                    counterintuitive that the next two sections of it concern pedagogy. However,
                    given the nascent state of scholarly review for spatial history, at present
                    there are effectively no professional platforms for reviewing digital atlases.
                    By contrast, any instructor with training in the field and the opportunity to
                    design an appropriate course can assign students to create such works and
                    complete them in the course of an academic term. Moreover, good teaching and
                    fair grading compels instructors to precisely dictate the components of the
                    atlas and the standards for its successful accomplishment. For these reasons,
                    the classroom is an ideal location for learning to specify genre characteristics
                    and review criteria. It is true that scholarly critique is a different task from
                    grading and that analogous scholarly works differ from one another more than
                    student projects do. We will discuss these matters in the last section of the
                    paper. Nevertheless, we contend that it is precisely the controlled atmosphere
                    of a classroom that makes it a good place to begin the neglected practice of
                    describing digital atlases as a genre, determining whether individual exemplars
                    are consistent with the aims of spatial history, and comparing them to one
                    another. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Following from our emphasis on improved intellectual grounding for spatial
                    history, our first proposal is that a historian teaching spatial approaches to
                    the past should teach history, albeit with an understanding of disciplinary
                    geography and interdisciplinary approaches to spatial theory adequate for
                    introducing relevant concepts and methods. There has recently been extensive
                    advocacy for the notion of cross-disciplinary "spatial literacy" or
                        "spatial thinking" as a goal in its own right. However, spatial
                    reasoning in support of spatial history is only a specialized portion of the
                    domain of spatial reasoning. Indeed, in its focus on historical processes and
                    human agency in landscape formation and transformation, spatial history is at
                    the margins of the spatial literacy field as it has been articulated to
                    date.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">The notion of spatial literacy embraces some modes of thought and practice that
                    are not at all relevant to the issues raised in the first section of this paper.
                    According to an influential 2006 National Research Council report entitled
                        <cite class="title italic">Learning to Think Spatially: GIS as a Support System in
                        the K-12 Curriculum</cite>, spatial thinking can be equally applied to
                    spaces both abstract and concrete: life spaces, physical spaces, and
                    intellectual spaces. Its disciplinary heritage emerges from math as much as
                    geography. It includes thinking <em class="emph">in</em> space, or proxemics, which
                    measures the kind of reasoning that allows people to efficiently load a truck,
                    find their way, or park a car. These skills are not relevant to the spatial
                    humanities, though they may be the kinds of competencies that the authors allude
                    to in terms the relevance of spatial thinking to cognition and life skills.
                    However, spatial thinking also involves thinking <em class="emph">about</em> space, which
                    is the primary objective of the spatial humanities as well as many other
                    academic domains, and thinking <em class="emph">with</em> space, or working with maps and
                    spatial data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e288">[8]</a> Initially, one goal of the Silk Road class was to improve
                    spatial literacy among history students, following the National Research Council
                    recommendation that spatial literacy does not belong under the ownership of
                    geography departments, but should be instructed throughout the curriculum <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#council2006">#council2006</a></span>. It is reasonable to believe that, similar to such
                    established interdisciplinary fields of instruction as writing, critical
                    thinking, or quantitative reasoning, spatial literacy is mastered through
                    courses both within and beyond a discipline. Nevertheless, students most
                    effectively and meaningfully filter these kinds of learning experiences through
                    the conventions of a given discipline, as noted by a longitudinal study of
                    undergraduate learning at the University of Washington [<a class="ref" href="#beyer2007">Beyer 2007</a>]. The lead author of this study, Catharine Beyer, suggests that instructors
                    need to think about improving student attainment of broad, interdisciplinary
                    learning outcomes in the context of majors and disciplines. By analogy with
                    professional spatial history practice, historians who design atlases should be
                    articulating how they are relevant to their fields. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">However, the National Research Council report also notes that it is still not
                    clear how to incorporate spatial thinking into existing curricula or how to
                    measure student proficiency in spatial reasoning outside of disciplinary
                    settings. Indeed, most spatial literacy and spatial thinking websites do not
                    promote curricula, learning outcomes, or assessment criteria. One representative
                    initiative, Spatial@UCSB, has developed a website that includes a page of
                    Learning Resources, prominently featuring a list of "spatial
                        concepts as the driving force for spatial thinking."<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e300">[9]</a> However, it does not detail any objectives
                    that would represent the attainment of spatial literacy, or suggest any
                    instruments that would indicate whether students are becoming spatially literate
                    or not.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e312">[10]</a> This critique
                    reinforces the need for teaching spatial thinking in disciplinary context and
                    for designing criteria targeted to given disciplines. Outside the classroom it
                    points toward our proposal to define an intellectual agenda for spatial history
                    and to evaluate the technical accomplishments of its works in its context.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">In the end, because of the conceptual breadth of the field, the difficulty of
                    gauging student success in it, and the marginality of historical analysis to the
                    geography mainstream, we came to criticize teaching or evaluating spatial
                    reasoning <span class="foreign i">per se</span> as a spatial history objective.
                    Nevertheless, there are specific concepts associated with spatial literacy,
                    primarily drawn from disciplinary geography, that can help undergird spatial
                    history practice. The Learning Spatially (LENS) initiative at University of
                    Redlands defines spatial thinking as "the ability to
                        visualize and interpret location, distance, direction, relationships,
                        movement and change through space." This competence overlaps with the
                    theoretical propositions that we introduced in the first section of this paper,
                    though it does not embrace the notions of landscape creation, transformation and
                    occupation that we consider fundamental to spatial history.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e326">[11]</a> Likewise, Spatial@UCSB offers a list

                    Nevertheless, this list does not conform to the spatial history conceptual
                    agenda, since it does not focus upon social processes and changing phenomena
                    over time, but rather emphasizes spatial geometry. For these reasons, we only
                    implicitly instructed the Silk Road students about spatial thinking. Since
                    competence in spatial reasoning for history is not the same thing as spatial
                    literacy considered as an autonomous field, it was not feasible or desirable to
                    design assignments and assessments for evaluating history students’ proficiency
                    in these areas. Likewise, the quality of spatial thinking in spatial history
                    scholarship should be reviewed according to its contribution to history.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">IV.

                    history approach focusing on the production and reproduction of landscape, the
                    geo-semantics of travel, and the notion of scale. Owing to constraints of
                    climate and topography, the travel routes that constituted the Silk Road were
                    limited and discrete, and amenable to reasonably accurate mapping. On land, Silk
                    Road travelers traversed some of the world’s most arid and high-altitude
                    terrain. On sea, they were at the mercy of particular ocean currents, wind
                    patterns, and safe harbors. Therefore, although routes changed over time, Silk
                    Road geography is organized around particular mountain passes, desert oases,
                    entrepôt cities, and ocean ports. Silk Road travelers exchanged goods — from
                    pepper to porcelain to lapis lazuli — that were mined, harvested, or
                    manufactured in distinct locales. Many travelers — Marco Polo is the best known
                    — wrote narratives about their journeys or became the subjects of biographies.
                    It is possible to reconstruct and trace the routes of Greek generals, Tibetan

                    wrote ten-page research papers about their chosen narratives, and in addition,
                    they mined them for spatial information. They researched the contemporary
                    equivalents of historical names in order to create gazetteers of the places the
                    travelers visited, determined the travelers’ routes from place to place, and
                    wrote short descriptions of the travelers’ experiences at particularly
                    significant places. They created interactive maps that integrated all of this
                    material, including even thumb-tacking their term papers, which focused on the
                    geographic aspects of their travelers’ narratives, to their maps. At the end of
                    the semester, with the permission of the students and the assistance of the UC
                    Merced library, Mostern created a video showcasing their accomplishments and
                    depicting the features of the maps they created. It played on screens in the
                    library throughout the Fall 2010 semester, and is available on YouTube and on a

                    the History Engine collaborative database authoring tool at the University of
                    Richmond was another inspiration for the class. Ayers’ students use the History
                    Engine to integrate primary source interpretation and historical research to
                    create temporally and spatially referenced content. Like the digital atlas
                    assignment, teaching with History Engine is grounded in theory as well as
                    embodied practice. As he explains: "The episodes in the
                        History Engine embody the principles of practice theory. …The History Engine
                        shows that, at base, history is where singular events and larger patterns
                        intersect…The History Engine shows how pattern, structure, event, and change
                        are embodied at the local and personal level, in a collage of
                        moments"[<a class="ref" href="#bodenhamer2010">Bodenhamer 2010</a>, 8–9]. Just as we did in the Silk Road
                    class, Ayers used digital tools because they helped him teach historical
                    principles, not because he wished impart technical mastery for its own sake.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Support from the UC Merced Center for Research on Teaching Excellence (CRTE)’s
                        "Educating Future Faculty to Engage with a New
                        Demographic" grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Post
                    Secondary Education (FIPSE) allowed Elana Gainor to work as a graduate research
                    assistant embedded in the class to evaluate teaching materials, assess student
                    learning, and identify relevant literature about active learning and evaluation
                    in a spatial history classroom. During the semester, with assistance from CRTE
                    staff, Gainor designed and conducted two focus group interviews, one online
                    survey, and one written survey of the students enrolled in the class. The
                    surveys included open ended as well as scaled questions. The scaled questions
                    offered quantifiable data, and the open-ended questions provided insight
                    pertaining directly to the students’ thoughts and ideas. Gainor administered one
                    survey halfway through the course and one at the end. The first survey focused
                    upon students’ understanding of the learning outcomes of the class and their
                    general response to Google Earth. The second survey asked them to reflect on the
                    original survey questions once they had completed their projects. The
                    discussions in the focus groups were based upon the survey responses, but they
                    also gave students the opportunity to speak directly with Gainor and allowed her
                    to assess student progress. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">We used the survey and focus group results during the semester to make
                    adjustments to the class, especially when they indicated the need for further
                    instruction. That data is also the basis for the claims regarding the success of
                    the class that we will make in the next section of this paper. There were 18
                    students in the class: too small a sample to establish statistical significance.
                    Nevertheless, the survey data establishes a baseline to use as a benchmark for
                    future comparison, and it is qualitatively meaningful. Moreover, the act of
                    creating the survey allowed us to consider what information would best reveal
                    student learning and accomplishment. For that reason, the surveys were essential
                    for determining and testing review criteria.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Support from CRTE was critical to the success of the course in another respect as
                    well. At present, humanities instructors are inhibited from designing
                    assignments that utilize new technologies. One significant factor is that, as is
                    equally true in the profession at large, standards and rubrics for evaluating
                    student work in digital media have not kept pace with changes in technology.
                    Instructors cannot design digital assignments if they cannot determine how to
                    grade them, just as peer reviewers cannot assess their colleagues’ work. In
                    addition we worried about grading students on the basis of work submitted in a
                    medium that they had never used before. Since this was a history class, we did
                    not want to unduly penalize them for lack of aptitude with the tool if their
                    conceptual grasp of spatial history and Silk Road history were good. Few of them
                    had ever been graded on any history assignment other than papers and exams.
                    Moreover, even outside the classroom, although interactive digital maps are
                    widespread, no standards or guidelines have been developed for them, either for
                    students or for professionals. We knew that it would be particularly important
                    to design and communicate clear standards and expectations. In order to
                    accomplish that, we employed three approaches. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">First, we created short assignments, due throughout the semester, that led up to
                    the final digital map submission. The digital atlas project constituted 65% of
                    the semester’s grade, but it was assembled additively from multiple assignments,
                    none of which was individually worth more than 30% of the grade. In addition, we
                    developed and circulated very detailed lab slides and held extended office
                    hours, particularly before the final due date. Finally, and of most significance
                    for this article focused on review and assessment standards, we developed a
                    detailed rubric that listed the components of a digital map project, explained
                    our expectations about each component, and provided advice. Appendix 1 is the
                    rubric that we developed. Our objective in designing the rubric was to clearly
                    and comprehensively list the components that the atlases should contain and the
                    standards by which we would evaluate each component. Our intent was twofold.
                    First, that students should understand what they were being asked to accomplish:
                    what we meant by a digital atlas, and how we were measuring success. Second,
                    that each atlas should have a very similar structure so that in spite of the
                    complexity and novelty of the atlas format we would be able to compare students’
                    accomplishments in a fair and reasonably objective way. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">We opted against using a standard grid-based rubric. The atlases required an
                    unusual and paradoxical degree of both creativity and standardized structure. We
                    developed the rubric according to Bob Broad's guiding concept from <cite class="title italic">What We Really Value</cite>: moving students towards
                        "self-authorship" and supporting our ability to evaluate their "ability to collect, interpret, and analyze information and
                        reflect on [their] own belief[s] in order to form judgments"[<a class="ref" href="#broad2003">Broad 2003</a>, 3]. We wanted to ensure that the rubric
                    constrained the atlas structure without inhibiting creative accomplishment.
                    Thus, we structured the rubric as an outline that detailed the elements each
                    atlas had to include, set standards for each element, and explained how each
                    element would be evaluated. The rubric was like a journal’s style guide, in that
                    it allowed authors creativity and flexibility in content while imposing a
                    standardized format. In keeping with Broad’s concept of "dynamic criteria mapping"[<a class="ref" href="#broad2003">Broad 2003</a>, 41], we described exemplary accomplishment for
                    each element, but we did not develop a formula to match descending grades with
                    particular deficiencies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">The rubric had three categories that reflected the range of historical analysis,
                    spatial thinking, and technical accomplishment required to create a successful
                    digital atlas. As we will discuss in the final section of this paper, these
                    categories collectively represent the mission of a digital atlas in the
                    profession as well as the classroom. Digital atlases, like the pages of print
                    historical atlases, include significant written elements, which usually include
                    an overview as well as commentary about particular map elements. Print atlases
                    also rely on cartography to illuminate the theme of each atlas page. Finally,
                    the graphic and written elements of an atlas reinforce one another.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e455">[17]</a>Reflecting that analogy, the
                    categories of the rubric were Writing, Spatial Reasoning and Visualization, and
                    Storytelling and Integration. Each of those areas had subcategories, and each
                    subcategory detailed specific benchmarks. For instance, because place and
                    itinerary are so important in spatial history, the rubric explained that every
                    atlas was intended to include a gazetteer with at least 15 georeferenced
                    locations and descriptions of them, with locations connected by routes depicted
                    as lines. The cartography for every atlas needed to demonstrate a communicative
                    visual style (which we defined as clear and consistent iconography, objects
                    distinguished from one another by category, and a title and legend), incorporate
                    contextual information (such as the boundaries and extent of regimes, important
                    cities or ports near the traveler’s route, and overlaid maps), zoom and tilt
                    settings that controlled visibility in an appropriate way, and an animated tour
                    or flythrough. The rubric explicitly enumerated all of those facets. We
                    circulated a draft of the rubric to the students, then scheduled a lab session
                    to walk through the draft point by point, and we encouraged students to ask
                    questions for clarification and to offer feedback, which we incorporated into a
                    revised version. The process granted the students some ownership over the format
                    of the work they would submit. As the students embarked upon their atlas
                    designs, our vision and grading standards were clear to them – and to us as
                    well. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">All of the atlases were intended to illustrate a clear historical argument about
                    a single personage based upon one primary text, and to this end, the students
                    were required to finish a draft of their term papers prior to embarking on their
                    atlas designs. This helped to ensure that students were good historians first,
                    and that they were using spatial reasoning and digital tools in support of their
                    work as historians. The atlases themselves reflected core humanistic practices
                    of research and communication. The rubric and course goals could have been more
                    explicitly spatial, but they were not, because we were not teaching spatial
                    literacy as such. Rather we introduced spatial reasoning in the context of
                    spatial history. We advocate the same approach to evaluating the technical
                    aspect and the intellectual content of digital atlases in a professional
                    context.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">VI. Lessons Learned</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Both the quality of the work the students submitted and the experiences that they
                    shared through surveys and course evaluations reveal that they learned a great

                    development. Their growing competence in each of these areas reinforced their
                    capacities in the others, and their performance and satisfaction exceeded that
                    of students in other classes. However, as we will discuss in more detail below
                    and as other recent research on the topic affirms, they were not the "digital
                        natives" we had presumed before the semester began.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e469">[18]</a> We had

                    routine editing tasks, but the time students devoted to those tasks paid off in
                    the form of more sophisticated understanding of spatial and Silk Road history. </div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Student Learning</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">Student learning in the course exceeded our expectations.

                        coding. Half of the students exceeded our minimum standards for success and
                        earned A range grades. None received grades below C. By comparison, the

                        enrolled in one of Mostern’s upper division courses. Fewer than a third of
                        the students earned A range grades, and almost a quarter earned grades in

                        results presented above. The surveys reveal that almost 80% of the students
                        felt that they learned more about history in this course than in a standard
                        history course, though half of their class time was occupied by computer
                        labs. This is a noteworthy finding, since the class involved less assigned
                        reading and less time for discussion than a more orthodox class. A large
                        percentage of them also felt that they worked no harder than they would in
                        another history class, although we assigned more work, requiring more

                        need not be framed as a new kind of literacy. Rather, it may best be
                        characterized as an approach that engages with capacities that many students

                        instructed in a different class, most likely in geography rather than

                        consuming. We had not used any advanced Google Earth functions before the
                        semester began, but as people with backgrounds in spatial history and a high
                        comfort level with digital tools in general, we found the application
                        intuitive. The tutorials on the Google Earth website were particularly
                        helpful. However, the students did not all share our facility with the
                        software. In general, they did not demonstrate a "digital native"
                        advantage. Certain skills that we considered to be matters of basic user
                        technique were new to many of them: right-clicking to see properties (for PC
                        users); copying, cutting, pasting, and dragging objects efficiently, and
                        understanding file structures and file suffixes. They were most challenged
                        by interacting with code, which most of them had never done before, and some
                        of them found intimidating. They had to write simple HTML in order to format
                        Google Earth popup boxes, and they had to write simple KML to time-stamp
                        objects in Google Earth. It was difficult for some of them to understand
                        which editing platform and which commands governed which behavior in the
                        application. Some students were extraordinarily adept at some of these
                        tasks, and one was a former computer professional. However, the baseline of
                        computer knowledge and comfort for the class was low overall. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">In order to teach Google Earth labs that were targeted to their level, to the
                        discipline of history, and to the Silk Road in particular, Mostern spent
                        many hours developing slides that used Silk Road geography examples to
                        demonstrate step-by-step techniques for completing each of the tasks for
                        which we would later hold them responsible. She also scheduled extended
                        office hours near the atlas due date to tutor any student who needed
                        assistance, to troubleshoot their atlases, and to check for compatibility
                        problems as she downloaded the atlases onto her computer. Preparation and
                        grading took more time and more creative effort than a conventional course
                        would have, and this approach is best suited to a small, upper-division
                        course. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">There were also challenges inherent in the decision to use Google Earth, a
                        free but commercial tool that was not developed specifically for classroom
                        use, historical content, or publishing authored works. The choice between
                        community-built and commercial tools in humanities computing is a common
                        trade-off, and Google Earth – accessible, intuitive, feature-rich,
                        well-documented, and integrated with the whole Google ecosystem – had plenty
                        of advantages over any other viable option. Still, it was not ideal. The
                        template for exporting georeferenced content from a Google Docs spreadsheet
                        into Google Earth was difficult to use; and this made it hard to work with
                        gazetteers, which are an essential part of digital atlas infrastructure.
                        Moreover, Google Earth lacks a time-stamping interface, which is why
                        students needed to write a few lines of KML code in a text editor in order
                        to time-enable their data; and it lacks a GUI editor for pop-up boxes, which
                        is why they had to write HTML to create appealing placemark pop-ups that
                        included images and formatted text. It also lacks a publication layout mode,
                        so students had to handcraft legends and titles for their atlases outside of
                        Google Earth using image editing software, and import them as overlays.
                        While these procedures were not difficult, some students found them daunting
                        or confusing, and even for the most adept students, it was not ideal to be
                        required to manage and use so many tools. Finally, because Google Earth
                        Community, Google Earth’s public data repository, does not have a provision
                        for creating closed groups, there was no way for the students to share
                        content with one another short of making it public to the world. That would
                        have been an unreasonable and unethical requirement, so we asked students to
                        submit their digital map files using UC Merced’s course management system.
                        Although that was feasible, it meant that we were not able to fulfill one of
                        our original goals. We had hoped to permit students to compare their maps to
                        one another and to reason about their differences. For instance, if they had
                        been able to evaluate how different atlases located the "same" place at
                        somewhat different points on the map, it would have been a powerful lesson
                        in the spatial ambiguity of historical maps.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">The Silk Road class included instruction in multiple software tools and
                        applications, spatial thinking and visualization, computer wrangling, and a
                        relatively abstruse historical topic. It demanded that students complete a
                        research project that demonstrated their proficiency in all of those
                        domains, in spite of the fact that none of them had with experience with
                        more than a few of these areas at the beginning of the semester. Many
                        factors contributed to the success of the course. Among them, we
                        particularly credit our insistence upon clear standards for the digital
                        atlas. This permitted students to focus on communicating about spatial
                        history without having to invent unique digital formats. We are convinced
                        that the development of structures and criteria for digital atlases in the
                        profession would have a similar benefit for authors and developers in the
                        profession. For that reason, we turn next to review criteria in the digital
                        humanities.</div></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">VII: Evaluation and Review in the Digital Humanities</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">As we have argued, pedagogy is a useful point of entry for contemplating issues
                    of authorship and assessment that are significant throughout the digital
                    humanities and spatial history in particular. We taught the Silk Road course in
                    part to determine whether a digital atlas could be reviewed effectively as a
                    work of history. Student work may be simpler and more standardized then
                    professional work, but it need not differ categorically. A history student’s
                    research paper adheres to the same format as a journal article, and the student
                    author aspires to excellence according to the same criteria as the professional.
                    We believe that the same is true of digital atlases, and therefore that it is
                    reasonable to develop digital atlas style guides and evaluation criteria to

                        <cite class="title italic">Profession </cite>issue notes that although humanities
                    disciplines have acknowledged "to the point of
                        redundancy" the need for a system of reviewing digital scholarship
                    for publication and evaluating its practitioners for tenure and promotion,
                        "practical change has come more slowly," and
                        "while the work of digital humanists increasingly is
                        seen as indispensible, it also remains impenetrable to most of their
                        colleagues." Although digital humanists have largely persuaded
                    colleagues and professional organizations that digital scholarship needs to be
                    taken seriously, the field has not yet provided direction about how to evaluate
                    it. As Geoffrey Rockwell explains to <cite class="title italic">Inside Higher
                        Education</cite>, digital humanities scholarly review is neglected "not for lack of will, but of methodology."<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e648">[19]</a> In <cite class="title italic">Profession</cite>, Rockwell distinguishes
                    between digital research, which is an activity, and digital scholarship, which
                    is an outcome that can be shared <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#rockwell2011">#rockwell2011</a></span>. When
                    we asked the Silk Road students to produce term papers prior to embarking upon

                    was because we were teaching them to produce scholarship. That is also why we
                    designed learning outcomes that were specific to history rather than basing them
                    upon spatial literacy criteria.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">We developed the rubric for the Silk Road student atlases with the conviction
                    that the digital atlas was a coherent genre that reflected spatial history
                    theory as well as digital technique. Likewise, several <cite class="title italic">Profession </cite>authors explore the attributes and taxonomies of digital
                    works, recognizing that determining a set of features for authors to master and
                    for reviewers to evaluate is essential for review. For instance, Steve Anderson
                    and Tara McPherson specify the elements of multimedia scholarship: multiple
                    media, user interactivity, a networked or database structure, nonlinear
                    components, and "a heightened attention to aspects of
                        design, aesthetics, or form," along with infrastructure or systems
                    development when works require new capacity in those areas [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2011">Anderson and McPherson 2011</a>, 137]. Rockwell proposes a typology of digital
                    scholarly works. Some of them, like online journal articles, can be reviewed
                    using established procedures, while others, like blogs, may not be amenable to
                    review at all. Some contributions, including tools and software, scholarly
                    editions, and multimedia works, are creative works that require new methods for
                    appraising scholarly significance <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#rockwell2011">#rockwell2011</a></span>. Jerome McGann
                    contends that "It’s important to remember that information
                        technology has not altered the fundamental mission of the humanities: to
                        preserve, investigate, and rethink our cultural inheritance"” [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann2011">McGann 2011</a>, 184]. The task of evaluation is to identify how
                    creative works in particular digital genres accomplish that goal. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">We concur with Anderson and McPherson and with Rockwell that multimedia works
                    have genres and identifiable conventions. A digital atlas has little in common
                    with a network visualization or a portal into a document collection – no more so
                    than a critical essay has in common with a short story or a library catalogue in
                    the print domain, for instance – except that all of the former were created
                    and/or disseminated using computer assisted methods. The review standards for
                    various types of work will differ considerably. So, as we did with the atlas, we
                    advocate that digital humanists identify genres within their own domain
                    expertise, distinguish them from one another, determine the suitability of
                    particular techniques for achieving specific scholarly goals, enumerate the
                    elements of successful accomplishment, and define standards that can be used to
                    evaluate each element. That is the work that the rubric performed in the Silk
                    Road classroom. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">We celebrate scholarly and creative work that crosses boundaries, undergoes

                    effectively, at least not until after we learn more about how to assess less
                    experimental accomplishments.<a class="noteRef" href="#d36852e680">[20]</a> In the meantime, many digital
                    humanities practitioners are completing works that meet existing criteria for
                    humanistic scholarship. They can be evaluated based on whether their content
                    contributes to humanistic colloquy. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">The introduction to the <cite class="title italic">Profession</cite> forum on digital
                    humanities evaluation notes that not all work in the digital humanities adheres
                    to established academic modes such as criticism and analysis. Thus some authors
                    advocate that we "shift our notions of humanities
                        scholarship away from a fixation on product and even publication"[<a class="ref" href="#anderson2011">Anderson and McPherson 2011</a>, 141], that we abandon "an
                        outmoded and sometimes patently incorrect vision of solitary
                        scholarship" in favor of implicit and ongoing peer review via
                    collaboration itself <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2011">#nowviskie2011</a></span> and that we
                    conduct review by assessing the community’s engagement with a work through
                    comments and hyperlinks rather than via anonymous evaluation by subject experts
                        <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#fitzpatrick2011">#fitzpatrick2011</a></span>. These recommendations for new practices in
                    the humanities are ingenious and bracing, and they may represent a possible
                    future. At the same time, as McGann says, "while digital
                        technology is introducing new critical methods and procedures, it does not
                        fundamentally alter the sociologies of scholarship and education or their
                        institutional mechanisms"[<a class="ref" href="#mcgann2011">McGann 2011</a>, 192]. Taking an experimental and open-ended
                    approach to digital humanities scholarship and review ensures that it cannot be
                    effectively ingested into actually existing academic institutions. As a
                    practical matter, that will keep digital work isolated, if not marginal. It is
                    problematic from an intellectual point of view as well. As long as we treat
                    digital works as if they are all idiosyncratic and incommensurable, we cannot
                    improve our practices, we cannot put our accomplishments in conversation with
                    one another, and we cannot use them to expand and enrich our understanding of
                    the world. In the end, we contend that while form is important to the digital
                    humanities, it should be assessed based upon its appropriateness to the content
                    and argument in a given field, and not simply its elegance or novelty. We
                    advocate assessing and critiquing digital works with respect to their
                    effectiveness for scholarly communication.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">VIII: From the Classroom to the Profession</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">At the beginning of this article, we proposed four propositions for enriching

                    creativity, while readers and reviewers can use them to judge and compare a wide
                    range of works and assess their contributions to the spatial history field. The
                    profession is a less constrained environment than the classroom. Nevertheless,
                    an academic field like spatial history is still a distinct milieu, and the
                    conventions that guide peer review are always quite specific. The review
                    standards we are proposing here are intended to be suitable for spatial history,
                    and not to all work in the digital humanities. The classroom experience is
                    relevant to evaluation criteria in the profession. This article explains how we
                    defined the intellectual terrain of a digital humanities field, created student
                    assignments specific to it, and used that experience to propose standards for
                    professional developers and reviewers. We urge specialists in other digital
                    humanities fields to do the same. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">In <cite class="title italic">Online Humanities Scholarship: The Shape of Things to
                        Come</cite>, historian Robert Darnton offers a rare and noteworthy critical
                    review of a digital atlas: <cite class="title italic">The Grub Street Project</cite>,
                    a depiction of the publishing world in eighteenth century London. Darnton
                    praises the project for its maps, its visuality, and its efforts to approach an
                    ideal of <span class="foreign i">histoire totale</span> through a spatial interface,
                    extensive context, and hyperlinked text. In its form, it is consistent with the
                    criteria we introduced above. However, he additionally interrogates its
                    contribution to history. In his view, the atlas comes up short by that standard,
                    for conceptually it does not go beyond a 1972 print article on the same topic
                        [<a class="ref" href="#darnton2010">Darnton 2010</a>]. Our point here is not to stake a claim about
                    the atlas in question, which concerns a topic about which we have no expertise.
                    It is rather to applaud Darnton’s insistence on asking humanistic questions
                    about it and not only praising its rich detail and technological accomplishment;
                    and to commend the editors of the volume in which the review was published for
                    soliciting a response to the digital atlas from a leading cultural historian who
                    is not a digital humanities practitioner. We reiterate, and we concur with
                    Darnton, that a digital atlas needs to be critiqued for its contribution to the
                    field of spatial history, and not only as a formal accomplishment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">In the end, we propose to hold digital atlases to existing standards for
                    humanistic scholarship and to emerging genre conventions. The classroom, an
                    ideal site for sustained, fair and actionable evaluation, can also serve as a
                    laboratory for the development of digital humanities standards. Although the
                    Silk Road atlases that the students produced are yeoman work, they exemplify a
                    space in the digital humanities for projects which are creative but
                    self-contained, and which use standard and tested technology. The <cite class="title italic">Profession</cite> contributors insist that digital humanists
                    need to educate outsiders to the field about our practices. We contend that we
                    have work to do internally that is even more important: to value – and to
                    evaluate – finished work that contributes to the disciplines.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Acknowledgements</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">This article is dedicated to the creative and hardworking students of the HIST

                        GIS, it refers to a methodological stance more than an engagement with
                        particular technologies. Judging by conference attendance and book and
