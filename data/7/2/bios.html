Jimmy Butts teaches writing to university students, but he likes to do it in strange, new ways.   He has worked with students in Charleston, at Winthrop University, at Clemson University, and most recently at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC.  He received his PhD from the transdisciplinary program known as Rhetorics, Communication, and Information Design at Clemson University.  His research interests include modern and postmodern composition strategies, new media, rhetorical criticism, defamiliarization, and writing pedagogy.  He has begun exploring in the kinds of writing that we will inevitably compose in various apocalyptic futures.  He has published multimodal work in <span class="italic">The KB Journal</span>, <span class="italic">Pre-Text</span>, as a proud instructor in <span class="italic">The Journal for Undergraduate Multimedia Projects</span>, <span class="italic">The Cybertext Yearbook</span>, and for <span class="italic">Pearson Education</span>.

Before her work at the University of Pittsburgh, she acquired an MA in Rhetoric and Composition from Auburn University, focusing on the future of invention in multimodal composing. She is wholly dedicated to the work of creative-critical method(s) and future(s),  reading poetry just as often as philosophy, and making or composing from and about digital, analog, and otherwise material objects. She is currently developing the foundation for a new materialist method for Rhetoric and Composition, which takes up local murder in Pittsburgh as its source in hopes of raising questions of narrative, knowledge-making, ontological entanglements, ethics and futurity.
