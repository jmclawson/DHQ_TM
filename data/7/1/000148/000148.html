                multi-generational story of a Dominican American family
                overshadowed by a brutal dictatorship and the challenges of

                including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book
                Critics Circle Award. Three years after its publication in 2008
                it remained at the top of Amazon's bestseller list for the
                    "Hispanic American Literature &amp; Fiction" category
                and is well on its way to central canonical status. The "galvanic" prose of <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite><a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e119">[1]</a>
                traverses "tropical magic realism, punk-rock
                    feminism, hip-hop machismo, post-postmodern pyrotechnics and
                    enough polymorphous multiculturalism to fill up an
                    Introduction to Cultural Studies syllabus," to quote
                two of the novel’s reviews from <cite class="title italic">The New
                    York Times</cite>, and it illuminates the rules of
                contemporary canonicity through the incandescent exceptions Díaz
                has carved out [<a class="ref" href="#scott2007">Scott 2007</a>][<a class="ref" href="#kakutani2007">Kakutani 2007</a>]. I will read Díaz’s transgressive
                blending of genre and linguistic registers as a "reverse
                    colonization" that calls into question the demarcations
                of American ethnicity as well as the racial politics of nerds (a
                term I define below). My argument uses Díaz as both an object of
                study and a paradigm for the potential of a hybrid digital
                humanities methodology. The complex cultural translation that
                Díaz asks his readers to perform creates a middle ground where
                Caribbean history, language politics and the class and ethnic
                tensions of immigration collide with the nerdy core of the
                mainstream American imagination. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">My methodology in pursuing these claims is to define a framework
                for "the literary" in contemporary American fiction by
                asking how books are contextualized and discussed not just among
                critics and scholars but also among a general readership online.
                Digital traces of book culture (by which I mean user reviews,
                ratings and the algorithmic trails that our browsing and
                purchasing actions leave online) allow us to make claims about
                relatively large groups of readers and consumers of books,
                creating opportunities for the ‘distant reading’ of literary
                fame, but without losing the specificity of individual texts and
                    authors.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e142">[2]</a> As we
                shall see, this approach attempts to find a middle ground
                between the trend for large scale, data-driven digital
                humanities research and the kinds of analysis more comfortable
                to traditional literary scholars. My research here incorporates
                book reviews from professional critics and everyday users of the
                websites Amazon and LibraryThing as well as automated
                recommendation networks operating on both of those sites. By
                considering these digital traces of reading through the
                conceptual frame of the network, this article explores literary
                culture as a process of contextualization and elevation. My
                approach draws from John Guillory’s work on cultural capital and
                his argument that the syllabus and the list are central to the
                process of canon-making [<a class="ref" href="#guillory1995">Guillory 1995</a>, 28–38]. The list, expanded into multiple dimensions, becomes the
                network. These new dimensions are visible articulations of
                taste: both book reviews and website recommendations make
                certain cultural assertions about the relationships between
                various texts and authors. By recasting these assertions as
                links and the names and titles as nodes, we can begin to see
                where books cluster and where they remain solitary. This is a
                way of studying the social forces influencing books and readers
                at their intersection with literary production itself, and it
                draws on related approaches that James English and Mark McGurl
                have pioneered in their work on contemporary literary culture,
                and more distantly from Bruno Latour and Pierre Bourdieu [<a class="ref" href="#bourdieu1993">Bourdieu 1993</a>][<a class="ref" href="#bourdieu1996">Bourdieu 1996</a>][<a class="ref" href="#bourdieu2007">Bourdieu 2007</a>][<a class="ref" href="#english2005">English 2005</a>][<a class="ref" href="#latour2005">Latour 2005</a>][<a class="ref" href="#mcgurl2009">McGurl 2009</a>]. In short, I propose a turn in the
                digital humanities to incorporate not just algorithms but
                algorithmic culture into our critical framework and to recognize
                that humans and machines are learning to read in new ways.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e163">[3]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Network analysis allows us to explore the middle ground between
                the individual text and the distant reading of thousands of
                texts, exploring the emerging space of cultural distinction for
                a particular author’s work at a particular time.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e171">[4]</a> It is this
                combination of specificity (in terms of time and authors) and
                generality (in the sense that hundreds or thousands of
                data-points might influence a particular configuration between
                books) that offers us a window into a changing system of
                literary prestige, a glimpse at the middle ground where readers
                and critics make their judgments within constrained horizons.
                Professional book reviewing and commercial consumption are two
                major intersections between the worlds of art and commerce,
                zones of exchange where popular canonicity and literary prestige
                are forged. As Pierre Bourdieu noted, "the
                    boundary has never been as blurred between the experimental
                    work and the <em class="emph">bestseller</em>," a truth that
                can hardly be better demonstrated than with the runaway
                commercial and critical success of Díaz’s <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#bourdieu1996">Bourdieu 1996</a>, 347]. The novel’s deliberate
                complication of genre and ethnic literary boundaries has led
                Díaz to an almost defiant acknowledgement of his mainstream
                success: "They’re so happy to claim me as
                    literature because it makes them all look better. They don’t
                    want to relegate me to areas of ethnic studies"[<a class="ref" href="#cespedes2000">Céspedes and Torres-Saillant 2000</a>, 905].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">This position has led scholarly reception of Díaz to its own
                complex multivalent space, with critics from the Latino/a,
                Caribbean, African Diaspora and Dominican literary traditions
                all interpreting his success (Díaz acknowledged each of these
                traditions in the interview quoted above). Daniel Bautista
                agrees that Díaz is "somewhere both inside
                    and outside of the ‘'mainstream,'’" writing
                fiction that defies a simple binary between ethnic studies and
                the mass market [<a class="ref" href="#bautista2009">Bautista 2009</a>, 89]. Indeed,
                Elena Machado Sáez suggests that "the
                    picture emerging from the criticism of <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite> is of a superheroic literary
                    text…that breaks through oppression to posit an ideally
                    marginal but resistant diasporic subject"[<a class="ref" href="#saez2011">Sáez 2011</a>, 525]. A reaction to this
                superheroic reading argues instead that the novel is a darker
                meditation on the violence inherent in narrative. For example,
                the text’s own charming but dictatorial narrator (Yunior, a
                version of a recurrent protagonist from Díaz’s earlier stories)
                serves as a troubling proxy for its primary narrative engine,
                the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic
                from the 1930s–1960s [<a class="ref" href="#hanna2010">Hanna 2010</a>]. Reading the
                novel as a "historiographic battle royale" clearly aimed at
                a United States reader, as Monica Hanna does, neatly
                encapsulates the challenges Díaz’s work poses to the established
                categories of genre<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e218">[5]</a> and comfortable
                patterns of reading. Its gripping style conceals a refusal to
                translate along multiple axes: the novel does not gloss its
                Spanish and Spanglish slang for that mainstream reader, nor does
                it contextualize its references to Caribbean literary figures
                like Edouard Glissant any more than it explicates its allusions
                to comic and fantasy characters like Darkseid or Sauron. This
                    "weird English," as Evelyn Nien-Ming Ch’ien calls it,
                demands that its readers bridge the gap, confronting the
                untranslatable and interpolating around it, grappling with
                Díaz’s rebellious idiom.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">By insisting on blending codes and discourses beyond Dominican
                and "standard" English, Díaz alienates himself from
                particular communities in the tradition of commercially
                successful postcolonial writers around the globe [<a class="ref" href="#brouillette2007">Brouillette 2007</a>, 60]. In applying the same
                technique to subcultures within the mainstream United States, he
                makes a subtler point about racial politics. As an immigrant,
                Díaz did not take solace in his identity as a Dominican
                American, since that identity was continually pressured by
                poverty and racial bias. Instead, he claims "what saved my life was being a nerd, watching all those bad
                    science fiction movies and reading cartoons"[<a class="ref" href="#chien2004">Ch’ien 2004</a>, 221]. Díaz doubly rejects
                normative behavior, embracing neither the standards of his own
                ethnic community nor those of mainstream American culture. This
                renunciation is standard nerd practice, but the staging is
                usually quite different. The nerd is a complex and shifting
                figure in contemporary culture with its roots in what Mary
                Bucholtz calls "hyperwhite" performance, including
                    "superstandard English" (like Oscar Wao with his
                    "flash words") and the rejection of "cool" culture
                    [<a class="ref" href="#bucholtz2001">Bucholtz 2001</a>, 86, 87][<a class="ref" href="#diaz2007">Díaz 2007</a>, 50]. I extend this frame to
                assert that the nerd is defined in relation not merely to
                    "superstandard" language but highly specific dialects —
                the mastery of technoscientific skills, obscure popular genres
                and, increasingly, a socially impermissible obsession with
                almost any arcane subject. For example wine nerds, XML nerds and
                comic book nerds are all likely to be among the readers of this
                article. In this sense, the nerd as I deploy the term here is an
                extreme version of the "fan" or "fanboy," a phrase
                Díaz also uses and to which I will return below.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">With Díaz as just one example, it is also important to note that
                the racial categorization of the nerd is becoming increasingly
                nuanced, with Michael Hanson defining the "Afrogeek"
                categories of "thug-nerds" and "rap-geeks"[<a class="ref" href="#hanson2007">Hanson 2007</a>]. Oscar’s status as an ambiguously
                dark-skinned Dominican completes his own hybrid role as a
                    "GhettoNerd"[<a class="ref" href="#diaz2007">Díaz 2007</a>, 32, 11]. In fact, as Ron Eglash
                notes, the figure of the nerd is not so much a bastion of white
                male elitism as it is a "potential paradox
                    that might allow greater amounts of gender and race
                    diversity into the potent locations of technoscience"
                because it is not racially but performatively white, or "implicitly white"[<a class="ref" href="#eglash2002">Eglash 2002</a>, 50, 60]. While the future of
                nerds may be defined more by Barack Obama than <cite class="title italic">The Simpsons</cite>’ Comic Book Guy,
                whiteness continues to function as a powerful stigma and
                defining attribute of the category, leading African American
                students who excel in science and technology to be accused of
                    "‘'acting white'’" even as
                it sustains a form of "hyperwhiteness" performed by nerds
                of all kinds [<a class="ref" href="#eglash2002">Eglash 2002</a>, 59]. Díaz’s choice
                to deploy the dialects of comic book nerds, science fiction
                nerds and others establishes a correspondence between ethnic
                boundaries and the deep, nerdy interior of the mainstream white
                imagination. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Allow me to develop this point through my own nerd
                self-affirmation as I discuss my methodology. The data I present
                here is drawn from literary culture "in the wild" —
                newspaper and magazine book reviews along with traces of digital
                consumption (consumer reviews and automated recommendations)
                from the websites Amazon and LibraryThing. Each of these sources
                links us to only a fraction of Díaz’s public readership, but
                they are communities of literary practice that illuminate how
                his stylistic project has played out in the mainstream. I will
                use two basic sets of data to build these empirical arguments.
                First, book reviews: I have collected and analyzed a set of
                professional reviews, author profiles and other literary press
                from nationally recognized newspapers and magazines, as well as
                a complementary database of consumer book reviews from
                    Amazon.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e308">[6]</a> I identify the proper nouns, particularly
                authors and texts that are mentioned together in these book
                reviews and create networks based on the number of times
                different terms co-occur in the same paragraph.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e345">[7]</a> Over the course of this research project I
                assembled a hand-tooled dictionary of proper nouns and used a
                Perl script to seek potential matches in individual documents
                from this corpus (repeating the process numerous times as I
                extended the dictionary). The script created a series of basic
                XML files with proper nouns tagged as nodes that I checked for
                errors before analyzing for co-occurrences using another set of
                Perl scripts that indexed those nodes by paragraph. I stored the
                resulting connections in a MySQL database and output
                co-occurrences in GraphML format for viewing with yEd, a network
                graph editor [<a class="ref" href="#yworks2011">yWorks GmbH 2011</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The result is a basic network of primary literary entities —

                in particular paragraphs of Díaz’s professional and consumer
                book reviews. As a brief example, if we were to apply this
                system to a one-sentence review that said "Díaz reminds me of Frank Herbert, but also of Julia
                    Alvarez," we would get the following:</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure01.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure01.png" alt="A Co-Occurrence Example"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>A Co-Occurrence Example</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">The co-occurrence links all three nodes in an equal,
                non-directional way. The method treats each paragraph as a
                    "bag of words" with no attention paid to syntax or
                nuance. Replacing the review above with the following would
                generate the same diagram: "Díaz is nothing like Frank Herbert
                    or Julia Alvarez." This may seem counterintuitive, but I
                posit that the fact of connection is at least as important as
                its tenor. As I have argued elsewhere, the canonizing influence
                of a reference or a list in a piece of criticism serves to put
                the books in question into the same context, even if the
                reference itself is negative [<a class="ref" href="#finn2011">Finn 2011</a>, 16].
                Another way of making this point is to consider the peculiar
                economy of the book review, a piece of publicly oriented
                secondary literature challenged with keeping the reader’s
                attention in a compressed format that is by definition a
                metanarrative. The set of major reviewing publications yielded
                22 articles on Díaz, with an average word length of 1,294. By
                contrast I collected 613 Amazon reviews, averaging just under
                166 words each. Reviewers deploy references with purpose in this
                context, and a negative comparison carries as much cultural
                weight for the reader as a positive one, establishing in both
                cases a contextual framework for the subject of the review. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">As the average lengths indicate, this economy is especially true
                for reviewers on Amazon, where the competition for literary
                attention is sharpened by multiple reviews of the same book and
                the status of the arbiter is always in question. My methodology
                compares these two fields of literary discourse through the
                framework of proper noun networks. Tracing these webs of
                allusion, reference and context allows us to explore both sides
                of that great literary event horizon, the purchasing of a book.
                While there are of course exceptions, people tend to read
                professional critics before they buy something, and they tend to
                write Amazon reviews afterwards. If book critics are
                    "gatekeepers" to the literary marketplace, readers on
                Amazon report back from beyond the turnstiles, telling us why
                they went through. Below we will see that as the balance of
                power between the two groups shifts, everyday readers are coming
                to define the "literary" in new ways.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The project’s second data set, recommendations, focuses on this
                literary exchange as a market: I have collected data from
                Amazon, the world’s largest bookseller, and LibraryThing, a
                leading "social reading" community site, regarding how
                consumers on Amazon associate books through their shopping
                patterns and readers on LibraryThing do the same by listing
                books together in their virtual libraries. Amazon and
                LibraryThing present this data in recommendations such as the
                    "Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought" mechanism
                on Amazon, providing an algorithmically driven feedback loop
                between accumulated acts of cultural distinction and specific
                kinds of literary desire. In this instance, I used Perl scripts
                to record an expanding web of recommendations on each site from
                a given start page (arbitrarily selected by me as the author in
                question’s most prestigious book). For Amazon, the script would
                start at <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite> and record the
                first ten<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e397">[9]</a>"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought" links, and
                then move on to record the first ten links on each of those
                pages, continuing to three levels of depth. The same process was
                repeated for LibraryThing based on the first ten "LibraryThing
                    recommendations." As a brief example of how these
                recommendations are diagrammed, consider this excerpt from
                Figure 4:</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure02.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure02.png" alt="A Recommendation Example"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>A Recommendation Example</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">In this data, the lines between nodes have directionality:
                browsers on the <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite> page will
                see a link pointing them towards <cite class="title italic">Kavalier
                    &amp; Clay</cite>. Likewise, those starting out on the
                Chabon page will see a link back to <cite class="title italic">Oscar
                    Wao</cite>. In this case, Amazon believes that readers of
                one book will enjoy the other, and the two texts end up mutually
                supporting each other in the larger system of
                recommendations.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">The mutual link is based, Amazon claims, primarily on purchase
                data: enough people who bought one book went on to purchase the
                other that Amazon codified the connection, hoping to entice
                further sales from users making a similar cultural calculus. The
                fact that this feedback loop is maintained, manipulated and
                studied by Amazon speaks both to our increasingly corporate
                cultural lives and to the importance of recognizing the
                contingency of data — all data. Amazon sells books and
                manipulates its recommendations in order to sell them more
                efficiently, so it is possible that the mutual connection above
                is shaped by other factors, such as marketing campaigns, but we
                can rest assured that the connection is productive, or it would
                be replaced by another, more productive one.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e424">[10]</a> That is to say that given Amazon’s dominance, we
                can assume it is reasonably deft at this particular cultural
                game: acting as an algorithmic mirror to its users’ literary
                desires, inflecting and reflecting taste through countless
                computations and statistical judgments.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">A full analysis of Amazon’s growing dominance in literary
                production, from author contracts to sales, is beyond the scope
                of this article, but I want to briefly sketch out its role and
                my reasons for studying it. At this stage the relevance of
                Amazon to mainstream literary life is hard to deny, if we give
                any credence to critics like John O’Brien, publisher of the
                Dalkey Archive Press, who believes "the
                    greatest threat to book publishing in the United States
                    right now is Amazon" (quoted in [<a class="ref" href="#white2011">White 2011</a>]). Whatever role Amazon plays in our
                readerly futures, its role in the present is to influence a huge
                number of acts of literary distinction, and to study these acts
                is to explore a core sample of mainstream American literary
                culture. And it is mainstream in all the ways Díaz inflected
                that term above: its users are better-educated, wealthier and
                less likely to be Hispanic than the U.S. Internet user average
                    [<a class="ref" href="#quantcast2011">Quantcast 2011</a>]. Reading Díaz through Amazon
                is to read him through a broad American public still rooted in a
                white mainstream, unveiling a cultural politics of authenticity
                and success that surfaces constantly in the data below. That
                contest of literacies is mirrored by my methodology’s contest
                for what Ted Striphas calls "algorithmic literacy"[<a class="ref" href="#striphas2011">Striphas 2011</a>]. Just as I am "reading"
                Amazon here, Amazon is "reading" its users and perfecting
                algorithms to perform that reading ever more efficiently and
                more closely.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">For his part, Díaz confronts the question of literacies with a
                culturally charged mixture of the familiar and the exotic (an
                effect that varies in specifics but not in nature depending on
                whether the reader identifies most readily as Latino/a or white,
                an English professor or a science fiction nerd), and my approach
                does something similar by challenging our notions of reading on
                several levels. "Reading," in this framework, is a
                fundamentally social action, bound up in collectively negotiated
                conceptions of language and inflected at every stage by the
                sociocultural influences that lead us to books and shape our
                thinking before, during and after our direct engagements with
                them. It is also, as I noted above, a form of collective
                interpretation that can be performed by Amazon’s servers as well
                as human beings. As more of our literary cultural actions, from
                browsing to discussion, migrate to screens and digital media,
                reading takes place increasingly online. "Readers," then,
                are the users visible through their aggregate choices in the
                methodology just described.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e457">[11]</a> It should
                also be noted that professional critics and Amazon reviewers are
                not necessarily distinct, though I have yet to encounter a
                professional critic who also voluntarily (or openly) reviews
                books on the site. But of course there are overlaps — this is a
                marketplace, and professional critics influence markets, just as
                markets influence critics — perhaps the most obvious being that
                many critics purchase books on Amazon. The middle ground
                perspective that I adopt here balances out the impact of such
                individual overlaps by looking at reviews and recommendations in
                aggregate, exploring the remarkable public literary spaces
                created by thousands of readers online.</div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Negocios: The Literary Marketplace</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Where established authors have clearly defined canonical

                    fluctuating position in networks of literary prestige as

                    literary marketplace is the most active and hotly contested
                    zone of cultural distinction, capturing both the influence
                    of other, less commercial forms of critical elevation (book
                    reviews, best books of the decade lists, etc.) and the
                    direct impact of school reading assignments. We can glimpse
                    these competing forces by contrasting Díaz’s presence in

                    and biographical affiliations, for example), Díaz is being
                    read here primarily in the context of the Pulitzer. I will
                    speculate (briefly) that we see the holiday shopping season
                    at work here and the release of major lists such as the
                        <cite class="title italic">New York Times</cite>"Best Books of the Year."<cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao </cite>spent far more time
                    on the bestseller lists in paperback than it did in
                    hardcover, and its status as a significant book of the
                    decade was clearly being cemented in editorial offices
                    around the country. The gift-giving season also signals
                    prime advertising, and publishers can allegedly "buy"
                    recommendations on Amazon just as they can rent display
                    cases and sales areas at brick and mortar stores [<a class="ref" href="#roychoudhuri2010">Roychoudhuri 2010</a>]. While reliable sales
                    numbers are elusive, the website NovelRank tracks Amazon’s
                    Sales Rank metric and traced a surge for <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>’s ranking from 2,652 on
                    November 29, 2010 to its best position of the year, 209 on

                    of 1 is assigned to the top-selling book on Amazon at any
                    given time, December and January were obviously very good
                    months for <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>, which
                    would correlate with a shift in Díaz’s recommendations
                    context. The feedback loop of advertising and consumer
                    desire plays a major role here, in this case highlighting
                    those texts with the prestigious gold stickers that embody
                    prize capital. Díaz is on a rare plane of the publishing
                    world at this moment, placed among books that are expected
                    to sell hundreds of thousands of copies. While we might draw
                    a number of these texts together around the rubric of
                    travelers and homelands, we can only encompass all of them
                    by calling them prize-winners, list-makers,

                    begun a shift into something else: another Pulitzer-winner,
                    Michael Chabon, appears in the network and the Caribbean
                    classics <cite class="title italic">Dreaming in Cuban</cite> and

                        Butterflies</cite> are linked in <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>’s first-order subnet (Figure 4).
                    These, along with the Spanish-language edition of <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>, clearly align Díaz with
                    a particular genre, once again placing him back in the
                    context of the list Amazon calls "Hispanic &amp; Latin American Fiction."
                    Nevertheless, he remains a literary gateway from this genre
                    of ethnic literature to a distinct canon of mainstream
                    prize-winners. Díaz’s academic audience also makes itself
                    known here with another critical text on migration issues
                    linked to <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>. These
                    shifting networks mark out the ways in which multiple
                    constituencies, responding to different elements of Díaz’s
                    fiction, vie for cultural dominance in contextualizing his
                    work. In Figure 4 these forces almost seem to be pulling
                        <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite> in different
                    directions, creating a more nuanced kind of prestige — an
                    effect that will be evident below as competing cultural
                    forces seek to interpret Díaz through reviews of his

                    him into a grander plane of the mainstream American canon,
                    first superseding the genre barrier to align him with Allen
                    Ginsberg and Robert Haas, and later linking him to
                    established major novelists Toni Morrison and Don DeLillo
                    (Figure 5, Figure 6). At the same time, he is, like Morrison
                    before him, helping to transform a loosely defined genre
                    into a clearly demarcated space of literary study. The
                    anthology <cite class="title italic">Latino Boom</cite> does not
                    excerpt Díaz directly, but Amazon claims it is frequently
                    bought together with both <cite class="title italic">Oscar
                        Wao</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Dreaming in
                        Cuban</cite>, and it is not difficult to imagine the
                    literature classes currently being taught around those three
                    texts. The simultaneous emergence of professional
                    anthologies and affiliation with established canonical
                    titans like Morrison and DeLillo also mark an inversion
                    point for Díaz where his work is no longer in need of
                    illustration and explanation, but can now be used to
                    reinterpret established canons. The transition marks the
                    moment where race and gender cease to operate as explicit
                    categorical functions (i.e. "Hispanic
                        &amp; Latin American Fiction") and instead become
                    implicit gravitational forces for a mainstream canon that
                    includes Morrison and Díaz but remains predominantly white
                    and male.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure05.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure05.png" alt="Amazon Recommendations, Díaz, Late January&#xA;                        2011"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 5. </div>Amazon Recommendations, Díaz, Late January

                    mainstream canonicity, we can get a clearer glimpse of the
                    enduring substructure of his fame when we limit our network
                    only to explore links that have persisted across several
                    monthly snapshots. Figure 7 offers a completely different
                    view of Díaz, identifying him as a peripheral member of a
                    Latin Caribbean literary community dominated by Cristina
                    García, Julia Alvarez, Sandra Cisneros and Esmeralda
                    Santiago. These sustained links mark Díaz squarely within an
                    ethnic tradition of writing inspired by the Dominican
                    Republic, Haiti and Puerto Rico. Just as striking is the
                    extent to which this particular sub-genre is represented on
                    Amazon by female authors. When Díaz is compared to other
                    writers of what booksellers might call "serious literary
                        fiction" the list is almost entirely male, but here
                    the market tells a different story, placing Díaz on the edge
                    of a subnet of immigration narratives penned by, and largely
                    about, women. Celebrated for his innovative style, his nerd
                    credentials and his esoteric references, Díaz is still
                    defined primarily by genre in the market.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">"Across and Back": Professional Reviewers</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">If the commercial status of Díaz’s work continues to shift
                    between the registers of big ambitious novels, Latin
                    American fiction, <cite class="title italic">New Yorker</cite>
                    elect and pop culture fandom, his various readerships
                    present him in a different light when the question of
                    context is no longer framed through book shopping. In the
                    network of authors and texts mentioned at least twice in
                    Díaz’s professional book reviews, the author of <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite> is contextualized
                    through multiple registers (Figure 8, with more frequently
                    linked notes at the top). When professional critics write
                    about Díaz, they unsurprisingly mention him in the same
                    paragraph as <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite> and
                        <cite class="title italic">Drown </cite>more often than any
                    other terms, and that shared presence is our unit of
                    measurement here. But the next most frequent co-occurrence
                    in the network is Rafael Trujillo, marking the significance
                    of <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>’s engagement with
                    Dominican history. Díaz would no doubt be pleased to learn
                    that the "Dictatingest Dictator" whose malevolence
                    overshadows his novel is also haunting his reviews very
                    effectively as critics situate <cite class="title italic">Oscar
                        Wao</cite> within a Caribbean context [<a class="ref" href="#diaz2007">Díaz 2007</a>, 80]. The larger network bears
                    out this point, freighted as it is with nodes like Tolkien
                    and <cite class="title italic">Dune</cite>. Critics often used
                    David Foster Wallace as an exemplar in discussing Díaz’s
                    footnotes, though in his own reviews Wallace tended to have
                    his complex arrangements of cultural references described
                    rather than explained [<a class="ref" href="#finn2011">Finn 2011</a>]. Yet here
                    Díaz’s footnotes and allusions are extensively unpacked by
                    reviewers introducing readers to this strange new beast, the
                    nerdy immigration narrative. Díaz himself is an author who
                    needs explaining before readers can be told about his work —
                    the Oscar Wilde node here reflects Díaz’s story, repeated by
                    several reviewers, about the mispronunciation of
                        "Wilde" in Spanish and the easy segue it offers for
                    describing the author’s transnational, bilingual work.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure08.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure08.png" alt="People and Books in Díaz Professional Review&#xA;                        Collocations, Ordered Vertically by Centrality"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 8. </div>People and Books in Díaz Professional Review

                    multicultural than it is merely a combination of English and
                    Spanish. The diversity of references indicates a lack of
                    consensus among professional reviewers. As a Dominican
                    American, Díaz falls easily into the Caribbean and Latin
                    American spaces of Derek Walcott, Gustavo Perez Firmat,
                    Francisco Goldman and Mario Vargas Llosa. As a writer
                    describing oppression and ethnic tension, his work aligns
                    with Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Morrison and Philip Roth. Yet
                    he is also firmly linked to popular culture, from Tolkien to
                    Stephen King, and many of the single-instance references not
                    shown here trace those connections, from Sauron and Mordor
                    to <cite class="title italic">Star Wars</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The Matrix</cite>. The presence of
                    Dickens in the diagram brings particular nuances to Díaz’s
                    role as a literary protestor and political activist. A
                    review of <cite class="title italic">Drown</cite> in the <cite class="title italic">Los Angeles Times</cite> suggests that it
                    is "artists who offer most of us the
                        only way across and back" between immigrant
                    hardships and the comfortable mainstream [<a class="ref" href="#eder1996">Eder 1996</a>]. Díaz’s almost lustful exposure of
                    a cultural underbelly is, it seems, just what we mainstream
                    American readers need — the challenges of immigration and
                    (with <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>) political
                    repression brought to life in fiction. And yet the authentic
                    experience, the "horrors below" that the review
                    describes as Díaz’s core subject, include not only colonial
                    and immigrant nightmares but the deep interior of the
                    American nerd imaginary — <cite class="title italic">Star
                        Trek</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The Lord of the
                        Rings</cite> and comic books celebrated primarily by a
                    subset of the white mainstream. Díaz’s work as a go-between
                    does not stop at providing the mainstream with news from the
                    subaltern underbelly of ‘"ethnic studies."’ This review
                    presages that element of critical reaction to <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite> which marveled at Díaz’s
                    particularly American cultural fluency — his comic book
                    knowledge, his literary references, his sitcom allusions —
                    which served to persistently yank the narrative out of
                    ethnic literature and into the cultural mainstream,
                    troubling both spheres to remind readers that these dramas
                    were playing out not in some stylized America but the same
                    landscape we inhabited already. In 2007 Díaz described his
                    intention to <blockquote><p>contaminate the real with
                        all this nerdy narrative, and then the same way just
                        doing the exact reverse — contaminating the nerdy with

                    professional critics, "real" readers respond to the
                    dark history at the heart of Díaz’s work, making Trujillo an
                    even more central node in the network than Díaz’s first
                    book, <cite class="title italic">Drown</cite>, and the centrality
                    of Trujillo in both networks speaks to the character’s
                    influence over reader reactions. By personifying history so
                    pointedly in Trujillo and adapting a distinctly American
                    cultural mythos to convey that history, Díaz not only earned
                    accolades but also achieved the rare accomplishment of
                    eliciting the same reaction across the board, from both
                    professional and non-professional readers. The Trujillo we
                    see at the center of this network is the "prototypical
                        Latin American caudillo" Díaz describes in his first
                    footnote for <cite class="title italic">Oscar </cite><cite class="title italic">Wao</cite>, establishing this
                    postmodern literary device as a vehicle for subaltern
                    history, rage and cultural reference all at once: "He was our Sauron, our Arawn, our
                        Darkseid, our Once and Future Dictator, a personaje so
                        outlandish, so perverse, so dreadful that not even a

                    rhetoric is hilarious and sad at the same time, presenting
                    the anger of the Dominican people in the slightly bemused
                    and jaded tone of a partisan scholar scoring points in, of

                    that many readers make, but Arawn and Darkseid, of <cite class="title italic">The Chronicles of Prydain</cite> and the
                    DC Comics universe, raise the stakes, signaling a level of
                    fandom and genre knowledge that leaves most readers behind
                    and imposing a surprising metanarrative on the metacomment

                    triangles, we can see Díaz’s game of cultural stacking as
                    readers uncover and interpret his layers of reference. The
                    central, expected triangle is between Díaz and his two
                    published books. But this core is mirrored and even
                    overshadowed by the triangle Trujillo forms with Díaz and
                        <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>: the dictator
                    actually overwhelms discussion of Díaz in the literary
                    context of his short stories in favor of the history of the
                    Dominican Republic. Yet this triangle, too, has its
                    reflection in the shape Tolkien makes with Díaz and
                    Trujillo, a cultural echo or inversion that manages to
                    humanize this alien history for American readers and
                    demonize its antagonist in one fell swoop. This narrative
                    doubling and redoubling, which appears so seamlessly in the
                    casual references Díaz works into his novel, becomes its own
                    source of challenging discussion as readers identify its
                    different narrative components. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">The racism inherent in Middle Earth is a metaphor Díaz does
                    not employ so much as he reverse colonizes it, suggesting
                    that the cherished fantasy series confronts the same dark
                    impulses that overshadow Dominican history and the lives of
                    immigrants in the United States today. Shadows and darkness
                    — these are the terms that Díaz seeks to trouble for us

                    Trujillo, that "portly, sadistic,

                    figure from the same troubled color zone as these imagined
                    enemies; the forces of evil we have so carefully illustrated
                    as unreal are still manifestations of real fears, hatreds
                    and bigotries [<a class="ref" href="#diaz2007">Díaz 2007</a>, 2, n1]. A whole
                    segment of the nerd demographic is drawn to Díaz through the
                    magic of that Tolkien triangle, recognizing him as one of
                    their own. One tongue-in-cheek writer suggests that Díaz has
                    given him the perfect snapshot of Dominican culture, with
                    injuries explained "in terms of hit
                        points — perfect for those of us who understand how

                    and transform die rolls and paper notes into an act of
                    collective imagination, Díaz calls on his readers to
                    reinterpret a literally "alien" story through uniquely
                    American touchstones, to use their well-developed faculties

                    footnote quoted above, by exploring another data set, one
                    that stands between the diffuse network of Amazon
                    purchase-driven recommendations and the highly intentional
                    acts of contextualization drawn from literary reviews. The
                    website LibraryThing encourages book collectors and
                    aficionados to join a "social reading" community by
                    sharing their libraries, book reviews, local literary events
                    and other reading activities. The gravitational center of
                    the site is the user library, where individuals can itemize,
                    categorize, rate and review their book collections. Each
                    work has its own page, much like on Amazon, but the
                    commercial undertone is largely replaced by a social one:
                    browsers can see which other users have read a particular
                    book or see what books others have recommended for those who
                    enjoyed a particular title.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e808">[16]</a> In
                    effect, this creates a voluntary, non-commercial,
                    user-generated analog to the purchase-driven recommendations
                    on Amazon. True to its social mission, LibraryThing also
                    allows other users to endorse or critique a particular
                    recommendation with a "thumbs up or thumbs down"
                    mechanism, allowing us to measure the strength of positive
                    and negative ties within this network of texts. When we
                    graph this recommendation network, the results are
                    dramatically different from Amazon, in part because of the
                    uneven results of such crowdsourcing.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30"> To begin with, this human hive-mind recommendation network
                    is less consistent than Amazon’s algorithms, which typically
                    churn out 80 or more recommendations for each text. Here,
                    the number varies, with <cite class="title italic">Oscar

                    average node in its three-level network garnering only 2.28.
                    In this sense, the network is already much more
                    representative of social position: instead of an artificial
                    ten out-links per node, an organic mesh emerges where edge
                    counts demonstrate a real form of popularity. In addition,
                    this network is much more stable, determined not by a
                    constantly fluctuating flow of sales transactions but a much
                    more permanent record of votes left by readers and endorsed

                    this case, the links are weighted according to the number of
                    votes each received from other users, so a link with four

                    Where Amazon’s recommendations are presumably influenced by
                    thousands of users and transactions, on LibraryThing only

                    LibraryThing’s basic structure as a collective database of
                    libraries and book notes, a space populated by literary
                    nerds with a penchant for cataloging and sharing their
                    collections. This is our clearest view of Díaz’s effective
                    mobilization of the subaltern nature of nerd culture, or
                    what Matt Hills calls the "‘'improper'’ identity" of a fan defined
                    by genre cultural artifacts [<a class="ref" href="#hills2002">Hills 2002</a>, xii]). The fan, or that more intense
                    instantiation, the nerd, functions as a cultural minority
                        <em class="emph">within </em>the American mainstream. The fan’s
                    engagements with texts move beyond consumption into the
                    realm of the creative, as Henry Jenkins argues. Building on
                    Pierre Levy’s concept of collective intelligence, Jenkins
                    sees communities like this LibraryThing network as "some of the most fully realized versions
                        of Levy's cosmopedia, expansive self-organizing groups
                        focused around the collective production, debate, and
                        circulation of meanings, interpretations, and fantasies
                        in response to various artifacts of contemporary popular
                        culture"[<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2002">Jenkins 2002</a>]. In light of Díaz’s novel,
                    these impulses also echo the Caribbean traditions Edouard
                    Glissant lays out of <span class="foreign i">métissage</span>, a mixing
                    and hybridity of peoples, languages and cultures, and
                    relation, a form of engaging the other that does not rely on
                    erasing or ignoring difference but accepting it as a kind of
                    sacred truth [<a class="ref" href="#glissant1997">Glissant 1997</a>, 47–62]. The
                    sacrament of the nerd is to embrace the weird and the
                    obscure in a celebration of those very distancing qualities.
                    But the LibraryThing nerd is still a figure deeply linked to
                    projections of whiteness who energetically pursues what
                    Glissant calls the Western impulse of filiation — ordering,
                    ranking and categorizing the universe and striving for
                    empirical mastery. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">The <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite> page, an attractor

                    filiation features that can tell us more about Díaz’s
                    interactions with these book nerds. In classic fan form,
                    users have filled out an extensive Wikipedia-like entry on

                    endorsement quotes on the book jacket, important places in
                    the text, et cetera. This level of detail goes beyond even
                    what Amazon’s deep pockets will finance for its book pages,
                    matching the definitions of collaborative fan cultures
                    identified by scholars like Jenkins and Jason Mittell [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2008">Jenkins 2008</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#mittell2009">Mittell 2009</a>].
                    These links echo the productive literary spirit of The

                    reader’s guide that offers translations, glosses and links
                    to further reading, much of it on Wikipedia [<a class="ref" href="#flournoy2008">Flournoy 2008</a>]. The Annotated Oscar Wao is
                    another complex collective reaction to Díaz, combining
                    elements of both relation and filiation in discussing and
                    glossing his work. In such interpretive spaces, Díaz’s
                    readers can respond to his nerd discourse in kind,
                    celebrating his writing as it references fan universes from

                        <cite class="title italic">The Fantastic Four</cite>. These
                    sustained engagements with his work demonstrate how
                    successfully Díaz drives real dialog with multiple
                    audiences, and this is the crucial pivot on which his game
                    of politicizing language turns.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure10.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000148/resources/images/figure10.png" alt="First-Order Recommendations for ,&#xA;                        LibraryThing"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 10. </div>First-Order Recommendations for <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>,

                    nerdy and other discourses into one vibrant creole, Díaz
                    successfully appeals to a broad American readership. But his
                    particular embrace of the nerd accomplishes another goal for
                    the mainstream reader, leading us to confront our own
                    investments in some cultures but not others. The nerd in the
                    guise of filiation, by pushing away non-canonical and
                    transgressive elements of his own cultural universe, defines
                    an extreme, interior superstructure of white popular
                    culture. It is the tribal narrative of the member who takes
                    his myths too seriously, who tries too hard and speaks too
                        carefully.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e1054">[17]</a> But Díaz
                    inverts this situation, pulling the figure of the nerd to
                    the outside, putting texts like <cite class="title italic">The
                        Lord of the Rings</cite> in direct conversation with
                    real cultural others. As a nerd, Oscar Wao is both part of
                    the U.S. mainstream and a symbol of the many ways it
                    reflects, traffics in and grapples with African American,
                    Caribbean and other cultural sources for the true power of
                    the alien and the fantastic. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">In refusing to translate Spanish or even italicize it in his
                    work, Díaz is only one of several bilingual writers

                        code-switching,<a class="noteRef" href="#d4078e1069">[18]</a> but he performs a
                    second kind of radicalism by engaging the parallel universe
                    of untranslated Elvish. Díaz sees this blurring of registers
                    as a real political act: "By forcing
                        Spanish back onto English, forcing it to deal with the
                        language it tried to exterminate in me, I've tried to
                        represent a mirror-image of that violence on the page.

                    them out instead of bracketing them or translating them.
                    Díaz even asserted his militancy on this issue with the
                    single most important advocate for his career, the <cite class="title italic">New Yorker, </cite>successfully lobbying

                    Amazon reviewer compared Díaz’s use of Spanish to Tolkien,
                    suggesting "it helps to create a mood, a

                    readers of <cite class="title italic">Drown</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Oscar Wao</cite>, brought to confront the
                    fissures between notions of America and immigrant
                    communities and within the idea of America itself. The
                    multiplicity of Díaz’s prose, his deliberate polyvocalism,
                    defies conventional ideals of assimilation by demonstrating
                    just how fragile our notion of the mainstream is, how easily
                    Oscar can complicate the "hyperwhite" figure of the
                    nerd by becoming a "ghettonerd." The psychological fuel
                    that powers this narrative engine for many readers is the
                    story of Díaz himself, an original ghettonerd, who began
                    crafting his writing as a response to the ways in which
                    other immigrant writers catered to mainstream expectations
                    about their lives. Sitting on a writing panel, he realized
                    that his colleagues "were putting on
                        this mask to try to hide the nerd….The great silence on

                        writers, going to elite graduate schools, going to elite
                        schools — that was the huge silence"[<a class="ref" href="#chien2004">Ch’ien 2004</a>, 226]. Through his assault on
                    the mainstream, Díaz both refuses to translate and
                    aggressively contextualizes his work, turning the conflict
                    of authenticity from a silent battleground into a boisterous
                    network of relations. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">This narrative of Díaz the nerd, then, is ultimately a story
                    about reconfiguring reading, the tale of a violent assault
                    on English to carve out a new political space for language.
                    By asserting his membership in mutually contradictory
                    groups, Díaz has led us to spell out our own silent
                    boundaries and ask when untranslated Spanish is really not
                    the same as untranslated Elvish. One Amazon reviewer who
                    felt as unfamiliar with his nerd allusions as with his use
                    of Spanish wrote: "As a white,
                        middle-aged woman in mid-america [sic], the world of

                        thanks to Junot Diaz, I was able to travel there and be

                    generations carved out mainstream distinction by extracting
                    interior white cultural constructs like Latin verse or
                    classical music and excelling at them, Díaz claims nerdhood
                    as his own. It is an act of recontextualization, a deft game
                    of what Glissant would call relation, that depends on
                    fostering reading that embraces many cultural and national
                    languages. This is, I humbly submit, exactly what scholars
                    in the digital humanities are engaged in as we struggle to
                    speak in the languages of humanities departments, coding
                    schema and cultural relevance all at the same time. We, too,
                    are nerds seeking to change the rules of "reading."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Like Díaz, I seek to redefine reading by expanding the
                    contested territory: moving from books themselves to that
                    middle ground of reception and recommendation. This essay
                    includes close reading and cultural arguments as well as
                    empirical evidence, shuttling back and forth between
                    academic registers to make its claims. It approaches Díaz
                    through networks, but not vast and impersonal ones — they
                    are familiar, culturally localized core samples that still
                    carry idiosyncratic traces of individual critics and actors.
                    Even the recommendation networks on Amazon reflect the
                    organic engagement of humans and algorithms in feedback
                    loops, producing a far more surprising selection of texts
                    than we might expect from a bookstore or library’s shelving
                    system. In this sense I believe we need to expand
                        "close" reading by looking carefully at the full
                    context of a literary network at a particular point in time,
                    particularly the new dynamic influences of algorithms and
                    digital reading, and to mark that expansion with the term
                        "middle ground" as I have above. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">The payoff of this approach, then, is in the cultural and
                    literary work that the networks allow me to perform, the
                    argument about the complicated "otherness" of nerds
                    that builds in the previous two sections. I take my stand in
                    the middle ground between purely data-driven research, close
                    reading and cultural critique: a definition of the literary
                    in the digital humanities that strives for relation as well
                    as filiation. After all, it’s in the middle ground where
                    culture takes place, particularly online — where our e-books
                    might come with highlights from an invisible reading
                    collective, where our authors tweet alongside us, where the
                    game of fame has many more players and many more goals. As
                    the digital humanities continues to define its position in
                    humanistic study, I think one of the best arguments we can
                    make is for our own hybridity as "readers" of many
                    different languages, including software, algorithms and
                    other digital media. If you accepted my opening claim that
                    reading is a social enterprise, you should also accept that
                    technology — the digital — is as well, and that the best
                    digital humanities approaches embrace the social and
                    cultural criticism lurking within our tools and programs.
                    It’s not enough to recognize how algorithms read us — we
                    need to learn how to read them. As Díaz has so elegantly
                    demonstrated, the literary is one more collaborative
                    network, and it’s time to get everyone thinking about who
                    and what we include in the conversation. </div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d4078e119"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span> Hereafter, an abbreviation for <cite class="title italic">The

                            is relatively ‘'sophisticated'’ or
                                ‘'complex'’ and often anti-realist; it is

                            name with a diacritical "í," as he has in both
                            of his books. However his name has experienced a
                            typographical evolution over the course of his
                            literary career as publications struggle with his
                            typographical "foreign accent." The <cite class="title italic">New York Times</cite>"Times Topic" page for
                                "Junot Diaz" continued to have it both ways
                            as late as April 2011, with the Americanized title
                            belied by book reviews with the name spelled
                            correctly. Database copies of newspaper reviews
                            reveal a number of character encoding issues, often
                            replacing the "í" with an error character
                            similar to "□," though most databases recognize
                            both "Diaz" and "Díaz" as potential
                            matches for Junot Díaz. This is not to argue that
                            such errors are intentional, but rather that the
                            failure to reproduce non-English diacritical
                            markings, particularly í, is a sign of telling
                            neglect by U.S. media. Díaz’s choice to emphasize
                            this aspect of his identity is part of a larger
                            effort to integrate these markings of cultural
                            difference into the typographical mainstream.<br/><br/>The story of the "í" is also a technological
