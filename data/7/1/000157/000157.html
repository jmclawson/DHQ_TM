Although the tool can be applied to any border, the chief border it has been tied to and tested on is the US-Mexico border. The EDT present the project as an artistic disruption of the tired national political theater staged at that border.  The piece refocuses attention on the basic human needs of those caught in the middle of the stale and stalemated divide.  For the EDT, every part of the piece participates in this disruption not merely the finished app or the poetry but the code as well.  In this paper, I ask, what would it mean for the code to poetic disruption?  One set of poetry for the project created by Amy Sara Carroll offers instructions for desert survival.  By presenting instructions as poems, she offers one entre into reading the source code of the app as poetry.  Using the methods of Critical Code Studies, I read the code of TBT in light of and as part of the poetic intervention of this complex performance.</p></div><div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p class="ptext">The desert is an ecosystem with a logic of sustainability, of orientation, unique unto itself. For example, if the barrel cactus — known otherwise as the compass cactus — stockpiles moisture; it also affords direction. As clear as an arrow or a constellation, it leans south. Orient yourself by this mainstay or by flowering desert plants that, growing toward the sun, face south in the Northern Hemisphere. (Amy Sara Carroll;

"Transborder" could (and does) refer to any border: political or otherwise. Yet the use of "border" and "immigrant" in a project emanating from just north of the US-Mexico border, unmistakably signals engagement with incendiary border politics that demonize the undocumented as "illegals," as an incursion of dangerous, job-stealing invaders. This artwork inverts that narrative by marshalling empathy for the border-crosser who has already passed into the United States but who is about to die of thirst. Its tactic: drawing the audience into a ritualistic enactment of that perilous journey. However, by presenting the journey, the work does not aestheticize the undocumented as avatars for first-world observers, but instead, by reframing the journey in life-or-death terms, helps to deny the rhetorical construction of "illegals," by recasting the travelers as immigrants in search of the most human needs: water for their bodies and poetry for their souls. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The Transborder Immigrant Tool is a mobile phone application being developed by the Electronic Disturbance Theater in residence at UC San Diego as the b.a.n.g. (bits, atoms, neurons, genes) lab. When deployed, the application, or app, will help a traveler crossing the desert to the north of the US-Mexico border, presumably on foot, to find water by means of a simple compass navigation device, aural, and haptic cues. Once the device finds a water cache nearby, the tool begins its wayfinding process, leading the traveler, likely dehydrated and disoriented, to the nearby cache. These caches have been placed in the desert by volunteer organizations, specifically Water Stations, Inc. and Border Angels, humanitarian organizations that work to fill brightly-painted barrels, labeled "agua," with gallon jugs of water, organizations that draw volunteers from the right and left of the political spectrum in America [<a class="ref" href="#stalbaum">Stalbaum nd</a>]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The app uses GPS information from an inexpensive Motorola phone to find the traveler’s location. Although this tool will not provide sustenance for an entire trip across the border, it does attempt to aid the traveler in what its developers refer to as the "last mile" of the journey.<a class="noteRef" href="#d28669e164">[3]</a>  The traveler activates the phone in their moment of extreme dehydration, since the phone has only approximately an hour’s worth of battery charge, and after locating its position, the phone searches for nearby water caches. It is important to note that as of the writing of this essay, the TBT has not been used by undocumented immigrants dying in the desert but instead has been tested by the EDT team and has been implemented rhetorically by fans and foes alike, for whom the mere mention of the Tool stirs strong emotions. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The Transborder Immigrant Tool is not made of hyperbole and political caricatures but instead, as the epigraphs demonstrate, a series of instructions and procedures written in a calmer tone, that nonetheless draw the reader into imagined journeys. In the first epigraph, Amy Sara Carroll so beautifully intertwines survival knowledge of the desert with evocative imagery of associations. This piece is one of several poems recorded to be heard by the travelers who use the tool. The second, found in the source code of the project,<a class="noteRef" href="#d28669e172">[4]</a> is a comment written by Jason Najarro as documentation of a problem in the code and an expression of his frustration navigating the desert of java. Rather than segregate these texts as art and supporting software, the Electronic Disturbance Theater present both code and audio layers as poetry. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Just as the poems help the traveler navigate the unforgiving climate of the desert, the complex terrain of the code requires a guide to navigate the dangerous landscape of the man-made methods and the interoperating systems of both hardware and software on which the code must operate. However, rather than merely draw an analogy between the comments and Carroll’s survival poems, I would like to examine the code itself as another channel of poetry and poetic intervention, not because it resembles the structures of traditional verse as is often the case in Perl Poetry or many instances of codework, or poetry that plays upon the semantic structures and conventions of code, but rather because the code represents a text of semantic signs which when performed (either through human or machine reading) intervene in culture by creating a poetic disruption. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The poetry in many ways teaches readers the aesthetic conditions under which the code is poetry. Both poetry and code present scripts of performed instructions which act as channels of artful communication, intervening in overdetermined narratives of undocumented immigrants. In this essay, I will situate the artful communication of the Tool as a folk ritual, which when enacted, conveys valued cultural knowledge. Whether in code or poetry, these instructions for an imagined journey are embedded with cultural imagery, resonant with customs of affiliated cultures, and address a set of possible stories, or use cases, about a traveler who is about to perish while crossing the desert.<a class="noteRef" href="#d28669e179">[5]</a>  To read the code, to trace its functioning as an imaginary border crosser is either sustained by water and poetry or perishes, is to engage with a counternarrative of the border that contradicts the popular rhetorics of pundits and politicians.</div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Part 1: The Poems</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The TBT project grew out of the unique ensemble that makes the Electronic Disturbance Theater. It began in 2007 as an extension of EDT-member Brett Stalbaum’s Walkingtoolsgpx API, a library of tools for use in art projects involving GPS-navigated walks, often in rural or even dangerous areas. UCSD professor, Ricardo Dominguez, proposed to his EDT collaborator that they consider applying these tools to the US-Mexico Border, and the Transborder Tools for Immigrants (as the project was originally called) was born, though not before the EDT applied for funding both to purchase phones and to develop a poetry component of the project to be written by EDT-member Amy Sara Carroll. As the project progressed, the collective developed all elements, including the poetry and code, in conversation with one another, according to Carroll [<a class="ref" href="#theater2011">The Electronic Disturbance Theater 2011</a>] The group began the development in earnest together with the other members of the EDT, Elle Mehrmand and micha cárdenas, and a  UCSD undergraduate, Jason Najarro, who over the summer of 2008 wrote the core code for the Tool together with Stalbaum. Even while in-development, the tool they have created has caused quite a disturbance.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Within a few months of the publication of articles about TBT in 2009 in Vice Magazine (Dunbar) and then the geek culture link site Boing Boing, the University of California received a letter from Congressman Duncan Hunter and two others. Hunter "found the project to be a poor use of taxpayer money, particularly doing a recession"[<a class="ref" href="#miller2010">Miller 2010</a>]. As Fox News gave the story national coverage, the University of California began an audit into the project as several other investigations began to pursue Dominguez. Between op-ed pieces and a featured spot on the Glenn Beck show, the project grew in infamy, even as the production of the project was delayed, provoking violent emotions even before the app had ever been used (Morlan). </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">The Transborder Immigrant Tool exemplifies Rita Raley’s concept of "tactical media,"<a class="noteRef" href="#d28669e200">[6]</a> whose "critical rationale" is "disturbance"[<a class="ref" href="#raley2009">Raley 2009</a>, 19]. She explains, "In its most expansive articulation, tactical media signifies the intervention and disruption of a dominant semiotic regime, the temporary creation of a situation in which signs, messages, and narratives are set into play and critical thinking becomes possible"[<a class="ref" href="#raley2009">Raley 2009</a>, 19]. In her book of that title, Raley posits tactical media as a response to "a shift in the nature of power, which has removed itself from the streets and become nomadic"[<a class="ref" href="#raley2009">Raley 2009</a>, 1], a notion derived from the Critical Art Ensemble, one of the major creative influences of EDT and of which Dominguez was a member. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Again, disruption is at the heart of these tactics. For example, by focusing the application not on the overcoded moment when the <em class="emph">illegal immigrant</em> crosses the border but on the moment the border crosser is dying in the desert, the project disrupts the contemporary neoliberal narratives about the border. As Raley explains about another EDT project, <blockquote><p>The aim is not to theorize liminality but to force a rupture in the binaries of interiority and exteriority, here and there, native and alien, friend and enemy. The radical dichotomies integral to the war on terror — "you’re either with us or against us" — find their counterpart in art practices that themselves depend on the solidarity of the "we" against the "them." A fence has been built, binaries constructed, and these artists intend to overturn them. [<a class="ref" href="#raley2009">Raley 2009</a>, 50].</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">This project overturns the border binary by rephrasing the question: "What should be done about those national subjects who cross illegally?" as "What should be done about those humans who have already crossed but are now about to die in the desert?" In this way, the Transborder Immigrant Tool essentially leaps over the border fence and thus escapes the pageant that plays politics with the poor as it resettles in the realm of life and death and humanitarian aid. However, the app not only can lead a person to water, it can also deliver aid in the form of poetry. Here is another disruptive tactic of the Transborder Immigrant Tool, breaking the categorization of the app as a mere tool of physical survival while it also disrupts an image of the border crosser as a laborer for whom poetry would be at best a distraction. The EDT’s message is clear: this Tool is an aesthetic object, resonating through artistic interventions even while providing for fundamental physical needs. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">The poetry for the app was written by Carroll, though other members of the Electronic Disturbance Theater have been contributing to the larger corpus of poetry which has been shared in other contexts, such as museum installations. Carroll describes the poetry as very different from her other work but suited to the occasion (email correspondence), describing her process of developing them after reading piles of survival guides and the migration account of Luis Alberto Urrea in <cite class="title italic">The Devil’s Highway</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#carroll2012">Carroll 2012</a>]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Carroll situates these poems within the larger context of "conceptual writing," as laid out by Craig Dworkin, Vanessa Place, and Robert Fitterman. Dworkin identified this genre, drawing upon the works of Kenneth Goldsmith, as "non-expressive poetry," akin to conceptual art, "in which the idea cannot be separated from the writing itself: in which the instance of writing is inextricably intertwined with the idea of Writing: the material practice of <span class="foreign i">écriture</span>"[<a class="ref" href="#dworkin1993">Dworkin 1993</a>]. However, Carroll notes that the piece moves away from the aesthetic-focus of North American conceptual writing toward theLatin American tradition, which embraces a more explicitly political mission.<a class="noteRef" href="#d28669e270">[7]</a>  A full review of conceptual writing is beyond the scope of this article. Suffice it to say, by gesturing toward conceptual writing, Carroll situates the poetic in a realm that moves beyond surface characteristics, where formal conceits and formalized procedures become central to how the writing is read – a genre in which writing process and computational algorithm become much more compatible bedfellows. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">That is not to say that Carroll has written code poems or codework. Carroll’s poetry engages with the aesthetics of instructions, of survival knowledge, derived from folk wisdom more than the episteme of scientific knowledge epitomized by the mobile phone that delivers the app. The poems themselves are individual meditations on some aspect of the desert, particularly the Anza-Borrego desert in San Diego County, as each poem combines imagery of the desert with tips on survival in that trying terrain. In the poem that serves as one of the epigraphs to this paper, for example, the reader, or more properly the listener, will encounter information about the barrel cactus, which suggest how it can be used both for physical sustenance and direction. Other poems offer advice on how to cope with and manage exposure to the sun, dehydration, and desert snakes, while conserving energy in the extreme heat. The nature of these poems reframes the tool with a larger tradition of ritualized folk knowledge.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">First, though situated as poetry, these passages offer practical instructions, survival guides, embellished with poetic flourish. Folklorist Tok Thompson offers the parallel of "leaves of three let it be" as a sign of the poetry of folk wisdom (Tok Thompson). Similarly, these poems convey knowledge of the land, its dangers, its hopeful sustenance, knowledge derived from the land, delivered in a deceptively plain-spoken style. These instructional poems thus evoke forms of artistry that transmit communal knowledge, like folk tales, aphorisms, memorable for their images and formulations, yet crucial for their practical information. They deliver poetic imagery with the aesthetic of instruction. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Reading the poetry as instructions with deep communal ties, or instructions that lead into the folk, situates the poems as the mirror image of the code, a set of instructions which also bear the deep imprint of cultural practice. Or rather, if the poetry seemed an unlikely place to find practical instruction, the code strikes many as an odd place to find culture. However, as the poetry takes up these practical formulations it outlines the nature of a kind of folklore, how the practical instructions bear the communal practice and wisdom. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Second, the poems are performed. They are read aloud (in multiple languages) through recordings on the phone. Although the text I quote in this paper has been copied from a digital text file shared with me by Carroll, those travelers who encounter the poems will hear them played through the phone at a random moment while using the Tool. The poems have been recorded by cárdenas , Merhmand, and others, and stored as wav files to be played on the mobile phones as part of a portion of a set of use cases. The poems that play to them are not part of a collection, an anthology, to be perused or thumbed through, but part of this process. That process is not merely accessible to the person who is dying in the desert but it is also accessible to anyone who traces their way through the code (or code repository) either using the machinery of the phone (or the software equivalent), or by reading through the code. The poetry then offers knowledge situated in a performance that is part of a process.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">But the poetry itself also suggests folk ritual, as it offers knowledge or advice that has been embroidered with rich semantic inflections. Consider again, the poem from the epigraph. The simplest version of its contents is "the barrel compass stores water and points south."  However, Carroll frames this information with the metaphor of "an ecosystem with a logic of sustainability, of orientation."  Of course, the phrase "logic…of orientation" speaks both to the poetry but also to the tool itself, which now by extension is grounded in the deeper nature of the desert. Evoking the basic compass wheel interface of the Tool itself, Carroll refers to the barrel cactus in its alternate name, "compass cactus."  Abruptly, the sentence switches its frame with the metaphor of "stockpiles," an industrial term more often used not in survival but in accumulations of destructive materials. And again, she shifts registers with "affords," a term with deep resonance in the realm of tool design, programming. The end of the poem entangles or emplaces the tips for survival knowledge into the larger realm of geography and contested borders, as the piece encourages the traveler to orient himself or herself by facing "south in the Northern Hemisphere," which at once evokes a sense of human divisions of the land in the context of a world view into which nation-states and what Dominguez calls "the aesthetic fiction of the border" dissolve [<a class="ref" href="#dislocative2010b">Dislocative 2010b</a>]. Carroll’s seemingly plain-spoken directions call forth the conflicts of world views, pulling on metaphors from production, war, and design, while re-orientating the reader toward land and country.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">It is perhaps only in the realm of science that we entertain a notion of cultural knowledge devoid of cultural dispositions.. Without rehearsing the entire epistemes of Foucault, it is worth noting that scientific knowledge is culturally situated and constructed and that the long shadow of world views colors or frames all descriptions of empirical phenomena. The genre of "directions" or "instructions" become emblematic of knowledge that has been systematized, seemingly stripped of unnecessary verbal trappings, especially when what is being described is a naturally occurring process. It is easy to conceive of computer source code in this context:  a series of instructions (although not everything is an instruction) devoid of cultural inflection, pure process.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Carroll’s poetic instruction in the Transborder Immigrant Tool, however, suggests ways in which instructions become more than mere directions. Her poems draw to the forefront the extent to which knowledge, even knowledge of survival, when communicated is, by necessity, situated in other kinds of cultural frames of reference – that knowledge is always cultural knowledge and instructions are always something more.

To read the code is to implement the code, to imagine the realization of that code, the software produced by it, and consequently the desert and the desert traveler as well as the water to which the software leads. To read the code is to enact the ritual of the code which carries with it communal knowledge and a communal history. Such an enactment is not meant to trivialize or aestheticize the real lives of those who could benefit from using the tool but instead to meditate not on their political representations but rather on their (potential) lived conditions by tracing through a procedure designed to rescue them.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Code is routinely conceptualized as abstracted procedure. However, for this paper, I am setting that conventional term aside for a more culturally situated formulation. "Procedure" calls to mind a series of steps aimed at a goal; "ritual" is a performance aimed at cultural connectivity, at instilling community, of signifying allegiance, of remembering. The code like the text of the oral performance is more of a transcript of a performance to be realized in the mind the mind of the reader or by the processes of the computer. It bears signs of its performance as well as its history. Which is not to say that code does not have an ends in mind. The Transborder Immigrant Tool does produce the app and govern the interactive experience of the app. I am focusing rather on the human reading of the code. Thus, I would argue that to engage with the Transborder Immigrant Tool through the code is to engage in a ritualistic imaginary performance of the software, a speculative deployment, an engagement that has many parallels with folk practice of ritual, song, and tale. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">The act of reading code then involves a willful attempt to process like the computer, to emulate the system that will be operated on by the performative, automatic, triggers of the code. The notion of literacy, therefore, in the sense of reading literacy, is insufficient for the act of reading code. As in processing textual symbols, reading code does require an understanding of the connotation of the instructions. However, connotation and electrical effects are not the same. Andrea diSessa in her book <cite class="title italic">Changing Minds</cite>: <cite class="title italic">Computers, Learning, and Literacy</cite>, offers the notion of "Material Intelligence" to substitute for literacy, meaning "intelligence achieved cooperatively with external materials"[<a class="ref" href="#disessa2001">diSessa 2011</a>, 5]. Because of the specifications of hardware and software, including operating systems, it is not enough to say that reading code requires the same kinds of knowledge of the interdependent corollaries and theorems as in the case of mathematics, though as diSessa notes these both require similar skills. Annette Vee offers the term proceduracy "for the literacy associated with computer programming, is the ability to break down complex processes into smaller procedures and express them explicitly enough to be read by a computer"[<a class="ref" href="#hunter2009">Hunter 2009</a>]. Reading code requires establishing an adequate representation of the state of the software (and at times the hardware) at any given time in the program. As I have mentioned elsewhere, this work can often function as a threshold paradigm that conflicts with the act of interpretation, which looks to connotation rather than this highly material form of denotation. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">To examine the code of this piece, I will use several of the methodologies of Critical Code Studies, an area of study I have been collaborating in since 2006.

It is a form of media-specific analysis that uses the source code as an entry point for discussion of technoculture. Code readings have examined databases, computer games, works of electronic literature, and even a program that is a single line of code long.

If the traveler stops, the Midlet plays a message to encourage the person to walk:</div><blockquote class="eg"><pre><tt>

</tt></pre></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">The moveWarningEnervator is meant to push on the immigrant who may have stopped from exhaustion or perhaps disorientation. The vibrations and the audio output were built around Najarro’s research into the state of a dehydrated person. Here is another occasion in the development of this project that demonstrates its primary focus on <em class="emph">serving </em>a real desperate human need, rather than merely representing that need. Reflecting on the mental state of the traveler, Najarro realized that their interface must be simple enough to communicate to a person about to pass out or worse [<a class="ref" href="#stalbaum">Stalbaum nd</a>]. Similarly, as the traveler nears the water station, the duration of the periodic vibration increase, just as a dowsing stick would respond to its approach of water in the ground.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">To read this code, by my measure, is to emulate the functioning of the code in a use-case. The reader must imagine the effects on the code of a water station found nearby or none found. In this way, that reading experience is likely to be multiple, but it cannot be vague. In other words, in order to process the code as the machine does, the reader cannot avoid the question of whether or not the traveler finds a water cache, but instead in each use-case must decide whether or not water is found and, consequently, whether the border crosser lives or dies. </div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head"><span class="hi bold">Poetry in Potential</span></h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p64">Just as the code presents the use-case as instructions suspended around potential states, so too does Carroll’s poetry. A second poem demonstrates this combination of instructional imperative, poetry, and potentiality: <blockquote><p>Heat cramps, relatively mild, signal dehydration and loss of sodium. <em class="emph">Drink water, rest in the shade; seek water at twilight</em>. Heat illness is an injury whose symptoms include fatigue, dizziness, fainting, nausea, vomiting. Redux: <em class="emph">Drink water, rest in the shade; seek water at twilight</em>. Heat exhaustion produces sweating, clammy skin, increased pulse and respiration rate, weakness, more fainting, nausea and vomiting. <em class="emph">STOP</em>. <em class="emph">The choices from now on you make will dictate whether you live or die. </em>Heatstroke happens when a person pushes on despite heat exhaustion. Trauma ensues — physical collapse, loss of consciousness, rapid pulse and respiration, a skyrocketing body temperature, severe disorientation, impaired motor skills, involuntary urination, dilated pupils. As heatstroke progresses, you will experience chest and arm pain, convulse, go into a coma. You will not be equipped to deal with these symptoms as they present themselves. <em class="emph">Call 9-1-1 or 0-6-6 beforehand</em>.</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">Similar to the code that handled the expired data, this poem offers the reader another pair of voices: one delivering data, medical information in a dry, calm tone, the other imperatives, whose italics underscore their urgency and alarm. The passage begins with the plain tone of a definition followed by instructions on how to combat. The symptoms list grows followed by a repetition of the instructions, "drink…rest…seek water a twilight," now a refrain. For those who encounter the art project, as opposed to those using the system to survive, the instructions are like the code: something that we read as intended for someone or something else to put into action. The second symptoms list is repeated but the pattern is interrupted by an alert: "Stop," followed by a much more stark warning. The symptoms list resumes with elaboration, embellished with images. Through anaphora, Carroll intensifies the impact of the "heat."  The final list marks symptoms the person will not be able to react to or recover from, followed by a command. This alternation of the symptoms and instructions act as alternating threads or subroutines, the one set to draw out the set of effects of hydration, the other instructions on what to do next. Yet they are not unrelated. The symptoms serve as signs to motivate the responses, like a series of if-then statements. They proceed with increasing severity on a path to dehydration even while they are instructing on how to respond to it. The instructions, the direct address, serve as the moveWarningEnervator, to push the perishing traveler to action.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66">The rhetoric of folk wisdom, whether in rituals or prophesies, delivers its instructions with conditions for execution and possible scenarios for outcomes, in ways analogous to the code. In cautionary stories and warning axioms, rules and rhymes, legends and prayers, folk wisdom travels through a set of admonitions that, like the code, carries with it the outcomes when its conditions are not met. The code and poetry of this piece deliver the wisdom of those survival procedures in tones that alternate between calm, methodological instructions and descriptions, on the one hand, and alarming alerts and pressing imperatives, on the other. The juxtaposition of those tones, as well as the interplay between the poetry and the code layers, the way they frame one another, disrupt any singular narrative of the transborder traveler’s experience, offering instead a journey that proceeds with urgency and yet inevitability, inevitability and yet possibility, leading either to death or to survival.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p67">67</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p67">At the same time, both the code and the poetry defuse the political Molotov cocktail of the border by situating the land not in the context of political boundaries but in a survival narrative. Though we have read the code as deployed by an imaginary undocumented immigrant, neither the poetry nor the code make mention of the traveler’s national identity, using  TB in the naming of files and methods throughout the code to inscribe "transborder" across the project in place of "undocumented" or "illegal."  The criminalization authored by the State is hence supplanted by the moniker of movement across a political fiction. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p68">68</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p68">Both the code and the poetry are part of rituals, part of this instantiation of the Transborder Immigrant Tool. They are performed in the execution of the Tool, but this execution has been mostly an imaginary activity. Most people who encounter this tool have not been dying in the desert. Rather, those who speak of the software and its applications engage in  speculative deployments. Some deploy the project only partially based on little more than the publicity videos or snippets of poetry, leading typically to reactionary responses. However, tracing carefully through the instructions in the code and the poetry, the reader has the opportunity to imagine the potential outcomes for the traveler and more fully consider the implications separate from the hysterical political rhetoric. Like traveling a labyrinth or walking the Stations of the Cross, pursuing the processes of the Transborder Immigrant Tool requires faithfully following set paths that others have and will continue to pursue as a form of meditation. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p69">69</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p69">To situate code as ritual is to acknowledge its place in the transmission and production of culture itself. In <cite class="title italic">Ethomimesis</cite>, anthropologist Robert Cantwell writes of the place of ritual in culture, arguing,  "Whatever the ontological status of culture as such, it must be embodied, enacted, performed, represented and reproduced in order to have any social reality"[<a class="ref" href="#cantwell1993">Cantwell 1993</a>]. The code and the poetry of the Transborder Immigrant Tool present a site of this performance, the enactment of culture through the lore of travelers who live or die while making their way through a desert that they must learn to read. In reading the code, we cross and cross back that same desert, guided by the wayfinding of the comments and advice, encountering and becoming a folk attentive not to the political spectacle of national border debates but to the potential loss of life and the conditions of sustenance for our fellow travelers</div></div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d28669e122"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>

                         In this section, I posit an example of reading the code by way of tracing out use cases. Admittedly, tracing out processes from start to finish is only one of an infinite array of reading practices regarding code. Most notably,  many, including the developers, encounter code through an integrated development environment (ide), which allows them to traverse the code with much greater alacrity, leaping from function to definition, moving through multiple files fluidly, et cetera. What I am narrating here is the process by which someone might trace out the functioning of the code from start to finish of the software, again, a kind of walking through the code.
