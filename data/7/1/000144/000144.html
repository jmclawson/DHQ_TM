Focusing on the recently-uncovered reprinting history of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story, "The Celestial Railroad", in the nineteenth-century press, the article demonstrates the central, shaping influence of religious readers and editors on Hawthorne’s early career. Cordell shows how the best traditional bibliography of Hawthorne’s works could be dramatically altered after only a few weeks’ work in digital archives of newspapers, magazines, and books, and using relatively simple search tools. Such tools not only expanded the number of known witnesses of the text, but also uncovered numerous paratexts: introductions to the story, articles reviewing or referring to the story, sermons derived from the story, etc. This "social text" of "The Celestial Railroad," Cordell argues, lay buried amidst millions of pages that accumulated in the nineteenth century and required modern tools to be uncovered. The article also discusses how digital interpretive tools can help make better sense of such enlarged bibliographies. By comparing multiple printings of "The Celestial Railroad" using the Juxta Collation tool from NINES, Cordell argues that textual fluidity can tell modern readers much about how texts were understood by their original publishers and readers. The many changes to and discussions of "The Celestial Railroad," for instance, indicate that the tale was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message, but nonetheless deployed as a weapon in denominational debates.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In 1847, editor Rufus Griswold published an extensive anthology of American prose, <cite class="title italic">The Prose Writers of America</cite>, a follow-up to his popular 1842 anthology of American poetry, <cite class="title italic">The Poets and Poetry of America</cite>. In both of these works, Griswold collects and introduces the works of more than seventy authors he believes will define "a National Literature that shall fulfil (sic) our  [the United States’] promise to mankind"[<a class="ref" href="#griswold1847">Griswold 1847</a>, 52]. In <cite class="title italic">Prose Writers</cite> Griswold calls Nathaniel Hawthorne’s writing "superior to all else of a similar description in the English language," while in a shorter preface to Hawthorne’s contributions Griswold ranks him "among the first of the first order of our writers…not excelled in the literature of the present day or of the English language"[<a class="ref" href="#griswold1847">Griswold 1847</a>, 33, 471]. Given the ambitious aims of his anthology, this is high praise indeed. However, Meredith McGill calls Griswold’s praise of Hawthorne "striking" because "Griswold’s selections are all what we would consider minor fiction"[<a class="ref" href="#mcgill2003">McGill 2003</a>, 327—328, n19]. Griswold ignores the stories that modern readers favor, such as "Young Goodman Brown"[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1835">Hawthorne 1835</a>], "The Minister’s Black Veil"[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1836">Hawthorne 1836</a>], or "Rappaccini’s Daughter"[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1844b">Hawthorne 1844b</a>]. Though these stories were available to him, Griswold instead reprints four Hawthorne stories that modern literary critics, teachers, and anthology editors mostly ignore: "A Rill from the Town Pump,""David Swan — A Fantasy,""Spring," and "The Celestial Railroad."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The mystery of Griswold’s selections, however, can now be at least partially explained due to the extensive record of texts and paratexts available in digital archives of nineteenth-century newspapers, periodicals, and books. Working with such archives — either through basic search or more complex text-mining techniques — can enable scholars to assemble textual histories more quickly and comprehensively than traditional archival research allows. More importantly, these textual histories can differ in character from traditional bibliographies by including primary literary texts, reprints, and also the paratexts that introduced, extended, amended, or critiqued them. In search results from digital archives, paratexts cluster with their parent texts, foregrounding the cultural conversations that shaped how readers encountered and interpreted literary works. <a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e176">[1]</a> In his work on twentieth- and twenty-first-century fiction, Ed Finn calls these conversations "the social lives of books." Finn mines online reviews and recommendations of David Foster Wallace from sites such as Amazon to find "traces of popular reading choices" which can "constitute a fresh perspective on elusive audience reactions to literature, one that reveals distinct networks of conversation that are transforming the relationships between writers and their readers"[<a class="ref" href="#finn2011">Finn 2011</a>, 1–2]. Digital archives of nineteenth-century texts expose similar "literary networks"<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e195">[2]</a> around short stories, poems, essays, and books, foregrounding questions of reception and cultural impact that traditional bibliographies can obscure.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Digging for one of Griswold’s <cite class="title italic">Prose Writers</cite> selections, Hawthorne’s "The Celestial Railroad," in a range of digital archives,<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e221">[3]</a> I have uncovered an extensive network of reprinting, reauthorship, and reference that can help explain Griswold’s selection of "The Celestial Railroad" for <cite class="title italic">Prose Writers</cite> in 1847 and illuminates the importance of digital methodologies for literary study. By the time of Griswold’s publication, "The Celestial Railroad" had appeared in newspapers and magazines across the country and made Hawthorne’s reputation for many readers. Griswold’s was only one in a series of reprintings that began days after the tale first appeared in the May 1843 issue of the <cite class="title italic">United States Magazine and Democratic Review</cite>. "The Celestial Railroad" was not a minor work, but rather a central text in the nineteenth-century evangelical canon, popular for its doctrinal orthodoxy and pithy moral instruction — both characteristics modern scholars rarely associate with Hawthorne, but which were central to his early reception in contemporary religious circles.<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e243">[4]</a> Indeed, the religious editors and readers — a particular social literary network — that embraced and shared Hawthorne’s early work helped shape readers’ reception of his later novels. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">"The Celestial Railroad" is a satirical re-imagination of John Bunyan’s <cite class="title italic">Pilgrim’s Progress </cite>in light of technological and theological "progress." The tale satirizes the easy, modern Christianity of the nineteenth century. Modern critics have mostly ignored this allegory as a quirky story unrepresentative of Hawthorne’s oeuvre. However, the larger cultural history of "The Celestial Railroad" — the social life of the tale — has been obscured to scholars until recently. The most thorough Hawthorne bibliography, C. E. Frazer Clark’s <cite class="title italic">Nathaniel Hawthorne: A Descriptive Bibliography</cite>, lists 22 reprintings of the story in pamphlets, magazines, and newspapers through the nineteenth century [<a class="ref" href="#clark1978">Clark 1978</a>]. Referencing Clark, Meredith McGill notes that "a comprehensive list of the reprinting of Hawthorne’s tales," would require "a bibliographic feat which is as yet impossible due to the inadequately indexed state of nineteenth-century periodicals"[<a class="ref" href="#mcgill2003">McGill 2003</a>, 327, n18]. While a <em class="emph">complete</em> bibliography of any story remains out of reach for the reason McGill names, recent projects to digitize nineteenth-century periodicals provide scholars with tools unavailable when Clark compiled his work. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">By mining a range of digital archives and non-digitized newspapers that digital editions referenced, I’ve uncovered more than 47 reprints of "The Celestial Railroad" during the nineteenth century, and several in the early decades of the twentieth — more than double the printings Clark lists in his bibliography.<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e283">[5]</a> I’ve also found several books and stories inspired by "The Celestial Railroad" and nearly 100 direct references to the characters, settings, and themes of Hawthorne’s tale in contemporary articles and books. These paratexts have proved particularly valuable, revealing a number of new insights about Hawthorne’s early career and his relationship to the popular press. In particular, this research has pointed toward a new understanding of Hawthorne’s reception by contemporary religious readers. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">In this article I will examine the editorial changes, introductions, and glosses that recast the message of "The Celestial Railroad" for different denominational audiences. I will argue that the religious press valued the story for its antisectarian moral and, simultaneously, as a shot across the bow of competing sects. Finally, by examining "The Celestial Railroad’s" history of reprinting and revision in the religious press, I hope to briefly suggest a new reading of Hawthorne’s famous frustration with "the pamphlet and piratical system" that he worried, in a letter to Horatio Bridge, forced him "to work hard for small gains" as a short story writer [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1987">Hawthorne 1987</a>, 27].  I hope to show that his feeling of being "taken possession of so unceremoniously," as his wife Sophia claimed in a letter to Louisa Hawthorne [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1987">Hawthorne 1987</a>, 28, n4], may have been grounded in disaffection with the sectarian squabbling that both motivated and sustained the tale’s life in the religious print market. Indeed, this disaffection may have prompted the one substantial edit Hawthorne made to the story between its initial magazine publication (1843) and its appearance in Hawthorne’s short-story collection, <cite class="title italic">Mosses from an Old Manse </cite>(1846)<cite class="title italic">.</cite></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Implications of "The Celestial Railroad" for Digital Literary Scholarship</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Alongside my arguments locating Hawthorne in the evangelical canon, I will discuss how digital archives of nineteenth-century texts enabled my discoveries about "The Celestial Railroad" and how digital interpretive tools helped me make better sense of the story’s enlarged bibliography. I hope by this discussion to suggest how these new technologies can inform future work in bibliography, periodical studies, and American literary history. As more of our cultural legacy is digitized, through thematic research collections and larger archives such as Google Books or HathiTrust, newly apparent historical and textual narratives promise to multiply exponentially. Not only will new witnesses of stories, poems, and essays surface, but so to will literary networks of reference, critique, and allusion that previously could have only been discovered through chance encounter or laborious scrutiny. The rewards of intensive, traditional bibliographic research may have seemed distant and speculative — a minute return for much labor. Mass digitization promises to reduce the time required for such research while allowing scholars to move between different scales of analysis, weighing the conclusions suggested by individual texts against those drawn through quantitative analysis of larger collections and archives — and, conversely, weighing conclusions drawn through distant analysis of archives against the telling details of individual texts. Rather than "close" or "distant" reading, we might call this "zoomable reading," in which one moves between levels of perspective to build a robust argument.<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e350">[6]</a> Zoomable reading is particularly suited for uncovering and making sense of the social textual networks that "The Celestial Railroad" exemplifies — both the nodes of individual texts (close) and the edges of intertextual conversations (distant).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Of course, claims of "more, better, faster" are unlikely to convince entrenched traditional literary scholars to experiment with digital modes of scholarship, which is why I devote the majority of this article to the humanistic payoffs of my digital research. The discoveries I enumerate here are theoretically quite traditional. Were I to remove references to my methodologies, this essay would outline a new historical account of Hawthorne’s early career drawn from a range of primary sources: contemporary books and periodicals. The witnesses and paratexts I have accumulated <em class="emph">could</em> have been amassed through trips to archives and interlibrary loan. In practice, however, this study emphasizes the great benefits of working in a digital scholarly mode. To build a bibliography like mine for "The Celestial Railroad" without digital book and periodical archives would require what McGann deems "unacceptable expenditures of time and labor"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2001">#mcgann2001</a></span>. Finding such a range of sources — including many obscure regional or denominational periodicals and many reprints uncited in any other publication — would have been the work of years rather than months.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Of course, the greater expansiveness of digital archives should not be confused with completeness. If anything, the paratexts one can uncover digitally can emphasize the partialness of enumerative bibliographies. As Susan Belasco points out, "anyone who thinks that most historical periodicals are available online would be surprised to learn how many periodicals — especially newspapers — have not been recovered in electronic papers"[<a class="ref" href="#belasco2011">Belasco 2011</a>, 50]. I’m certain that many more reprintings of "The Celestial Railroad" exist. Antebellum southern periodicals, for instance, are less thoroughly represented in online archives than northern and midwestern papers. Consequently, I’ve been unable to substantiate Moncure D. Conway’s 1882 claim that "'The Celestial Railway' (sic) was the first piece by Hawthorne that penetrated our Southern Region" when it was "copied in the newspapers of that region, and much enjoyed as a satire upon the rationalistic tendencies of the North"[<a class="ref" href="#conway1882">Conway 1882</a>, 260]. Conway specifies elsewhere that "[i]n 1848 the Richmond <cite class="title italic">Examiner</cite> brought into our house 'The Celestial Railroad,' by Nathaniel Hawthorne" — a claim I’ve been unable to verify due to sparse library holdings, digital or otherwise, of that newspaper for the 1840s [<a class="ref" href="#conway1902">Conway 1902</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e412">[7]</a> I’ve so far confirmed only one southern reprinting, in Louisville, Kentucky’s <cite class="title italic">Baptist Banner and Western Pioneer</cite>, who printed the tale in two parts on October 19 and 26, 1843 [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843i">Hawthorne 1843i</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e420">[8]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Moreover, the digital archival resources we have are far from perfect.  I could point, for instance, to Geoffrey Nunberg’s concerns about Google Books; to answer scholarly questions, Nunberg argues, scholars "need reliable metadata about dates and categories," but Google’s "metadata are a train wreck: a mish-mash wrapped in a muddle wrapped in a mess"[<a class="ref" href="#nunberg2009">Nunberg 2009</a>]. Metadata isn’t the only problem. The quality of OCR across the range of nineteenth-century textual archives is uneven, resulting in widely variable search results. "Dirty" OCR forces more creative search techniques from scholars mining archives for specific treasure, and scholars must be content knowing their results will be incomplete. Finally, scholars worry that so much of our cultural heritage sits restricted behind pay-walls, as are many of the most thorough archives of nineteenth-century periodicals [<a class="ref" href="#belasco2011">Belasco 2011</a>, 50].	</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">These are all concerns that digital humanities scholars must continue to voice. As Wesley Raabe contends, however, "an attitude of suspicion toward digital resources" can be as harmful as an attitude of blithe advocacy: "[a] digital text prepared by OCR means, which is inadequate for many purposes, is uniquely able to complement other methods of text acquisition"[<a class="ref" href="#raabe2011">Raabe 2011</a>, 78]. In the case of "The Celestial Railroad," OCR texts of widely variant quality have yielded significant treasure, especially when complemented by discoveries made through traditional archival research. It is worth noting, for instance, that I discovered those two Conway references to southern reprintings of "The Celestial Railroad" in Google Books. In other words, I wouldn’t know to be frustrated at the limited holdings of southern texts within digital archives had a digital archive not alerted me to the likelihood of southern printings of "The Celestial Railroad." That limited digital resources helped uncover such a rich story of our literary history should lead us to advocate for increased digitization of newspapers and magazines. As Belasco argues of Whitman, engaging with periodicals "provides fresh ways of understanding" antebellum authors’ "publication practices and enhances our understanding of nineteenth-century practices of reading and writing more generally"[<a class="ref" href="#belasco2011">Belasco 2011</a>, 44].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">It is especially fitting that digital technologies help uncover the life of a text in the mass media of the nineteenth century. As John A. Walsh points out in his contribution to <cite class="title italic">A Companion to Digital Literary Studies</cite>, the nineteenth century "holds a special attraction for digital literary scholarship" because its technical revolutions immediately generated our own, while the effects of those revolutions paralleled the effects of the digital age on society today. "Many features of the nineteenth century," he claims, "increased literacy rates, the beginnings of mass media, the decreasing costs of publishing — led to ever-increasing volumes of information and the need for ever more sophisticated and flexible technologies for representing and managing that information"[<a class="ref" href="#walsh2008">Walsh 2008</a>]. Indeed, the life of "The Celestial Railroad" in the antebellum press, as it was passed from publication to publication across the country, closely resembles the lives of modern texts that move freely among traditional periodicals, blogs, tweets, and Facebook posts.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Re-authorship of Hawthorne’s "The Celestial Railroad"</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">In <cite class="title italic">American Literature and the Culture of Reprinting</cite>, Meredith McGill argues that the antebellum American experience of texts was shaped by the widespread, normative practice of reprinting stories and poems, without authorial permission, in newspapers, literary magazines, and other media. "Reprinting," she argues, "is a form of textual production that is inseparable from distribution and reception…reprinted texts call attention to the repeated acts of articulation by which culture and its audiences are constituted" [<a class="ref" href="#mcgill2003">McGill 2003</a>, 5]. "The Celestial Railroad" exemplifies the culture McGill describes. The tale was explicitly rearticulated by editors, who often prefaced their reprintings with laudatory introductions that contextualized Hawthorne’s story for their readers. Not unlike a popular link on the internet, the impact of Hawthorne’s story on culture can largely be judged by how often the work was reappropriated and recontextualized. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">In the United States before the Civil War, a significant proportion of any author’s audience was deeply religious. It is this religious audience that Candy Gunther Brown locates in <cite class="title italic">The Word in the World</cite>, where she argues that American "evangelicals viewed participation in a textual community defined by an informal canon of texts…using the Word and their own words to influence the world’s redemption" [<a class="ref" href="#brown2004">Brown 2004</a>, 1].

David Paul Nord identifies early nineteenth-century publishers of tracts and religious newspapers as producers of America’s first mass medium [<a class="ref" href="#nord2004">Nord 2004</a>]. "By the end of the 1840s," Brown tells us, "most religious denominations endorsed at least one periodical per state, many of them privately owned but issued in the name of the editor’s denomination." Brown provides useful figures for the larger periodicals market at well: "there were perhaps 5,000–6,000 periodicals founded during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, 4,000–5,000 in the second quarter, 2,500 from 1850 to 1865, and 4,300 in the 1870s, with a total circulation of 10.5 million, or enough to reach one in three Americans" [<a class="ref" href="#brown2004">Brown 2004</a>, 145, 154]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">In the 1840s and 50s those religious readers encountered "The Celestial Railroad" in their denomination’s newspapers, magazines, and tracts, and Hawthorne’s fame grew in the religious press even as Hawthorne complained about his stories’ obscurity. McGill argues that "the presumption of Hawthorne’s rejection by the public has enabled critics to regard his early fiction through a highly selective lens," a claim the <cite class="title italic">Church Review and Ecclesiastical Register</cite> echoed directly in an 1851 review of <cite class="title italic">The Scarlet Letter</cite>. Noting Hawthorne’s own public complaints about his popularity, the <cite class="title italic">Review</cite> claims, "We think far more highly of Hawthorne than he does of himself, judging by the reflection which we find in his own mirror…you know that Hawthorne’s books are fairly thumbed to pieces by the readers of all circulating libraries" [<a class="ref" href="#anonymous1851">Anonymous 1851</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e633">[10]</a> Indeed, for readers of the <cite class="title italic">Review</cite> Hawthorne’s fame was built not on <cite class="title italic">The Scarlet Letter</cite>, but on "The Celestial Railroad". The <cite class="title italic">Review</cite> notes, "we were ignorant of the existence of so clever a writer, until we came across his 'Celestial Railroad,' in the columns of a newspaper" and deems "The Celestial Railroad""the most natural production of our author’s genius, which his books contain…It is one of the cleverest, most sustained, and most ingenious specimens of quiet satire to be found in our language."  This tale brought Hawthorne’s name into the consciousnesses of readers — evangelical, pious, geographically dispersed — who otherwise might not have known or cared to know it, so that in April of 1850 the <cite class="title italic">Christian Secretary</cite>, while listing contributors to <cite class="title italic">Graham’s Magazine</cite>, would refer to "Hawthorne, of Celestial Railroad memory"[<a class="ref" href="#anonymous1850">Anonymous 1850</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">The digital record of this story’s reprinting includes many similar plaudits, which are difficult to reconcile with most modern assessments of Hawthorne. Alfred Kazin speaks for many scholars when he claims that Hawthorne should be read purely as a religious outsider, for whom "[n]o orthodoxy, ever, permits the irony, skepticism, personal despair — above all else the sense of contradiction and unreality in human affairs that makes up the true storyteller" [<a class="ref" href="#kazin1997">Kazin 1997</a>, 38]. Religious readers of "The Celestial Railroad," however, valued Hawthorne’s story in large part because of its satirical bite. Writing about the American Sunday School Union’s (ASSU) popular tract version of "The Celestial Railroad" in 1874,<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e691">[11]</a> the Rev. George P. Fisher calls it "a curious fact that the Sunday-School Society should be the publisher of Hawthorne. But," he continues, "whoever has read 'the Celestial Railroad' will admit that this exquisite satire is well entitled to its place on the catalogue of books relating to religion, to be disseminated broadcast over the land" [<a class="ref" href="#fisher1874">Fisher 1874</a>, 1]. In other words, while religious readers did note with some curiousness their admiration for "The Celestial Railroad," they nonetheless defended its religious value. Its irony was not seen as antithetical to orthodoxy, but even instructional. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Denominational papers lauded the story’s "rich stores of instruction" [<a class="ref" href="#midnight1843">Midnight Cry 1843</a>], "the <em class="emph">moral</em> it teaches" [<a class="ref" href="#signs1843">Signs of the Times 1843</a>], and its "admirable commentary" [<a class="ref" href="#visit1843">Visit to the Celestial City 1843</a>], while being "repeatedly solicited to republish it" by their readers [<a class="ref" href="#christian1848">Christian Secretary 1848</a>]. It was "a startling, impressive little work, worthy to be a sequel to Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress" [<a class="ref" href="#evangelist1852">New York Evangelist 1852</a>] and a "remarkable satire on worldly religion"[<a class="ref" href="#advocate1869">Christian Advocate 1869</a>]. In 1847 the evangelical <cite class="title italic">New Englander</cite> journal wrote that "Mr. Hawthorne has a very pleasant and good natured, yet successful and effective way of hitting off, or satirizing the faults and foibles and errors of individuals and cliques, of schools, and communities, and ages"[<a class="ref" href="#d1847">D. 1847</a>, 61]. For the <cite class="title italic">New Englander</cite>, "The Celestial Railroad" was "that which, in this respect, surpasses all his other writings, and we were about to say the writings of all but John Bunyan"[<a class="ref" href="#d1847">D. 1847</a>, 61], while in 1869 the <cite class="title italic">Freewill Baptist Quarterly</cite> grouped "The Celestial Railroad" with <cite class="title italic">The Scarlet Letter</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The Marble Faun</cite> as the three works of Hawthorne that were "sure of long life."[<a class="ref" href="#anonymous1869">Anonymous 1869</a>, 1]. In fact, "The Celestial Railroad" seems to have joined "the informal, open-ended 'canon' of texts" that Brown claims shaped "an evangelical textual community" in the nineteenth century [<a class="ref" href="#brown2004">Brown 2004</a>, 7, 10]. It was frequently reprinted in denominational newspapers and anthologized in books for Sunday Schools and pastoral training. Perhaps more tellingly, its scenes and characters became so familiar for readers that writers frequently referred to them without providing any explanatory context; religious writers in the nineteenth century assumed that their readers knew "The Celestial Railroad."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">This popular history disappeared, however, into the mass of textual information that accumulated throughout the nineteenth century, "when the amount of recorded information produced…becomes overwhelming and nearly impossible to process through traditional means, such as reading" [<a class="ref" href="#walsh2008">Walsh 2008</a>]. Searchable digital archives allowed me to recover the social text of "The Celestial Railroad," while textual analysis software helped me make sense of its fluidity. John Bryant writes that "[d]igital scholarship offers alternatives that can raise the consciousness of readers about the inherent fluidity of texts and the modes of revision that cause textual fluidity" [<a class="ref" href="#bryant2011">Bryant 2011</a>, 46]. Bryant’s notion of "fluidity" refers primarily to authorial or authorized editorial revisions of literary texts; readers should "witness the different sequential versions of a work together as a representation of the invisible process of writing" [<a class="ref" href="#bryant2011">Bryant 2011</a>, 167]. However, Bryant’s insights can be extended also to texts like "The Celestial Railroad," which were revised by both authorized and unauthorized editors. Witnessing the "different sequential versions" of "The Celestial Railroad" offers insight into "the invisible process" of editing undertaken by nineteenth-century newspaper and magazine editors.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">When Hawthorne’s original text didn’t exactly fit the purposes of a given publication, it was freely emended, and even in rare cases expanded, to better fit the mission or message it was intended to convey. Leslee Thorne-Murphy calls this phenomenon "reauthorship: a combination of successive individuals writing, editing, and rewriting in a way that shapes anew the image of a single author" [<a class="ref" href="#thorne-murphy2010">Thorne-Murphy 2010</a>, 84]. For Thorne-Murphy reauthorship is "a type of editing that appropriates and refashions a text — a hybrid notion of authorship, one in which both editors and authors are creative and original rewriters" [<a class="ref" href="#thorne-murphy2010">Thorne-Murphy 2010</a>, 83]. Hawthorne’s "The Celestial Railroad" was frequently reauthored as it spread across the United States in the 1840s and 50s. Such editions of the story demonstrate not only Hawthorne’s influence on evangelical culture in 1843, but also the influence of contemporary evangelical culture on Hawthorne’s burgeoning national reputation, and perhaps its influence on Hawthorne himself. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">To discover these moments of reauthorship, I compared reprintings of "The Celestial Railroad" using the Juxta collation tool (<a class="ref" href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.juxtasoftware.org/'); return false">juxtasoftware.org</a>),<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e864">[12]</a> which allows scholars to visualize textual variation between witnesses of a text.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000144/resources/images/figure01.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000144/resources/images/figure01.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>A comparison set between the original <cite class="title italic">Democratic Review</cite> text and that of the <cite class="title italic">Signs of the Times</cite>.

Juxta was particularly useful in highlighting comparatively minor changes: those likely to slip my unmediated notice. I found that nearly every periodical reprinting of "The Celestial Railroad" modifies Hawthorne’s text somehow, though it is often difficult to gauge the intent behind particular changes. Some cuts seem space-saving, others aesthetic: many publications, for instance, edited Hawthorne’s purposefully archaic "burthens" to "burdens." The ASSU’s <cite class="title italic">Visit to the Celestial City</cite> anglicized the spellings of words, excised all references to body parts ("stomach" and "belly", in various places, became "front"), and cut Prince Beelzebub’s appearance during the narrator’s stay in Vanity.<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e914">[13]</a> The ASSU sought to combat spiritual ignorance by building libraries of religious instruction for children [<a class="ref" href="#nord2004">Nord 2004</a>, 81], and so we might speculate that these latter changes to "The Celestial Railroad" were designed to protect those children from tantalizing or frightening images. The two most frequently cut passages come from the narrator’s journey thorough Vanity Fair’s marketplace. Approximately one third of the witnesses excised the narrator’s description of "a very pretty girl" who "bartered a heart as clear as crystal" for a "worn and defaced…jewel of the same kind," as well as a passage detailing how "a member of Congress recruited his pocket by the sale of his constituents."</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000144/resources/images/figure02.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000144/resources/images/figure02.png" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>The original change highlighted from the <cite class="title italic">Midnight Cry</cite>'s reprinting.</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">It is possible that later witnesses copied the story, with the cut scenes, from earlier publications.

Because reprints circulated through complex textual networks, however, editorial decisions made by one editor rippled into other publications that did not necessarily share the priorities that drove the initial decision. Textual analysis tools such as Juxta draw particular attention to these editorial artifacts, which illuminate not, strictly, the text itself, but its social life within its culture.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Moral of "The Celestial Railroad"</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">That Hawthorne himself revised Bunyan likely contributed to the story’s success with contemporary religious readers. Brown argues that, while evangelicals "generally respected Bunyan’s original as one of the best books of all time," they also "felt no qualms about altering the book to suit" specific ecclesiastical or political needs [<a class="ref" href="#brown2004">Brown 2004</a>, 108]. Children’s versions were prepared for Sunday Schools, and several authors rewrote the tale with more pointed goals, such as William R. Weeks’s reformist <cite class="title italic">Pilgrim’s Progress in the Nineteenth Century</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#weeks1826">Weeks 1826, 1849</a>] and Sophia Louisa Little’s abolitionist <cite class="title italic">Pilgrim’s Progress in the Last Days</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#little1843">Little 1843</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e994">[15]</a> Hawthorne entered a market, then, that welcomed innovations from its established texts, and especially loved <cite class="title italic">Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">In the story, Hawthorne’s narrator relates a dream in which he visits Bunyan’s City of Destruction to find that a railroad had been constructed to the Celestial City. Proponents of the railroad tout its leisure, the way it clears difficulties — quite literally, as the railroad company tunneled through the Hill Difficulty that pilgrims once struggled over — from pilgrims’ paths. Like Bunyan’s Christian, Hawthorne’s narrator encounters other travelers along his route, not all of them pilgrims, including Mr. Smooth-it-away, who serves as his guide and the conductor of the new railroad. Like Christian, he encounters monsters, such as the Giant Transcendentalist, who has replaced the Giants Pagan and Pope, and shouts at passing travelers "in so strange a phraseology, that we knew not what he meant" [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843a">Hawthorne 1843a</a>, 520]. Waypoints along the route, which the narrator searches out in "Mr. Bunyan’s road-book" [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843a">Hawthorne 1843a</a>, 518], are seen from the train window as the engine rushes by: the one exception being the city of Vanity Fair, where the train makes a long stop.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Hawthorne’s narrator naively believes that the world progresses steadily through technology and social improvement.<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e1038">[16]</a> He is impressed to learn of the demon Apollyon’s new employment as the train’s engine driver. He thrills at "the liberality of the age" in which "all musty prejudices are in a fair way to be obliterated" [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843a">Hawthorne 1843a</a>, 517]. He likewise rhapsodizes over the ease of train travel over the harsh experiences of "past pilgrims," and is enthralled by Vanity Fair’s "societies for all manner of virtuous purposes," into which "a man has merely to connect himself, throwing…his quota of virtue into the common stock" from which "the president and directors will take care that the aggregate amount be well applied" [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843a">Hawthorne 1843a</a>, 517, 520]. The narrator’s faith in progress is so complete that even after he encounters two "worthy simpletons" making their pilgrimage by foot and whose "sturdy repudiation of all part in [Vanity Fair’s] business or pleasures" convince him to leave, he still claims, "I was not simple enough to give up my original plan of gliding along easily and commodiously by rail-road" [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843a">Hawthorne 1843a</a>, 521–522]. In fact, the narrator and his fellow passengers marvel at the "preposterous obstinacy" of these "two dusty foot-travellers in the old pilgrim guise" who keep "their intolerable burthens on their backs" and refuse "to take advantage of modern improvements." The modern pilgrims mock them, while Apollyon blows smoke and steam into their faces for the amusement of his passengers [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843a">Hawthorne 1843a</a>, 517]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">The old-fashioned pilgrims follow a parallel path to the narrator’s throughout the story.

The story ends within sight of the Celestial City, where Mr. Stick-to-the-right and Mr. Go-the-old-way are seen entering the city’s gates amid "an exulting strain…of music, with height, and depth, and sweetness…at once tender and triumphant" [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843a">Hawthorne 1843a</a>, 523]. Hawthorne’s old-fashioned pilgrims endure the trials the narrator avoids — Hill Difficulty, the Slough of Despond — and in the end these evils, described by the narrator in thoroughly modern terms as "inconveniences," are reconciled by their triumphant entrance into eternity. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">The narrator’s story, by contrast, ends at the terminus of the railroad line, as its passengers are shuttled out of the cars and into "[a] steam ferry boat, the last improvement on this important route." Mr. Smooth-it-away declines to cross with them, "a twinkle of livid flame" springing "out of either eye, proving indubitably" his fiendish nature, heretofore hidden to the modern pilgrims. As Mr. Smooth-it-away promises the narrator "We shall meet again," he implies that the boat is headed not to the Celestial City at all, but to Hell [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1843a">Hawthorne 1843a</a>, 523]. The narrator’s allegorical Christian life is revealed as a series of failures to encounter spiritual trials or to make difficult, or even uncomfortable, spiritual decisions.

The paratexts that constitute the textual network of "The Celestial Railroad" — e.g. introductions to the story, articles using the story as illustration, sermons based on the story — often read Hawthorne’s narrator as representative of a false faith in progress for progress’s sake. The Giant Transcendentalist, the misguided divines of Vanity Fair, and the other figures of the tale were seen as the debased products of such compromises. What consistently changed, however, as the story passed between newspapers, magazines, and anthologies, were the real-world antecedents to Hawthorne’s allegorical figures: the people or groups that each paper identified as dangerous religious innovators.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">For the Adventist readers of the <cite class="title italic">Signs of the Times</cite>, deeply invested in a vision of Jesus Christ’s imminent Second Coming, Hawthorne’s story "admirably illustrates the progress made in <cite class="title italic">popular</cite> religion since the days of John Bunyan, and shows the improvements made by the Transcendentalists and Neologists, to be found in our modern popular churches.

The <cite class="title italic">Signs</cite> implies that those "who are the most bitter against the coming of Christ" — in other words, those who are most critical of the Adventists’ central doctrine — are the improvers of religion Hawthorne satirizes — the Directors or passengers of the Celestial Railroad. By contrast, the <cite class="title italic">Signs</cite> implies that Adventist believers, anxiously watching the signs of the times, are the "dusty foot travelers," Mr. Stick-to-the-right and Mr. Go-the-old-way, evangelizing to their misguided brethren.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">However, ten days later a neighboring publication would suggest an opposite interpretation of the story.

Both papers use "admirably" to assess the story’s depiction of failures in contemporary religious practice. The <cite class="title italic">Palladium</cite> next refers to the <cite class="title italic">Signs</cite>'s publication of the story, noting that "[t]he article was originally published in the Democratic Review, and has since been copied by brother Himes" (the editor of <cite class="title italic">Signs</cite>). This arch, familiar "brother Himes" hints at the paragraph’s ultimate turn, as the <cite class="title italic">Palladium</cite> wonders "if this last-mentioned brother, if he should look carefully, could not see his own face reflected in the looking-glass somewhere"[<a class="ref" href="#anonymous1843b">Anonymous 1843b</a>, 2]. In other words, the <cite class="title italic">Palladium </cite>asserts that "The Celestial Railroad," which Himes confidently printed as an indictment of non-Adventist Christians, instead indicts Adventists — implying that Adventism is not a return to authentic, biblical Christianity, but a neologism to be condemned. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">Such vehement sectarian rhetoric was, in the 1840s, a relatively new phenomenon in the United States.

Over the next decades, however, use of "sectarian" steadily increases. By 1850, "sectarian" appears in 0.000375% of the books in the corpora published in the U.S. In other words, books and periodicals in 1850 used "sectarian" more than ten times more frequently than books in 1800: an increase of an order of magnitude.<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e1262">[18]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">To make sense of this data, of course, we must "abandon the quantitative universe" and situate the use of "sectarian" within literary and historical contexts [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>, 24]. We must zoom in. In this case, the dramatic increase in use of "sectarian" comes during a period of rapid denominational schism in the United States. By the 1840s and 50s, the nation’s largest denominations — Methodist, Baptist, etc. — comprised a quickly-multiplying host of sub-groups, sects within sects, each insisting on the sanctity of particular social, political, or theological distinctions. Perhaps most importantly, in 1845 — two years after the initial printing of "The Celestial Railroad," and in the middle of its run through the evangelical press — the Baptist and Methodist denominations in the United States both split into northern and southern conventions over slavery. This rapid denominational centrifugation bred anxiety about how thoroughly churches could disagree and disperse while remaining members of one mystical body. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">Brown sees this tension as latent in the mission and purpose of the antebellum religious press. On the one hand, the religious press fostered the "informal canon" of evangelical texts to which "The Celestial Railroad" belonged. This set of documents, both secular and sacred, and shared across many sects, fortified a sense of "an invisible…pilgrim community" of believers united by their common evangelical Christianity [<a class="ref" href="#brown2004">Brown 2004</a>, 9]. But such ecumenical efforts were often undermined by zealous denominational editors and publishers, who "saw themselves countering the errors of the secular press and rival religious denominations by proclaiming pure gospel truth" [<a class="ref" href="#brown2004">Brown 2004</a>, 52]. A crowded religious periodicals market necessitated that publications distinguish themselves in order to attract and retain subscribers. Searching nineteenth-century newspaper archives for key theological terms bears this argument out. One finds vehement articles defending large and small gradations of doctrine and practice: articles for and against infant baptism, predestination, the reality or unreality of hell, and even the morality or immorality of children’s Sunday Schools.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Distinctly denominational critiques are hard to identify in Hawthorne’s original text of "The Celestial Railroad". There are the Giant Transcendentalist and Pope, but the divines of Vanity Fair are never identified precisely. Looking at the wide social textual network this study has unearthed, we can see that whomever Hawthorne meant to parody, his readers redirected the story’s satire toward their own targets. For antebellum believers, "The Celestial Railroad" resonated because it spoke to the general problem of denominationalism — satirizing the religious "neologists" who have innovated the Christian message until unrecognizable — while simultaneously provoking print wars that entrenched denominational battle lines. While the satire of "The Celestial Railroad" was read as an attack on sectarianism, the history of its reprinting paradoxically reinforced denominational disagreements. "Rail roads to 'the Celestial City,'" the <cite class="title italic">Wisconsin Argus</cite> complained in 1845, "cross each other in every direction" [<a class="ref" href="#anonymous1845">Anonymous 1845</a>, 2].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">In introductions to the story and editorials referencing it, religious editors and readers consistently identified their sectarian rivals with Hawthorne’s Mr. Smooth-it-away, the Rev.

In 1855, the Washington, D.C. newspaper <cite class="title italic">National Intelligencer</cite> lamented the trend of rewriting <cite class="title italic">Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>,<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e1345">[19]</a> noting that "[n]early every interested observer of the religious spirit of the age has thought, spoken, or written his own story of the modern pilgrims. It has become the common courtesy ecclesiastic," the article continues, "for us to ascribe to each church other than our own some innovation on the old line of travel; the old line being of course <em class="emph">ours</em> — Bunyan being, like Paul, always the Coryphæus of the creed of the household wherein he is read" [<a class="ref" href="#anonymous1855">Anonymous 1855</a>]. <a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e1374">[20]</a> Writing about "The Celestial Railroad," the <cite class="title italic">Intelligencer</cite> claims its "wide popularity" was due to the fact that its "idea corresponded to the prevalent suggestions in many minds," while "it was so general that it did not take sides for or against any sect; so it could be freely used by every sect against the rest, and was therefore eagerly printed in all church newspapers…and each family read it on Sunday evening in its own weekly, with sly whispers of a Minie rifle-shot into the ranks of 'some so-called Christians they knew of'"[<a class="ref" href="#anonymous1855">Anonymous 1855</a>]. Readers claimed affinity with the "old-fashioned pilgrims" and contrasted themselves with the This-todays and That-tomorrows of the other churches in town. As the <cite class="title italic">Intelligencer</cite> points out, this identification was simplified by the broad allegorical strokes of Hawthorne’s original. The reader knows only the Rev. Dr. Wind-of-Doctrine’s name.

He then encounters the two old-fashioned pilgrims much earlier than did Hawthorne’s narrator, describing how they "looked to me exactly like the picture which my fancy had formed of Bunyan’s pilgrim." The pair proceed to warn the narrator that they "are fleeing from the wrath to come" because "the Judgment which for a long time has lingered, is just about to be executed, and all these things shall be dissolved"[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1844a">Hawthorne 1844a</a>, 3].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">Nearly every page of the <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite>'s "Celestial Railroad" revises Hawthorne’s original.

These passengers point to many distinctly Adventist concerns about their religious contemporaries: that they clung too fiercely to temporal things (Messr. Love-lust, Messr. Hold-to-the-world, Miss Ornament), that they too flippantly dismissed their Adventist brethren (Messr. Worldly-wise-man, Messr. Presumption, Miss Thoughtless), or that they too readily and thoughtlessly modernized faith (Miss Novelize). Accordingly, the <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite>'s train passes new sites, "the town of Morality, which has grown very much since Bunyan’s day" and "the newly settled but thriving towns of Deism, Universalism, and Restoration"[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1844a">Hawthorne 1844a</a>, 8]. <a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e1726">[26]</a> Later in the <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite>'s version the narrator will add the newly chartered "provinces of Carnality and Formality, in which we observed the flourishing towns of Mormonism, Love-gain, Community, Puseyism, Self-righteousness, and Falsepeace," and "Scoffers-town"[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1844a">Hawthorne 1844a</a>, 22–23]. These new towns share the map with places from Hawthorne’s and Bunyan’s originals, such as the City of Destruction, where the narrator’s pilgrimage begins, "the town of Shun-repentance," and Vanity. By federating new theologies, such as Mormonism, with such disreputable neighbors, the <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite> emphasizes its disdain for them, and clarifies for the reader precisely who they should read as "modern professors of religion" or "neologists."<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e1754">[27]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">The <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite> emphasizes this threat in its detailed description of the preachers of Vanity.

The <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite>, by contrast, links each figure to a specific contemporary doctrine, pinning down the allegorical connection, and stemming potential alternative readings of each figure. In the <cite class="title italic">Examiner</cite> the Rev. Mr. Bewilderment proves "that the Bible, although truly called a Revelation, is nevertheless an unrevealed revelation to man," a doctrine opposed to William Miller’s assertion that "the Bible is its own interpreter."

The passengers pass one man "expound[ing] the Book of Daniel," warning them to "Consider the vision, consider the vision!" and another expounding Revelation, warning, "Behold, I come quickly"[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1844a">Hawthorne 1844a</a>, 22–23]. Finally, the <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite>'s version ends not within sight of the Celestial City, or with the steam ferry boat of Hawthorne’s original, but with the narrator’s realization that the train has circled fully around, "back almost to the City of Destruction." There waits Evangelist, who continues to warn the erstwhile pilgrims of the impending apocalypse.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">The <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite> rewrites the ending of "The Celestial Railroad" into an explicitly apocalyptic message — a warning that the end of time is near.

The <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite> then hopes that "the brief, cutting, but truly faithful description here given of the journey to the heavenly city by this most deceitful route," which the story has identified with specific contemporary theologies and eschatologies, "prove the saving of the soul to some who are about to take their seats in the car of <cite class="title italic">Popular Profession</cite>." Instead, the final lines urge, they should choose "the good old path" which, again, this revision has explicitly identified with the "Millerites" castigated by Mr. Smooth-it-away in Vanity Fair [<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1844a">Hawthorne 1844a</a>, 24].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">This most drastic revision of "The Celestial Railroad" exemplifies the antebellum religious press’s relationship with Hawthorne’s text.

The latter describes Hawthorne, who famously complained in an April 1844 letter to Horatio Bridge, "I continue to scribble tales, with good success so far as regards empty praise…But the pamphlet and piratical system has so broken up regular literature, that I am forced to work hard for small gains"[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1987">Hawthorne 1987</a>, 27].

Those three words, "taken possession of," can be read as legal or textual, though it may not have occurred to editors within the antebellum climate of reprinting to worry about Hawthorne’s pecuniary or legal interests. The <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite>'s caveat to its reprinting highlights different anxieties. Garvey argues that "The phenomenon of reprinting allowed different meanings to become attached" to a work [<a class="ref" href="#garvey2006">Garvey 2006</a>, 161]. When the <cite class="title italic">Bible Examiner</cite> admits that Hawthorne’s "sentiments" may not align with the revised story or that he would not "endorse" its message, it admits that the <cite class="title italic">meaning</cite> of Hawthorne’s story had been "taken possession of" as much as the words themselves. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">If Hawthorne was aware of pamphlet versions of "The Celestial Railroad" published in Boston and Philadelphia, it seems likely that he was aware of some of the many newspaper, magazine, and tract reprintings, several of which were published close to him in Salem, Boston, and Cambridgeport. It seems not unlikely that he worried over both the material repossession of his words — the unauthorized and unpaid reprintings of "The Celestial Railroad" — and the metaphorical repossession of his name and of his story’s meaning and message. "The Celestial Railroad," as we’ve seen, was co-opted by such ideologically and theologically distinct groups as Congregationalists, Methodists, Baptists, Adventists, Quakers, Perfectionists, Abolitionists, and others, and said each time to speak for them against all comers. Though Hawthorne certainly wanted legal protection and monetary compensation for his work, his frustration at being "taken possession of" was likely more than simply pecuniary. In 1843 Hawthorne was still largely unknown. If "the tradition that grows around a work's authorship can have an intense effect on how the work is read and understood"[<a class="ref" href="#garvey2006">Garvey 2006</a>, 159], then denominational re-authorizations of "The Celestial Railroad" threatened to brand Hawthorne in ways he may have found distasteful. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53">There is some textual evidence — small, but telling — that argues this more nuanced understanding of Hawthorne’s reaction to "The Celestial Railroad" in the religious press.

Whatever Hawthorne’s own religious opinions, they couldn’t possibly have aligned with all those who claimed "The Celestial Railroad" for themselves. After the publication of <cite class="title italic">Mosses</cite>, Mr. Foot-it-to-heaven journeys through the pages of secular reprintings, in papers such as <cite class="title italic">Littell’s Living Age</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#hawthorne1860">Hawthorne 1860</a>].

The enthusiastic reception of this story by religious readers inducted Hawthorne, perhaps unwillingly, into the canon of texts that defined religious communities in the nineteenth century. The "keen satire" of "The Celestial Railroad" was not anathema to the religious press or religious readers: quite the opposite, in fact, as Hawthorne’s satire against the "modern" and "easy" Christianity is precisely what drew religious readers to the text. Hawthorne’s early reputation, at least with certain readers, seems to have been founded on a work that modern readers often overlook. Moreover, the history of this short story helps clarify our understanding of the antebellum religious press as a tool of both ecumenical outreach and fervent denominational debate. "The Celestial Railroad" was popular for its perceived anti-denominational message, but also for its usefulness in denominational debates. The essentially undefined antecedents for Hawthorne’s allegorical figures permitted a breadth of interpretation across the spectrum of belief, allowing readers, editors, and preachers to create sectarian readings with relative ease, and to deploy the story against those doctrinal innovators they saw as dangerous to their own, "authentic" Christian faith.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">Ironies abound in this history of Hawthorne’s "Celestial Railroad."

Though the tale’s central, ironized symbol of uncritical modernization is the railroad, the story’s social textual network likely expanded through the railroad network.<a class="noteRef" href="#d27448e2139">[31]</a></div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000144/resources/images/figure06.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/7/1/000144/resources/images/figure06.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 6. </div>Tanner’s 1846 map has been overlaid here with railroad data from William G.

Julia Flanders notes similar tensions at the heart of digital humanities work: 
           <blockquote><p>If the rhetoric at the heart of the "digital" side of "digital humanities" is strongly informed by a narrative of technological progress, the "humanities" side has equally strong roots in a humanities sensibility which both resists a cumulative idea of progress (one new thing building on another) and yearns for a progressive agenda (doing better all the time). The theoretical and methodological shifts that constitute disciplinary change in the humanities, when viewed in retrospect, do not appear clearly progressive in the way that sequences of scientific discoveries do, though they do appear developmental: they are an ongoing attempt to understand human culture, from the changing perspective of the culture itself. [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2009">Flanders 2009</a>, 8]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">Modern scholarly readers of "The Celestial Railroad" perhaps share its original readers’ ambivalence.

Hawthorne is, of course, a hypercanonical writer, but "The Celestial Railroad" has been for a century one of his least read and least studied works. Through digital archives and textual analysis tools, we have learned that "The Celestial Railroad" should be understood as a central text of Hawthorne’s early career. These new tools also shift our understanding of Hawthorne’s religious readers, who were far more open to his satirical edge than scholars have imagined. If digital scholarship can shift our view of Hawthorne, his readers, and the values those readers associated with his stories, more discoveries no doubt await scholars of other authors, both canonical and non-canonical. As we continue to dig into digital archives in search of bibliographic treasure, exciting revisions to our literary history promise to multiply — an outcome that should thrill digital humanists and traditional literary scholars alike.</div></div><div id="appendix" class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Appendix</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">Below is my current bibliography of "Celestial Railroad" reprintings during the nineteenth century.
