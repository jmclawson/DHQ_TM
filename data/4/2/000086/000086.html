After work with community development corporations on the East Coast, Plotkin entered graduate school in urban history at the University of Illinois at Chicago. During this period in the early nineties, Plotkin had a job with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and then collaborated on the development of the forum that became H-Net. In addition to standards and protocols about new communication technologies, face-to-face relationships grew out of online exchanges, often with lively disagreements about the direction of H-Net. Plotkin’s own broadening use of digital tools prompts her concluding reflections on historians’ continuing need to use the Internet to overcome physical and intellectual fragmentation, and how the Internet has democratized the field of history.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Preamble</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">For three years now (2007-10), I have been the project coordinator for the
                <a class="ref" href="http://www.cii.illinois.edu/" onclick="window.open('http://www.cii.illinois.edu/'); return false">Community Informatics Initiative of the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois</a>, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Community informatics (CI) is an emerging field, with continuing debates about definitions and core questions.  Informatics is the study of information systems and processes, including computational, social, and individual cognition.  CI, with its social emphasis, aims to understand not only how communities access, create, organize, and share information, but also the types and qualities of connections between and among communities.  CI scholars and practitioners examine the uses of information and communication technologies in geographically-distinct and underserved areas, and work with local communities to achieve their goals. This focus stresses that reciprocity must characterize relationships that involve the distribution and use of information.  Community members spearhead both naming the issues of the community and the process leading to solutions.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">As an historian, I puzzle over which concepts contributed to the emergence of
                community informatics. One convergence of ideas I wanted to investigate occurred in
                the 1990s. Seventeen years ago, in 1993, Wendy Plotkin was a graduate student in urban history at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Her graduate assistantship gave her an early entrée to the world of computers and the Internet. She used this experience to become a key participant in the launching of <a class="ref" href="http://www.h-net.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.h-net.org/'); return false">H-Net</a> (Humanities and Social Sciences on Line), an organization devoted to using the Internet for scholarly communication, together with a professor of political history, Richard Jensen, and another graduate student, Kelly Richter, who specialized in Civil War history. The first of the scholarly forums was <a class="ref" href="http://www.h-net.org/~urban/" onclick="window.open('http://www.h-net.org/~urban/'); return false">H-Urban</a>, which Wendy established as a model for the later forums, and which is how I came to know her.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Wendy and I met in person for the first time in Chicago, Illinois, in July
                        2008, after having developed a virtual relationship since 2002, when I
                        became review editor for H-Urban.  I wanted to document her memories and
                        ideas relating to the early years of H-Urban.  During two conversations in
                        Chicago — one at a noisy restaurant in Greektown and a second follow-up meeting in the Italian neighborhood near the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago — Wendy shared her insights about online scholarly communication. Our conversations then continued in email exchanges between Wendy and me that covered the history of H-Net and H-Urban, her growing interest in geospatial technologies, and her ideas for future projects. This article thus takes the form of an extended interview in three parts. The first focuses on Wendy’s background as a planner and community activist in Boston in the 1970s and 1980s.  The second examines her decision to become a historian upon her return to Chicago (her hometown) in 1990, and her involvement in the creation of H-Net, H-Urban, and COMM-ORG, in the subsequent decade.  The third considers her broadening use of digital tools, reflections on historians’ continuing need to use the Internet to overcome physical and intellectual fragmentation, and ideas about how the Internet has democratized the field of history.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">— Sharon Irish</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Participating in the Community Revolution of the 1970s</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5"><table summary="quoted speech"><tr><td class="speaker">Sharon Irish</td><td>Wendy, your background in urban planning and policy (especially your years of employment in Boston on housing and economic development issues) really influenced your historical scholarship.

In the 1980s, it organized against gentrification, developing affordable and ecologically sound housing that included long-term subsidies to maintain a racially and economically diverse neighborhood.  I saw up close, not only the economic, but also the social benefits accruing to community members who participated in decisions that affected their lives.  They helped to influence the course of development in their neighborhoods, and experienced strong communal ties that grew as a result of their collaboration.</td></tr></table></div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000086/...000086/resources/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000086/...000086/resources/figure01.jpg" alt="Burbank Street Building"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>Fensgate Housing Cooperative, <a class="ref" href="http://fensgate.com.p6.hostingprod.com/" onclick="window.open('http://fensgate.com.p6.hostingprod.com/'); return false">http://fensgate.com.p6.hostingprod.com/</a>

                    mixed-income housing. The 1904 building, listed on the National

                    apartments, one on each floor. Today, it has 46 apartments whose
                    different prices reflect the goal of the building to house diverse

This is where chance played a role.  I interviewed with both the history and planning departments at the University of Illinois at Chicago; the historian with whom I met was far more interested in my joining the program than the planner.

My interest in racial deed restrictions was
                    stimulated by my community experiences in Boston.   CDCs were part of a major

                    control, itself an outgrowth of the emphasis on "participatory democracy." 
                    As a person who had witnessed (during my childhood) the use of such control to
                    thwart racial integration in Chicago — one of the most segregated cities in the

                    so as to raise consciousness about the darker side of neighborhood-based
                    control, and alert newer organizations to the dangers of parochialism.  I was
                    especially interested in the use of racial deed restrictions by developers and
                    neighborhood groups, because, contrary to public understanding, these were an

    chose faculty member Richard Jensen to guide me. Richard was already legendary for his

    the founding director of the Newberry Library’s Quantitative Institute, which trained over 800 scholars in using quantitative methods in history. Certain similarities existed between Jensen’s goals for the institute and H-Net.  Both brought together scholars with similar interests in an emerging field of history, and tended to attract participants from smaller universities and colleges who had fewer networking opportunities than those with larger faculties and student bodies [<a class="ref" href="#jensen1983">Jensen 1983</a>].

However, I recommended that this new forum instead use Listserv, a more advanced technology I had familiarity with through my work at the TEI. Listserv was superior to the "bulletin board" technology in a number of ways: it had the advantage of automatically creating "logs" of all messages, as well as having the capability of storing files.

In Washington, we visited both the American Historical Association (AHA) and the NEH, and shared our ideas with them.  Both organizations were encouraging. We went back to UIC and prepared an application for funding by NEH.  The first grant was turned down, but the second one, submitted after H-Net had begun operations, succeeded.

    (the classical scholars were far ahead).<a class="noteRef" href="#d28335e497">[11]</a>  Thus, when we created H-Net and H-Urban, we consciously set out to develop something that would be different — that would be dominated by scholars and practitioners in auxiliary disciplines, and that would have a scholarly tone.  Unlike the more free-wheeling online groups on history at the time, H-Net incorporated a strong commitment to core values in academia, including deference to more established scholars and high standards for the content of scholarly communication.  Our goal was to wed the best contemporary practices in humanities scholarship to the new possibilities opened up by the Internet.  To do this, we created "moderated" lists, in which all messages would have to go through an advanced graduate student, faculty member, or practitioner.  Early on, possibly after the lists had started, we also decided that each list should have a "board" of the leading scholars in the field.  Thus, drawing on the democratic nature of the early Internet, I began to write to urban historians of some repute, and asked them to serve on H-Urban's board.  Most agreed.  We created the idea of separate lists for the board, and Edboard-Urban was born.

They deemed this the only "knowledge" worthy of study, and overlooked the lives and activities of non-elites — the middle and working classes; racial, ethnic, and religious minorities; women; and children.

                            1970s, the administration of President Jimmy Carter provided funding to
                            regional planning agencies under two initiatives — the Areawide Housing
                            Opportunity Program and the Regional Housing Mobility Program — to
                            promote fair and affordable housing in the nation’s metropolitan
                            regions. The goal of the program was to promote "deconcentration"
                            of racial minorities from the inner cities to the suburbs. My supervisor
                            was a former community organizer who was opposed to moving
                            African-American residents out of the inner city into the suburbs. While
                            opening up the suburbs to African Americans and other racial minorities
                            was an admirable objective, in the absence of similar initiatives to
                            allow them to stay in improved neighborhoods in the city, it looked a
                            lot like the "Negro removal" of the urban renewal programs of the
                            1950s, at a time when the energy crisis was encouraging white
                            gentrification.  Staff from regional housing agencies around the country
                            convinced HUD to change the interpretation of the statutory language of the Regional Housing Mobility Program so that, instead of encouraging movement from their neighborhoods, the funds could be used to revitalize the neighborhoods.  Watching my supervisor’s participation in these negotiations with HUD, I learned the importance of advocacy and personal contact in shaping how the government implements (or does not implement) legislation, a lesson on the informal processes that affect governance.</div><div class="endnote" id="d28335e161"><span class="noteRef">[2]</span>The Boston Housing Partnership was an umbrella program to garner resources and assist ten community development corporations in rehabilitating and managing a total of 1000 units of multifamily housing in their neighborhoods.

These systems were initially set up to allow scientists to exchange large electronic files, but the convenience of exchanging short messages was discovered immediately.  The initial civilian system — ARPANET — sent its first message in 1969, but much work remained to develop the physical and systems infrastructure to embrace an entire nation. See Barry M. Leiner et al., "All About the Internet: History of the Internet," at <a class="ref" href="http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml" onclick="window.open('http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml'); return false">http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml</a>.<br/><br/>For the most part, humanities scholars did not begin to use these systems until the mid-1980s, a decade before the term <em class="term">Internet</em> was adopted for what was, by then, far more seamless and user-friendly than in its early days.  Textbook publishers were among the earliest funders of humanities networks, hoping to obtain better information for planning purposes.  Among academicians, classicists and literary/linguistic scholars were among the first to use this new tool for group communication, with the creation of <cite class="title italic">Humanist</cite> and the <cite class="title italic">Bryn Mawr Classical Review</cite> (BMCR, which only distributed book reviews). In 1985, the "Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link" (WELL) brought together "authors, programmers, journalists, activists and other creative people" to communicate online (<a class="ref" href="http://www.well.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.well.com/'); return false">http://www.well.com/</a>). At the same time,Professor Lynn Nelson at Kansas State University and others started the first history discussion lists, including Mediev-L, History-L, and HAPSBURG.  These lists, while containing some valuable content, did not screen messages or limit their subscriptions to scholars, and were liable to more casual use by amateur historians.
