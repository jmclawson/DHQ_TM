                    relatively recent past, this scholarly edition is the tail of a long chain of
                    cultural reading and re-reading of Van Gogh’s letters, extracts of which were
                    already being published in the 1890s, immediately after the artist’s death, with
                    the first print edition appearing in 1914. Of all the preceding publications,
                    what makes this scholarly enterprise particularly interesting for the readers of
                        <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> is that it is the first complete edition of
                    Van Gogh’s correspondence to have been published in digital form and made
                    available on the web.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Hence in the present review we ask, What does digital form mean in this case of
                    hybrid (print/web) production? How was the whole edition produced? Does the web
                    incarnation make a difference? What added value, if any, does it bring
                    about?</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Books with a Digital Backbone</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">It is noteworthy that the digital edition — intended here in the wide sense of
                    the full set of software, programs, scripts, electronic marked-up texts, digital
                    images — represents the backbone not only of the web edition, but also of a
                    refined printed edition; indeed, quoting the editors, the print edition would
                    not exist in its present form without its electronic matrix, which is much more
                    that just the counterpart of its paper version: <blockquote><p>By 2004
                        changes in the world of publishing and the rapidly growing potential offered
                        by electronic media had caused the steering committee to reconsider, and it
                        was decided to publish the large, all-encompassing edition digitally. This
                        does greater justice to the immense volume of material and the complex of
                        interrelated layers of information, and gives visitors to the site more
                        options and more ways to use the edition. For the very significant numbers
                        of people we believe would prefer to study or enjoy the letters by reading
                        them in the "traditional" manner, there is an accessible, fully
                        illustrated print version, with brief notes; <em class="emph">the content derives
                            directly from the scholarly web edition</em> [my emphasis]. This
                        five-volume edition appears — at the same time as the present web edition —
                        in three languages: English, Dutch and French.</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">This new complete print edition of Vincent van Gogh’s letters was distributed
                    worldwide as British edition (slipcased with a CD-ROM of the letters in their
                    original languages, mainly Dutch) by [<a class="ref" href="#thames2009">Thames &amp; Hudson 2009</a>] in 2009. It
                    encompasses more than two thousand pages in six heavy volumes of translucent
                    paper, the first five of which include the corpus of translated letters where
                    each main text section is beautifully laid out in one or two columns and
                    accompanied by editorial side notes, relevant small illustrations (art works in
                    the form of paintings and etchings that Van Gogh mentions in his correspondence
                    or that the editors imply are referred to by the Dutch author), and some
                    facsimiles of the letters in full page (generally only when a sketch by the
                    artist occurs). The letters, each of which is preceded by some introductory
                    material, are grouped into chronological sections marking certain segments of
                    Van Gogh's life.</div><div id="table01" class="table"><table class="table"><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure01.jpg" alt=""/></a></td><td valign="top" class="cell"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure02.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure02.jpg" alt=""/></a></td></tr></table><div class="caption"><div class="label">Table 1. </div>On the left the 6 blue volumes next to a box of matches.

                    other volumes by including a comprehensive and detailed set of indices: an index
                    of authorial works, divided into an index by title and indices ordered by the
                    work’s classification number organised by type (paintings, x-rays and

                    photographs, documents, periodicals and literary works; index of biblical
                    quotations (subdivided into relevant books and sections); index of people, in
                    general and by correspondent (the majority of the letters are addressed to Van
                    Gogh’s brother, Theo); and index of places. The latter includes subdivisions of
                    cities into relevant locations by type (e.g. cathedral or tower); interestingly,
                    art exhibitions are also marked as distinct references within locations.</div><div id="figure03" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure03.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure03.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>Snippet from volume 6: first part of the list of references to

                    the web edition. Their inclusion in the web edition — possibly with the
                    exception of the index of locations, which is less granular on the web — is
                    always comprehensive, rather than selective as in the print version, and is
                    enriched by further interconnected material. Indeed, starting from the text
                    view, the web edition includes the following additional components: the texts in
                    original language (mainly Dutch, in few cases French and English),<a class="noteRef" href="#d38781e136">[1]</a> the diplomatic edition and, not only some, but all the
                    facsimiles.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">It also seems that at places the web edition contains some diversified or
                    entirely new material: for example, in letter 282, the illustration of the
                    artwork <cite class="title italic">Sorrow</cite> by Vincent van Gogh is available
                    only as black and white reproduction of the relevant lithograph in the printed
                    edition volume 2, while on the web, its coloured impression is also reproduced:
                        <cite class="title italic">F 929 / JH 129</cite> (click on the "artworks"

                    example is the drawing entitled "Reader" by the
                    artist and Van Gogh’s friend Anthon Gerard Alexander van Rappard; in the books,
                    the relevant illustration is reproduced rather small only along the text of
                    letter 178, while on the web, we find it under the artworks tab of both letters
                    the notes of which mention it: 168 and 178.</div><div id="table02" class="table"><table class="table"><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure04.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure04.jpg" alt=""/></a></td><td valign="top" class="cell"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure05.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/2/000088/...000088/resources/figure05.jpg" alt=""/></a></td></tr></table><div class="caption"><div class="label">Table 2. </div>The drawing entitled "Reader"

                    how its features support a fruition process that is rather distinctive from the
                    reading process facilitated by its print form. Those mechanisms offered by the
                    web, such as pointers to a textual note in the books functioning as active links
                    on the web, are obviously exploited in the web resource in question. However,
                    the functionalities associated with the objects making up the edition are
                    amplified in its digital form in a manner that goes far beyond the emerging
                    conventions of academic web publishing. Indeed, the richness of an easy-to-read
                    interface in the web edition derives from the ability of its designers both to
                    understand and render the integrity of the editorial model behind it. It is
                    precisely the full appreciation of this model that lays the added value of the
                    web edition where, possibly, the intertextual dimension of the man Van Gogh as
                    writer, reader and artist all in one stands out even further than it does in the
                    book form (or in a physical exhibition; see <a href="#figure10">Figure
                        10</a>.) To the attentive reader the evidence of the underlying structure
                    of such editorial model is easily revealed.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">To start from the reading panels, the editorial model is manipulated so as to

                    results in a flexible choreography compared to the fixed layout of the books:
                    the balance lays much less in favour of the translated text as core of the

                    officially in 1994. During its lifecycle, the project engaged other national and
                    international initiatives relevant to Van Gogh studies by opening up its
                    development to an interdisciplinary framework, establishing cooperative efforts
                    of various kinds (between individuals and, more importantly across institutions

                    libraries and archives), and using lessons learned through past endeavours. The
                    open and collaborative nature of the work is evident when we examine the web
                    form of the edition where the production choices include the adoption of

                    into English, relevant notes (including textual notes), and the connection
                    between text and manuscript images — in brief, the full electronic backbone

                    interconnected data sources. Indeed, the editors compiled various databases
                    containing the physical descriptions of the letters, data about the
                    illustrations, and information about the people mentioned by the Dutch painter
                    in his correspondence. The integration between the TEI document compiled for
                    each letter and such complementary material is obtained by recurring to two

                    contextual databases becomes evident, as seen above, while using the indices or
                    the search facility as well as while encountering some para-textual information
                    accompanying the letters. For example, the captions of the illustrations or the
                    textual notes with references to artworks could not link back to the relevant
                        <span class="hi italic">index locorum</span> without such integration. Indeed, two
                    Ruby programmes were developed to generate an index from the TEI XML files as
                    well as from the relevant database sources, and to perform dynamic searches
                    prompted by the user on the resulting index. The search index itself is built by
                    recurring, yet again, to another open source software: <a class="ref" href="http://lucene.apache.org/" onclick="window.open('http://lucene.apache.org/'); return false">Apache Lucene</a>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">Moving to the digitisation process itself, the 902 surviving letters under study

                    demand, while minimising the loading effect on the network, since only portions
                    of the facsimile are effectively visualised at any given time. It has to be

                        Sciences</a> — renowned institutions in the field of scholarly publishing
                    of literary and historical texts — this new edition is the example of a
                    successful marriage between thorough editing processes and responsible
                    professional production of a rich electronic resource, which in fact is
                    attractive to a wide audience. It fulfils the highest scholarly standards while
                    at the same time being open to anyone with a web connection and some curiosity
                    towards the genial mind that was Vincent van Gogh’s. Such openness could have
                    possibly gone further by envisaging the possibility of users interacting with
                    this resource. At present, the web page section entitled "Updates" is empty
                    and does not contain any feedback mechanism, but instead promises that this
                    hybrid edition will record changes in both the web and print edition. It is
                    possibly too much to aim for, but that now that Van Gogh’s correspondence is all
                    skilfully edited, searchable, and beautifully integrated with all sorts of
                    contextual material and free to read online, one would think that the next step
                    could be to make it free to write and comment on. The Van Gogh Museum is not
                    insensitive to the issue and, though separate from the scholarly edition, has
                    already set up a blog: <a class="ref" href="http://www.vangoghsblog.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.vangoghsblog.com/'); return false">http://www.vangoghsblog.com/</a>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">Could have he known, Van Gogh, that after more than a hundred years his passion
                    would have become true heritage of his beloved ordinary women and men?</div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d38781e136"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>Despite
                        the fact that the letters are available in all original languages, it does
                        not seem to be possible to search letters by language in the search
                        form.</div><div class="endnote" id="d38781e233"><span class="noteRef">[2]</span>Understandably, line numbers are available only in the diplomatic
                        edition (only published on the web). Pointers to editorial notes are
                        available in all three versions of the text (original, diplomatic and
                        translated text). However, links to indices and the possibility to identify
                        referencing strings are only active in the translated text. This could
                        either mean that the relevant mark up has been applied to the translated
                        text only – and that in addition there is no one to one correspondence
                        between, for instance, referring strings in the original text and referring
                        strings in the translated texts – or simply that an editorial decision was
                        made to leave the original text and diplomatic edition cleaner to facilitate
                        reading.</div></div><div id="worksCited"><h2>Works Cited</h2><div class="bibl fallback"><span class="ref" id="thames2009"><!-- close -->Thames &amp; Hudson 2009</span> Jansen, Leo, Hans
