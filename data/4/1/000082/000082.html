     three different cases of genetic or compositional textual variants found in the autographs of
     the Italian contemporary poet Valerio Magrelli. These encoding experiments reflect the diverse
     nature of the artifacts and represent a critical assessment of the effectiveness of present
     encoding practices for the multidimensional and pragmatic aspects of authorial drafts. Thus
     far, it seems that the TEI has yet to offer a convincing theoretical model and adequate
     practical solutions for representing the complex temporal structures normally present in
     manuscripts, and in fluid textual traditions in general. Our conclusion is that there is a
     potential conflict between the linear and hierchical nature of current formal language systems
     such as XML, and the intrinsic dynamic nature of the writing process. In such cases we may have
     to rethink present models of document modeling, and to develop, within an adequate
     epistemological framework, a new theory of digital text.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">1. Fluid Text and Markup Languages</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In this paper we shall try to uncover, through some experiments in digital text-encoding, the
     complex multidimensional and interactive reality of the process of composition. This complexity
     emerges as a result of problems encountered in the description and representation of a series
     of autographic literary texts. The historical and theoretical background of our work is
     represented by various philological-critical schools such as the Italian criticism of variants
     (<span class="foreign i">critica delle varianti</span>), French genetic criticism and the
     Anglo-American tradition of textual bibliography.<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e126">[1]</a> Each one of these traditions have developed, since the beginning of
     the 20th century, different critical instruments and approaches; however they all seem to share
     a common idea: a literary work (and in general every "script act") can be regarded not
     merely as a product, but as the result of a dynamic process of interaction between several
     factors and influences of a linguistic, cultural and social nature.<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e161">[2]</a> This
     attention to processes is also studied in pragmatics [<a class="ref" href="#austin1976">Austin 1976</a>], whose
     contribution to the study of textual fluidity has been explicitly recognised in the
     text-critical domain in a recent article by Peter Shillingsburg <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#shillingsburg2006">#shillingsburg2006</a></span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e181">[3]</a> Although there is no room here to investigate the pragmatic aspects of
     autographic writing, it is obvious that the typical illocutory and dialogic nature of the
     textual and graphic-semantic elements of the <span class="foreign i">avant-texte</span>
     constitutes a relatively fertile area for pragmatic analysis.<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e190">[4]</a> The <span class="foreign i">avant-texte</span> is a
      <em class="emph">communicative system</em>: the signs on the manuscript page are primarily
     interpretations of "actions," and the dialogue involves the author not only as a subject
     in multiple roles (author/reader, author/corrector, author/critic, etc.), but also in
     triangular relations such as editor/author/editor as in the case of proof-editing.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">One of the main issues that emerged from our encoding experiment can also be formulated as a
     question: can the multidimensional and pragmatic nature of different writing stages/sketches be
     represented with the help of digital instruments? As we will see, a tentative answer to this
     question leads to the admission that any transformation from paper to bits, apart from leading
     to certain developments, all potentially "intrusive" for the document, is no ordinary
     event, nor is it technically neutral. The first stage is the conversion of the textual content
     and structure of the original document into digital form. This process, far from representing a
     simple copying of a document from one medium to another, is actually a hermeneutic and semiotic
     process, for in the moment in which a text is transcribed through the selection and the use of
     markup this creates meaning in itself. It is also a pragmatic process, since markup is not only
     able to represent but also to <em class="emph">create</em> actions [<a class="ref" href="#renear2005">Renear 2005</a>, 28].
     In the words of one of the Italian pioneers of humanities computing:</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">We must understand and keep in mind that at the moment of data entry the
      text (the entire quantity of information contained within it) is being entrusted to a
      different channel from that in which it has survived until now (if one of the elements of the
      system of communication changes, the others necessarily change as well). We must also always
      remember that transcription is in any case an interpretative act that manifests itself at the
      very moment in which we take any decision: from the simplest — is this element a full stop,
      the end of an abbreviation or a dash? – to the more complex — is this other case a verse, a
      single verse on two printed lines, or two verses? [<a class="ref" href="#gigliozzi1998">Gigliozzi 1998</a>, 228]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Such "decisions" imply a perspective, a selection of aspects, a method of analysis and a
     choice of an encoding model, to arrive at a representation of the text out of so many
     possibilities — an encoding that we realize through a markup language permits us to formally
     describe the structure of a text, and to analyze the data in depth. Its utility will be in
     proportion to how much information it can set out, include and preserve. However, it will not
     be possible, and would hardly be desirable, to represent all aspects an ideal reader would see
     in a text. The printing bias has forced us to think of a text as a stable product, but if we
     either look at the different historical representations of a given text or at its documented
     writing stages, we realize that there is not one text, but many texts, as many as there are
     mechanisms of writing, material production, intertextual paths and methodologies of
     reconstruction.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Nowadays the most powerful device for the representation and digital analysis of literary
     texts is XML (Extensible Markup Language), which provides a rigorous syntax for representing
     the deep structure of a text. XML is a metalanguage, that is to say a system for defining tags
     that describe the role played by every element within a text. Apart from technical advantages
     (portability, standardisation, flexibility, representational power) markup languages have been
     credited with allowing the scholar to make his own interpretation of the text more explicit
      [<a class="ref" href="#ciotti2005">Ciotti 2005</a>, 9–42].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Of course, markup languages, like any other technological instrument, are not perfect. They
     impose a hierarchical structure, which is normally used as a container for the text.<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e233">[5]</a> This can lead to
     major difficulties in cases where the text cannot be reduced to such a structure. The
      "well-formedness" of XML, the requirement that every element, except for the document
     root, must be contained in some other element, gives the text an explicit and unambiguous
     structure. This principle is in contrast with what Buzzetti defines as the "dynamic instability of literary texts" [<a class="ref" href="#buzzetti2002">Buzzetti 2002</a>]. A number of recent papers have underlined the seriousness of the problems that such
     dynamic instability poses for XML markup. For example, [<a class="ref" href="#vetter2003">Vetter and McDonald 2003</a>] explore the
     main techniques for recording variants taken from the TEI Guidelines, as well as several ad hoc
     methods for interlinking them in the poetry of Emily Dickinson. They conclude rather negatively
     that no method for recording Dickinson’s variants proves to be "entirely satisfactory" [<a class="ref" href="#vetter2003">Vetter and McDonald 2003</a>, 151]. [<a class="ref" href="#vanhoutte2006">Vanhoutte 2006</a>] likewise, in applying modern encoding techniques to
     record the variation of the manuscript antecedents of a classic Flemish novel, remarks, "The modern manuscript shows a much more complicated web of interwoven and
      overlapping relationships of elements and structures" [than the printed book]. And
     although not a case of a modern manuscript, [<a class="ref" href="#bart2006">Bart 2006</a>] describes the problems of
     encoding variation in the Ht manuscript of Piers Plowman, such as variation in line numbering
     and the encoding of variants between physical versions, for which the author had often to
     resort to "the shameless application of technical duct tape."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Specific cases can always be dismissed as anomalies, but these problems appear to be serious
     enough to warrant further investigation. Since we work on modern manuscripts, and on
     visualising the encoding of such texts, we are interested in discovering whether the <cite class="title italic">Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines</cite> (TEI) are in fact sufficient to
     encode modern manuscript material. Investigation of specific cases does have the advantage of
     providing a wealth of fine detail that can’t be derived from purely theoretical or technical
     investigations.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The TEI offers a rich collection of guidelines, originally for the encoding of ancient texts,
     although in later editions it has included specific guidelines for the textual phenomena of
     modern and contemporary texts [<a class="ref" href="#burnard2007">Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007</a>, Ch. 11]. The encoding of these
     elements, which Vanhoutte calls the "temporal unity" of writing, is
     often problematic [<a class="ref" href="#vanhoutte2003">Vanhoutte 2003</a>, 12] or "very complicated, if not impossible" [<a class="ref" href="#pierazzo2007">Pierazzo 2007</a>, 151]. Any movement of the text <em class="emph">forwards</em> or <em class="emph">backwards</em> in time (cf.
     below § 2.3) naturally tends to generate overlapping structures. However, the spatial dimension
     can also represent a problem: we need only think of modern poetic texts, in which it is often
     very difficult to recover the structure of a composition in strophes and verses. The following
     paragraphs are an attempt to confront these clashes of theory and practice via a case study:
     the encoding of three compositions and their various writing phases by the Italian poet and
     writer Valerio Magrelli.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">2. TEI-XML Encoding of the Poetry of Valerio Magrelli</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Our encoding experiment focuses on the three poems ("Molto sottrae il
      sonno alla vita,""Essere matita è segreta ambizione,""Ecco la lunga palpebra della donna") written between 1975 and 1979,
     which then appeared in the first section ("Rima palpebralis") of the
     anthology <cite class="title italic">Ora serrate retinae</cite> edited by Feltrinelli in 1980.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">For each poem we have been able to access and scan the author’s original version, which in
     its natural state <span class="foreign i">in fieri</span> poses the most important and
     significant problems of representation. There are also further typewritten versions, gathered
     and <em class="emph">recatalogued</em> by the author in various notebooks,<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e325">[6]</a> in which we find again the strong presence of
     textual variation, the definitive printed edition and in some cases a printed version in
     French. The author continued to edit his own texts until the appearance of the printed version,
     but our work is concentrated on the first two stages of the process of writing the three poems
     mentioned above: the two autographs of the first two poems ("Molto sottrae
      il sonno alla vita" and "Essere matita è segreta ambizione")
     and two typescripts with corrections in the author’s hand in the case of the third ("Ecco la lunga palpebra della donna").<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e340">[7]</a></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">2.1 Space and Time. Encoding of the Autograph of "Molto sottrae il
       sonno alla vita"</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">In our encoding we have tried to represent the movement of writing, whose intention was to
      produce, by each new editorial action and variation, a new text and a new context. As Allen
      Renear noted [<a class="ref" href="#renear2005">Renear 2005</a>], it is possible to apply the categories of pragmatic
      analysis, and in particular the notion of illucotory acts, to better analyse and define the
      scope and specific uses of markup. As will be seen, we are forced to use markup to favour the
      illocutory force of the author’s own text (its dialogic-contextual dimension) rather than
      limit ourselves to recording phenomena in a sequential and, as it were, "external"
      fashion. In philological terms this means that after a process, here outlined, consisting of
      sketches, proofs and discards, we have decided to favour the diachronic aspect, establishing
      different phases of writing and rewriting, and emphasising the significance of the author’s
      interaction with the text. As a result, since the choice of encoding is never neutral, either
      the graphical aspect of the page or the synchronic actions of writing will be sacrificed. Also
      because, as we noted above, as a result of the limits imposed by the instruments of encoding,
      often the simultaneous representation of both aspects becomes excessively difficult if not
      absolutely impossible.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The <cite class="title italic">TEI Guidelines,</cite> version P5,<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e361">[8]</a> produced by [<a class="ref" href="#burnard2007">Burnard &amp; Bauman 2007</a>], is
      available in the form of several customised modules such as Drama and MS. These contain a
      selection of various parts of the overall Guidelines and help reduce the complexity and size
      of the tagset. The TEI also provides specific elements for the representation of poetic texts.
      The basic plan is the following:</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12"><blockquote class="eg"><pre><tt>

      this model (which is more applicable to the representation of non-contemporary poetry),
      primarily because the author’s originals in this case don’t always contain an explicit
      division into verses, which was often added by the author at a later time or not at all; and
      secondly because this subdivision is itself subject to alteration and hence must be considered
      as part of the phenomenon of textual variation.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">We see here the first example of the complexity of the textual phenomena from the encoding

       a succession of events. It was immediately noticed (fortunately for us) that the original
       layers of correction could be identified by the use of two colors: a red pen for the first
       draft ("Il sonno è l'indiscreto ospite // irresistibile") and a
       blue pen for corrections and additions ("&lt;E&gt; si allarga &lt;nel
        corpo&gt; come un secondo corpo intollerabile..."). As we will see later, thanks to
       the use of color we can discern with certainty at least four successive stages of corrections
       by the author, assuming they were carried out at different times.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Since we regarded the rigid division into line-groups (<span class="monospace">&lt;lg&gt;</span>) and verses
        (<span class="monospace">&lt;l&gt;</span>) as inadequate, we initially marked the end of each “typographic”
       line with the empty element <span class="monospace">&lt;lb/&gt;</span> (line break) and, since it was
       impossible to consider this as a suitable mark for a strophic unit, we enclosed a group of
       verses or the text of the autograph in general within a generic element
        <span class="monospace">&lt;ab&gt;</span> (anonymous block). In addition, we also marked the end of the poetic
       verse with another empty element <span class="monospace">&lt;milestone/&gt;</span>, qualified by an attribute
        <span class="monospace">unit="verse"</span>. Here is the result of the first attempt:</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17"><blockquote class="eg"><pre><tt>

       pen ("è l’indiscreto ospite // irresistibile") crosses the end of

       even the more generic <span class="monospace">&lt;seg&gt;verse&lt;/seg&gt;</span> to represent the verse unit,

       and <span class="monospace">&lt;lb/&gt;</span> resolves the problem of overlap, it also generates a redundancy.
       These elements in fact fulfil the same function: both mark the end of a portion of text
       without qualifying it as belonging to either. This poses a problem whenever the two elements
       refer at the same moment to a common piece of text.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Even though it is possible to represent the author’s own substitutions, deletions and

       (deletion), this choice of markup cannot represent the chronological sequence of corrections.
       For example, it doesn’t take into account the fact that the initial verse extends onto two
       lines (although it is one unit), or the subdivision of the initial verse into two, after
         <span class="foreign i">"nel corpo/"</span> was added, or the subsequent introduction of a
       metrical structure (the subdivision into verses indicated by Magrelli’s use of the forward
       slash <span class="hi italic">/</span>). In the proposed encoding the state of the metrical scheme
       was regarded as already decided: the insertion of the metrical structure is anticipated and
       reshaped by the editor, when in reality it happens at a later point in the process. Also, by
       this selection we lose important information concerning the relations between the author’s
       interventions and their order. In conclusion, it is not possible to represent both phenomena:
       the metrical (spatial) structure and that of the (temporal) variation, without violating the
       syntax of XML. And in the case of the other canto it would perhaps not be appropriate to
       speak of the typographical design of the page for an object like a manuscript, which is not
       strictly speaking a publication.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">The autograph is in fact considered as an open semiotic system, a "field of action" [<a class="ref" href="#ferrer2002">Ferrer 2002</a>, 52] interdependent on its various possible concrete realizations (among which are printed

       critical apparatus of a manuscript, merging the elements defined in chapters 11 and 12 of the
       TEI Guidelines.<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e499">[11]</a> An apparatus is usually understood as an instrument that records
       the sequence of variants between multiple texts, whereas here it is used to represent the
       variants within a single manuscript. In our case then we have represented textual variation
       with the <span class="monospace">&lt;app&gt;</span> (apparatus) tag which, instead of recording, as in its
       standard use, variants from several manuscripts, here contains the different stages of
       composition of a single text (our fragment). Each phrase is represented by the tag
        <span class="monospace">&lt;rdg&gt;</span> (reading), qualified with a <span class="monospace">varseq</span> attribute (variant
       sequence), which in its turn supplies a number to indicate the sequence. After having
       identified the various levels of stratification in the text, which occur uniformly throughout
       the autograph, we assigned a successive number to each reading via the attribute
        <span class="monospace">varseq</span>. The number indicates the stage of intervention, according to our
       interpretation, to which the segment of text contained there belongs. As will be seen, in
       keeping with our intentions, we will represent both the stages of the writing process and the

       which identifies that segment as a verse unit that we have reconstructed. Examination of the
       whole autograph reveals four stages: the red biro represents the first form given to the
       composition by its author, and what may be the second stage consists of the author’s
       interventions — deletions, rewritings and corrections — with the same implement. The use of
       the blue pen indicates a later stage, the third, followed by corrections on top with the same
       instrument (fourth stage). In the chosen fragment <a href="#figure01">Figure 01</a>,
       however, only three stages are visible: the first, the third and the fourth.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">The initial verse is thus the following: <blockquote><p>1. <span class="foreign i">Il

        <span class="foreign i">"nel corpo/"</span> and the introduction of a metrical
       structure (the character <span class="hi italic">/</span> indicates the end of a verse): <blockquote><p>4. <span class="foreign i">E il sonno si allarga nel corpo / come un secondo //
         corpo intollerabile /</span></p></blockquote> In the encoding, we have chosen to represent not
       only the actions of the author and hence the physical data (cancellation, rewriting,
       insertion of elements which subdivide the verse unit) but also the consequences of these
       actions (the first portion of text is substituted by another, forming a new verse; this is
       turn undergoes variation to form two new verses). Then, by eliminating the empty milestone
       element and inserting the <span class="monospace">&lt;seg type="l"&gt;</span> tag, we make one reconstruction
       of the verse explicit, while marking the end of the typographic line with

       interpretation of the process of writing, but they do not account for the external aspect of
       the autograph. And from the point of view of a palaeographer or an archivist, this would be a
       serious loss of information. Insofar as our proposed encoding can be revised, perfected and
       extended, we find ourselves facing the central theoretical crux of the representation of
       digital documents: encoding has the virtue of requiring us to explain and justify our
       choices, but at the same time this assumption of responsibility (useful and correct in the
       eyes of the scientific community) declares, as it were, its epistemic limit: not all

      a subsequent addition, or by examining the spatial elements, such as the place where the
      author puts the added text. But such interpretations are insufficient to interpret and encode
      the process of composition. In the autograph of <cite class="title italic">Ecco la lunga palpebra
       della donna</cite>, we are faced with words that are cancelled and substituted not by
      another word but by two different ones, by additions above the line (supralinear) or below the
      line (sublinear). In the fragment of the poem that we chose to examine <a href="#figure02">Figure 02</a> the text is spread over five lines (which we shall only call verses by the
      laws of post hoc), and is rich in intratextual and pragmatic phenomena of both the textual and
      graphical kinds (e.g. arrows, marks of emphasis, cross references etc.) In particular the
      adjectives were subject to close attention by the author and could be reduced to two lists of
      variants, which Magrelli drew up within the autograph (of which one is visible in <a href="#figure02">Figure 02</a>: the four adjectives written in the bottom right in capitals).</div><div id="figure02" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/1/000082/..../000082/resources/figure02.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/4/1/000082/..../000082/resources/figure02.jpg" alt=""/></a></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">As can be seen, the adjectives <span class="foreign i">stupito, perplesso</span> and

      subsequently and could be considered as the two variants parallel in time to <span class="foreign i">perplesso.</span> For this reason we have considered them as a list of
      variants within the line, whose chronological succession we will not attempt to reconstruct.
      Immediately following this are two other variants, <span class="foreign i">canta</span> and

      the author attached a particular importance to them, circling or underlining them. To render
      this emphasis we have used the <span class="monospace">&lt;emph&gt;</span> tag, giving it a <span class="monospace">rend</span>
      attribute which explains what type it is (circled or underlined). The encoding of the fourth
      verse (lines 39-70) presents one solution to a complex set of interrelationships among
      elements in various areas of the autograph. Subsequently, probably during the insertion of
        <span class="foreign i">nasce il canto,</span> the author inserted an arrow,
      which refers to a list of four adjectives written in capitals at the foot of the page (<a href="#figure02">Figure 02</a>, bottom left). This type of indication can be interpreted as an
       "action" of the author directed towards producing certain effects — but not results,
      because the author is, in a certain sense, also engaged in a dialog with himself. To record
      this dialectic we have chosen to represent the arrow with a note, via the metatextual
       <span class="monospace">&lt;note&gt;</span> element (line 44), giving it the attribute
       <span class="monospace">type="arrow"</span>, and inserting it in the text containing a list of the adjectives
      as alternatives (each distinguished from the others by <span class="monospace">&lt;item&gt;</span>). Since we
      maintain that the list/note of four adjectives was inserted during the second draft, we assign
      it to the second version (<span class="monospace">&lt;rdg varSeq="2"&gt;</span>). In the facsimile the arrow is
      joined to the o of <span class="foreign i">[nasce il] canto</span> (added above
      the fourth line of the autograph). In summary, our reading of the fourth verse treats the
      variants within the text as components (<span class="monospace">&lt;item&gt;</span>s) of a list
       (<span class="monospace">&lt;list&gt;</span>), which we connect back to a collection of alternatives placed by
      the author at the foot of the page. Obviously, this solution, which thus inverts the spatial
      distribution of the elements in relation to how they are presented in the autograph (the list
      occurs at the end of the fifth verse and not within the fourth as in the encoding), is one
      possible workaround for representing such complex phenomena. This is a further example of how
      encoding of the writing process can imply, through the remodelling/reconstruction brought
      about by markup languages, the overturning of the spatial dimension. In other words, what
      appears in the material reality of the document as a particular region, determined visually,
      in the pragmatic dimension of the process may be located on several temporal levels. Since to
      encode means to select one point of view, in our case we are forced to represent, through the
      linear instruments of markup, something which is not linear by its very nature. This is a
      dimension which the author indicates "performatively" through signals that are not
      exclusively textual, as if to show that the dimension of the process cannot be cognitively
      reduced to a hierachical sequence.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">2.3 Backwards in Time: Encoding of <cite class="title italic">Essere matita è segreta

      emphasize the genetic aspect, representing the writing phases from A0 (no longer in material

      succession without taking account of the writing phases. We chose the second of these two
      options for our proposed encoding, although we also decided to highlight the temporal sequence
      by inserting an editorial note at the point where the correction occurs and so establish a
      link with the second photocopied version, explaining that the correction is subsequent to the

     of the writing process by means of the TEI-XML Guidelines. The term <em class="term">epistemology of
      variation</em>,<a class="noteRef" href="#d33848e905">[14]</a> invoked here for the first time, may help to express what
     is at stake in this representation: not simply an account of evidence whose significance begins
     and ends with the data, but an account of a system of knowledge in which the relation between
     states is as important as any state taken alone. As already mentioned, markup languages appear
     to be — at the moment — the most flexible scientific and economical solution for the
     representation of digital text. However, as already explained, it would be naive and probably
     counterproductive to claim that we are satisfied. Many (but not all) of the phenomena described
     here can be represented only with great effort or with an unacceptable level of imprecision.
     XML, like its predecessor SGML, was originally designed as an instrument for archiving and
     information retrieval, whereas the <span class="foreign i">mouvance</span> of the text poses
     challenges for the encoding and representation that can only be resolved by the development of
     a different model of encoding, and by the design of an adequate user interface on the
     application level. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that without an adequate theoretical
     reflection on text in the digital era no instrument can offer satisfying solutions. The variant
     is "complex stratified knowledge" [<a class="ref" href="#benozzo2004">Benozzo 2004</a>, 52] which embodies an epistemological and cultural status. In fact, variation, from
     evolutionary biology [<a class="ref" href="#edelman2006">Edelman 2006</a>] to cognitive anthropology [<a class="ref" href="#sperber1996">Sperber 1996</a>], is at the heart of the phenomena and processes of diffusion of
     culture. In other words, a certain degree of instability is immanent to the transmission of
     knowledge. Variation therefore calls into question the notion of "repeatability," an
     important concept in disciplines concerned with the transmission of information — including
     philology. The "failure to repeat" [<a class="ref" href="#ferrer2002">Ferrer 2002</a>, 52] is thus an annoying spanner in the conceptual works of any procedure based on recursive
     structures. This happens because the variant, understood as a symptom of the processual (rather
     than the editorial) dimension is an "equally valid alternative," which does not expect the
     attainment of "truth." The new epistemological law revealed to us by the dynamics of the
     writing process is part of the actual paradigm-shift which concerns the sciences of language,
     where it emerges as a dialectic between the concept of "system" and that of "process"
     (or in our case between text and writing):</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">Of particular interest appears to be the recent deepening of the notion of
       "process," which emerges in a separate but convergent manner from the study of phonetics
      and phonology, and from morphology and syntax ... These results converge towards a vision that
      is much more complex and empirically founded on the problem of the linearity of linguistic
      phenomena, showing that at each level of analysis global planes come into play behind the
      apparent seriality of linguistic production. ... One significant consequence of the creation
      of these new methods is that they succeed in reducing interest in the notion of process to the
      second level to the benefit of the notion of process. [<a class="ref" href="#sornicola2005">Sornicola 2005</a>, 37]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Even though it is always risky to propose analogies, this epistemological turn can be
     compared to that "second phase" in the history of physics, which is the subject of the
     work of the chemist and epistemologist Ilya Prigogine. For Prigogine post-Newtonian physics,
     having discovered disequilibrium, ceased to describe phenomena in terms of stability and
     uniformity, as Boltzmann had done, construing a model — whose results echo those of the forest
     of "bifid trees" discovered by Bédier — "from
      the irreversible evolution of the population of particles towards a state of
      equilibrium," which has the effect of describing, exactly as Bédier noted on the
     subject of the tradition of the <cite class="title italic">Lai de l’ombre</cite> (Bédier 1929-1985), "an evolution towards uniformity" [<a class="ref" href="#pregogine1988">Prigogine &amp; Stengers 1988</a>, 25–26]. At the centre of Prigogine’s argument is the accusation directed against Newtonian
     physics that it ignores time: "...opposed to dynamic eternity is the second
      principle of thermodynamics... Physics was finally able to describe, like the other sciences,
      a world open to history." The second phase of physics "is that of
      the instability of the elementary particles and their complexity"; subsequently he adds "the discovery of structures not in equilibrium, which overturns the dogma
       that assimilates the growth of entropy to molecular disorder" [<a class="ref" href="#pregogine1988">Prigogine &amp; Stengers 1988</a>, 44]. This "non-equilibrium" greatly resembles the notion of process developed and
     analysed in various areas of the humanities: "If one can say, <span class="hi italic"><span class="foreign i">a posteriori</span></span>,
       that this second period has seen the discovery of a world of processes of creation, far
       removed from the correct world of eternal laws, which characterised the ideal of classical
       physics" [<a class="ref" href="#pregogine1988">Prigogine &amp; Stengers 1988</a>, 44]. The analogy could continue, for example, by noting that the philological concept of
      "original text" presupposes a dismissal of time, establishing a principle of
     reversability: apart from certain effects (the tradition) it is always possible to jump back to
     the cause (the original). But in both cases — in the physics of Boltzman and the philology of
     Lachmann — to go back to the cause is a metaphysical undertaking: texts and elementary
     particles are both ascribed to a world which cannot be interpreted or represented in
     genealogical terms or by following rigid principles of causality.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">Applied to our case, that is, the representation and use of digital text, this vision of

        and can be reproduced via digital "simulations"; but the structures of a document (the
        product) can be either material or abstract: the trace left on the page is a material fact,
        but the insertion of a title, the start of a new paragraph, the insertion of a note etc.
        exist as categories and as models which from time to time take concrete form in situations
        and expressions. As showed in researches that span from authorial medieval manuscripts [<a class="ref" href="#barolini2007">Barolini &amp; Storey 2007</a>] up to contemporary editions [<a class="ref" href="#giuliani2006">Giuliani 2006</a>], the
        text is the result of these material and abstract interacting forces, which are always
        mutually influencing one another.</div><div class="endnote" id="d33848e1019"><span class="noteRef">[16]</span>We are
        adapting to the domain of textual fluidity a formulation suggested by the second generation
        of cognitive linguists and expressed primarily in opposition to dualistic and formal
        approaches to language. According to cognitive linguist Langacker [<a class="ref" href="#langacker1987">Langacker 1987-1991</a>] language cannot be considered a module separated from other
        mental activities and operations (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#formigari2001">Formigari 2001</a>, 271]). In applying
        this conceptual model to the text, we could say that the abstract, material and procedural
        aspects of writing are all responsible for building the "meaning" of the
       text.</div></div><div id="worksCited"><h2>Works Cited</h2><div class="bibl fallback"><span class="ref" id="austin1976"><!-- close -->Austin 1976</span> Austin, J.L. <cite class="title italic">How to do things
