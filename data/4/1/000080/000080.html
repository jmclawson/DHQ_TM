            and there is more and more talk about a broadly conceived, inclusive digital humanities.
            The field is expanding and at the same time being negotiated, and this article explores
            the idea of a broadly conceived landscape of digital humanities in some depth. It is
            argued that awareness across this landscape is important to the future of the field. The
            study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a "flythrough" of the
            landscape, and a discussion of what being a digital humanist entails. The second part is
            an exploration of four concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology can help chart and understand the digital humanities. The modes of engagement analyzed are technology as a tool, study object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Over the last five years, there has been a surge of activity in the multifarious emerging field often referred to as "digital humanities." Of course, humanities-based engagement with information technology is not new, but we are now seeing a rich multi-level interaction with the "digital" that is partly a result of the persuasiveness of digital technology and the sheer number of disciplines, perspectives and approaches involved. Humanists are exploring differing modes of engagement, institutional models, technologies and discursive strategies. There is also a strategy-level push for the digital humanities which, among other things, affects university research strategies, external funding and recruitment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This is the second article in a four-part series exploring the intersection of the humanities and the digital. In the first article, I examined the discursive transition from humanities computing to digital humanities, looking at how this naming is related to shifts in institutional, disciplinary, and social organization. I also addressed the epistemic culture and commitments of humanities computing, and tensions between this tradition and a broad notion of digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">In the current article, I start out from a broad notion of the digital humanities
                that is sometimes suggested but rarely analyzed in more detail. The landscape of
                digital humanities is explored more broadly through a "fly-through" critical overview of the landscape and an exploration of four concrete encounters. I argue that a better understanding of the landscape of the digital humanities is vital to the continued growth and consolidation of the field, and necessary to meet a range of exciting upcoming challenges. Importantly, acknowledging internal variation and tensions are critical to this enterprise, and it seems likely that the way forward is neither a singular vision of a unified, homogenous digital humanities nor extensive fragmentation and lack of shared awareness and common visions. It is suggested that one way of understanding and acknowledging the different traditions and epistemic commitments of the digital humanities is to consider different modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology. The third part of the article consequently offers an in-depth analysis of some paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology. I feel this approach will give a better sense of the breadth and depth of the field, different implementations, and points of connections and divergence. Further, I argue that a better understanding of the landscape of the digital humanities is vital to the continued growth and consolidation of the field, and necessary to meet a range of exciting upcoming challenges.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The third article discusses cyberinfrastructure for the humanities and digital
                humanities more broadly, and presents a case study from HUMlab at Umeå University in
                Sweden. In the fourth and final article, I explore the multiple ways in which the
                digital humanities have been envisioned and how the digital humanities can often
                become a laboratory and means for thinking about the state and future of the
                humanities at large. I conclude by presenting a tentative visionary space for the future of the digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The article series as a whole traces the digital humanities as a project in terms of history, epistemic commitments, modes of engagement with the digital, conceptual foundations for associated cyberinfrastructure, visions and hope invested, as well as future directions for the field, and necessarily, for the humanities at large.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Outline</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">This article is divided into three main parts that present different perspectives or lenses on the landscape of the digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The first part provides a territorial fly-through (critical overview) of the landscape of the digital humanities that discusses ways of "reading" the territory as well as specific parts of the terrain. The picture given is broad, but also fairly particular in relation to specific initiatives and associated discourses. Typologies of the digital humanities are discussed, as well as what it might entail to be a digital humanist. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The second part of the paper presents four personal encounters with digital humanities initiatives that occurred between 2001 and 2009.

                information technology: information technology as a tool, an object of study, an
                exploratory laboratory, an expressive medium and an activist venue. The first three
                modes of engagement are given most attention. This analytical model provides one possible way of charting the territory of the digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Necessarily, any attempt at charting a large and indeterminate field such as digital
                humanities cannot be all-inclusive. The focus in the following exposition is large
                structures as well as particular examples, but the reader will find neither detailed
                accounts of specific fields such as computer mediated communication or history and
                computing, nor of associated fields such as technoscience (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#ihde2003">Ihde &amp; Selinger 2003</a>]) with which there is some overlap.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3669e119">[1]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Together, the fly-through, the encounters and the analytical framework will help garner a better understanding of the field of digital humanities. The mapping activity itself is as important as the resultant patchy map, however, and it is argued that the challenges and possibilities ahead call for a shared awareness and rich collaborations across the landscape of the digital humanities.

                    in a loose sense. This is not to suggest a well-defined and delimited academic
                    field outside of the traditional humanities disciplines, but rather an inclusive notion that will allow us to talk about different kinds of initiatives and activities in the intersection between the humanities and information technology or the digital. It is claimed that this conversation can be quite important to further and consolidate digitally inflected work in the humanities. This does not mean, however, that the ultimate goal necessarily is an all-inclusive digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Any attempt at mapping a field such as the digital humanities will naturally be a particular reading and interpretation of that field. We will start by surveying a few suggested typologies for the digital humanities.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Typologies of the Digital Humanities</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">In a 2008 talk [<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2008">McPherson 2008</a>] and subsequent article <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2009a">#mcpherson2009a</a></span>, Tara
                    McPherson suggested a typology for the digital humanities that makes
                    distinctions between the computing humanities, blogging humanities and
                    multimodal humanities. According to McPherson, the computing humanities focus on
                    building tools, infrastructure, standards and collections whereas the blogging
                    humanities are concerned with the production of networked media and peer-to-peer
                    writing. The multimodal humanities bring together scholarly tools, databases,
                    networked writing and peer-to-peer commentary while also leveraging the
                    potential of the visual and aural media that are part of contemporary life. This
                    is a useful typology in that it is comprehensive, simple and points to the
                    importance of networked media and writing as well as describes an ongoing
                    development. It does not privilege nor explicitly single out the digital as an
                    object of analysis, which partly may be a result of a more general focus on
                    multimodal writing in the humanities at large, and arguably the most prominent
                    mode of engagement for the multimodal humanities is the digital as an expressive
                    medium. While the additive element of this typology is useful, we should be
                    aware of the complexities of some of these issues. For instance, the tools used
                    by computing humanists are probably very different from most of the tools used
                    by multimodal humanists. As we have seen in the earlier analysis of humanities
                    computing as digital humanities <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#svensson2009a">#svensson2009a</a></span>, the epistemic
                    commitments and conventions of a tradition cannot easily be subsumed in another
                    type of digital humanities (cf. also [<a class="ref" href="#ratto2006">Ratto 2006</a>]).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">Along somewhat similar lines, [<a class="ref" href="#davidson2008">Davidson 2008</a>] identifies two
                    phases of digital humanities — Humanities 1.0 and Humanities 2.0 — making use of
                    the distinction between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. For instance, she says, "Humanities 2.0 is distinguished from monumental,
                        first-generation, data-based projects not just by its interactivity but also
                        by openness about participation grounded in a different set of theoretical
                        premises, which decenter knowledge and authority" [<a class="ref" href="#davidson2008">Davidson 2008</a>, 711–12]. Davidson presents a well-articulated vision for the humanities where  technology is a key participant in the decentering of authorship, credentialing practices, reward systems, interdisciplinarity, and collaboration. The argument extends far beyond technology and basically concerns the situation and future for the humanities more generally:
                    
                    <blockquote><p>In a time of paradigm shifts, moral and political treachery, historical amnesia, and psychic and spiritual turmoil, humanistic issues are central — if only funding agencies, media interests, and we humanists ourselves will recognize the momentousness of this era for our discipline and take seriously the need for our intellectual centrality. [<a class="ref" href="#davidson2008">Davidson 2008</a>, 715]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Both McPherson and Davidson point to a transition from humanities computing or
                    computing humanities to multimodal humanities or humanities 2.0 (cf. also the
                    Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0 and the distinction between a first
                    and second wave of digital humanities work). The endpoint can be interpreted as
                    a current and forward-looking variety of the digital humanities. There is a
                    clear assumption of change and trajectory here, and a risk that different
                    epistemic traditions and goals are conflated in this trajectory. In practice, it
                    would seem that humanities computing (even if called digital humanities) will
                    not — at least not fully or anytime soon — become the multimodal humanities or
                    humanities 2.0 envisioned in these articles. However, as both writers show, the
                    intersection between these traditions is a productive and important one.
                    Importantly, while there is a great deal of ongoing collaboration and identification of common goals, we need to be aware of the fact that we are concerned with several epistemic traditions and visions. It could be argued that there is a need for an expanded, multi-layered discussion of visions, collaborative possibilities, and possibly but not necessarily, an articulated convergent path forward.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Another mode of analysis is provided by Hayles ([<a class="ref" href="#haylesa">Hayles Forthcoming PLMA</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#haylesb">Hayles Forthcoming Chapter</a>]) who manifests her intellectual curiosity for the field through identification of pivotal theoretical and methodological issues as well as through interviews with 17 digital humanists. Among issues identified and discussed are scalability, reading, algorithmic analysis, visualization and open review. Two digital humanities environments, the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at King’s College and the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture at Georgia Tech, function as case studies, and add to the analysis partly through their differentness. Hayles identifies two different strategies for promoting a digital humanities agenda: assimilation and distinction. According to Hayles, assimilation extends existing scholarship into digital domains whereas distinction emphasizes new methodologies, novel research questions, and the emergence of new fields. When she discusses the outcomes of different models, she points to the risk of divergence: 
                    
                    <blockquote><p>The kinds of articulation that emerge have strong implications for the future: will the Digital Humanities become a separate field whose interests are increasingly remote from the Traditional Humanities, or will it on the contrary become so deeply entwined with questions of hermeneutic interpretation that no self-respecting Traditional scholar could remain ignorant of its results?  If the Digital Humanities were to spin off into an entirely separate field, the future trajectory of the Traditional Humanities would be affected as well.  Obviously, this is a political as well as an intellectual issue.  In the case of radical divergence (which I think would be a tragic mistake), one might expect turf battles, competition for funding, changing disciplinary boundaries, and shifting academic prestige. [<a class="ref" href="#haylesa">Hayles Forthcoming PLMA</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Interestingly, Hayles brings up questions of the disciplinary status of digital
                    humanities that have generated much discussion and debate over the years (cf.
                    <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#svensson2009a">#svensson2009a</a></span>). This history is partly one of continuous
                    tension between the disciplines and various forms of digital humanities, and
                    given this fairly long track record (especially for humanities computing) and
                    the current multiplexity of the field, it seems quite unlikely that the digital
                    humanities would ever become a fully separate field.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3669e180">[3]</a> What is likely, in any
                    case, is continued tension, and "occasional turf battles,
                        competition for funding, changing disciplinary boundaries and shifting
                        academic prestige." Arguably, disunification can bring stability to a
                    disciplinary area such as digital humanities (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#galison1997">Galison 1997</a>, 781–2]). Furthermore, fights within disciplines can be seen as a way
                    to maintain "intellectual vibrancy" [<a class="ref" href="#sterne2005">Sterne 2005</a>, 251].</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">The Diverse Territory of Digital Humanities</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">The complexity of digital humanities as a "field" comes partly from its

                    the digital humanities, Bell notes that the "'field' of
                        cyberculture (or whatever) studies is diverse and heterodox, too

The question is whether it even constitutes a field. This is the position taken in the Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0 (2009):
                    
                    <blockquote><p>Digital Humanities is not a unified field but <em class="emph">an array of convergent practices</em> that explore a universe in which: a) print is no longer the exclusive or the normative medium in which knowledge is produced and/or disseminated; instead, print finds itself absorbed into new, multimedia configurations; and b) digital tools, techniques, and media have altered the production and dissemination of knowledge in the arts, human and social sciences.

                    <blockquote><p>Digital humanities is a diverse and still emerging field that encompasses the practice of humanities research in and through information technology, and the exploration of how the humanities may evolve through their engagement with technology, media, and computational methods. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dhq2010a">#dhq2010a</a></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">The "still" in "still emerging" seems to indicate that the field has been

                    In the case of humanities computing, there was already the sense of an established field with journals, conferences and people primarily engaged in the field. This is not to say that everyone engaged in humanities computing (or humanities computing as digital humanities) would describe it as a field, but there is a fairly general consensus and a strong tradition. The following quote, from the introduction of the <cite class="title italic">Blackwell Companion to the Digital Humanities</cite>, illustrates the somewhat ambivalent interrelation between humanities computing and digital humanities, and also shows how the two "fields" can coexist. 
                    
                    <blockquote><p>The digital humanities, then, and their interdisciplinary core found in the field of humanities computing, have a long and dynamic history best illustrated by examination of the locations at which specific disciplinary practices intersect with computation. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#schreibman2004">#schreibman2004</a></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Under this reading, humanities computing provides the core whereas digital
                    humanities presumably also includes the disciplines. As I have shown earlier
                    <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#svensson2009a">#svensson2009a</a></span>, the problem may be the conflation that results from making the history of humanities computing into the history of digital humanities. In any case, the strength of humanities computing as a field partly comes from the epistemic investment in technology as tool and associated processes (ranging from metadata schemes to project management), and as we have seen earlier, it can be argued that this epistemic commitment often leads to a relatively weak link to the disciplines (beyond the purely instrumental).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">An alternative focus on technology or the digital as study object, however, may
                    lead to a weaker sense of the field of digital humanities — exactly because of the tight relation between the traditional discipline and the digitally inflected study object. The study object would probably also tend to be aligned with the epistemic commitments of an established discipline (or several disciplines) even in the context of a multidisciplinary complex. As a result, the discipline may change to incorporate such objects, but this is rarely a simple or straight-forward process, and one interesting question is whether the digital calls for other modes of investigation, collaboration and making that may be partially incompatible with the epistemic commitments of the established discipline or field:
                    
                    <blockquote><p>It follows that the consequences and implications of digital media for research into cultural studies themes, problematic, and questions cannot be explored simply by using the recognized, legitimate, preconstituted, disciplinary forms of knowledge: literary studies, philosophy, sociology, history, psychoanalysis, and so on. Digital media change the very nature of such disciplines, rending them “unrecognizable” as Derrida says of psychoanalysis. [<a class="ref" href="#hall2008">Hall 2008</a>, 81]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">On a more mundane scale, there is definitely a tension between the traditional disciplines and some of the scholars and initiatives engaged with the digital as a study object. This sentiment, which may lead to the establishment of discipline-external centers or even new disciplines, is also significant. So while technology as a study object will often foster a much tighter relationship to the disciplines (closer to the heart of the disciplines) than technology as a tool, there might also be distancing. However, this distancing is often not institutionalized, which is an important factor in maintaining a fairly strong link to the disciplines. Humanities computing, on the other hand, is almost always institutionalized to some extent. For initiatives focused on the digital as a study object, discipline-external sentiment can be seen as channeled through organizations such as the Association of Internet Researchers, which gathers researchers from a number of disciplines.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">In some cases, however, new fields or areas of research are institutionalized in relation to specific themes or study objects. An example would be games studies and internet studies, which have partly been institutionalized in some university contexts (e.g. at the Center for Games Research at the IT University in Copenhagen, the Singapore Internet Research Centre at Nanyang Technological University and the Oxford Internet Institute). Typically these do not strongly align themselves  discursively with the digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">Part of the problem with an inclusive and broad notion of digital humanities may be that the relatively high level of abstraction makes it difficult to come to grips with the field on a more basic and practical level. From a strategic level, however, this may not be a problem, but rather an asset as it makes it possible to frame a large scope, substantial impact and broad engagement. This engagement often relates to the development of the humanities at large, a discussion of the traditional humanities disciplines, and sometimes a call to action. The below quote is from a HASTAC Forum discussion on the digital humanities where Brett Bobley, head of the NEH (National Endowment of the Humanities) Office of Digital Humanities, was one of the interlocutors.
                    
                    <blockquote><p>I don't know how Brett Bobley or others might answer this but I don't actually find disciplines tragic . . . just in need of major refurbishing and a good dose of introspection about what it is they do, how willing they are to be irrelevant to a larger world, how they fight their declining (in the humanities) numbers, and how urgently they reconsider their shape and importance in the light of the new, global forms of knowledge being produced everywhere around them, and changing the timelines and the geography of knowledge production. It is such an exciting time and I wish more in the humanities grasped the implications of what this new time means for the shape of our many fields and inter-fields. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#davidson2009">#davidson2009</a></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">There is a fair degree of sympathy and understanding for the traditional (but
                    seemingly declining) humanities in this statement, as well as a call for change.
                    The digital humanities, thus, becomes a site for change and action.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Two Types of Digital Humanities</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">The diverse and multiple-mode territory of the digital humanities can be further exemplified by two descriptions of digital humanities in an educational context. The first text is a description of a planned, but not realized, interdisciplinary major in the Digital Humanities at Stanford University:
                    
                  <blockquote><p>The increasing importance assumed by digital technologies in contemporary culture has given rise to new forms of scholarly inquiry, new ways to assess and to organize humanistic knowledge, and new forms of cultural communication. The very questions that the humanities disciplines ask have changed. How have reading and writing changed in the digital era? What new forms of cultural expression emerge with the advent of the digital age and how do they build upon or break with the old? How should we assess the ethical and political implications of digital technologies?  What kinds of tools do we have or do we need to develop in order to make sense of and/or to take advantage of these new technologies? [<a class="ref" href="#ish2008">Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Here the emergent nature of digital humanities is emphasized, as well as a strong link to the humanities disciplines and a partial reconfiguration of the humanities. The major mode of engagement is technology as a study object, even if there is also an interest in the instrumental use of digital technology, and to some extent, information technology as a medium. In contrast, the following description from the Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH) website at King’s College provides a much more static description of digital humanities. The main mode of engagement is clearly technology as a tool.
                    
                    <blockquote><p>The digital humanities comprise the study of what happens at the intersection of computing tools with cultural artefacts of all kinds. This study begins where basic familiarity with standard software ends. It probes how these common tools may be used to make new knowledge from our cultural inheritance and from the contemporary world. It equips students to analyze problems in terms of digital methods, choose those best for the job at hand, apply them creatively and assess the results. It teaches students to use computing as an instrument to investigate how we know what we know, hence to strengthen and extend our knowledge of the world past and present. [<a class="ref" href="#cch2006">Centre for Computing in the Humanities</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">We need to be careful not to draw too far-reaching conclusions from such limited and contextually situated material, but there can be no doubt that these two descriptions suggest rather different types of digital humanities and epistemic cultures. Unsurprisingly, there are several points of connection. One such connection is offered by the mention of tools and creating tools at the end of the first text, which relates to the predominant focus on tools and methods in the second text. Interestingly, despite the general CCH focus on tools, the short text does not say anything about creating new tools.

                    general definition and the particular activities listed. A similar narrowing
                    down of epistemic scope (in that case from a broad sense of digital humanities

The idea of the library as a space for collaborative scholarship is strengthened through the introduction of more study spaces for (primarily) students, project spaces for digital humanities and technical infrastructure such as large, interactive screens.  Perhaps libraries have always been the analogue to laboratories, in that they are sites for knowledge production, a repository or archive, and a place of exchange.

To the challenge of understanding the implications of technological innovations, Critical Digital Studies responds by developing a new method of critical digital studies: its scope — full-spectrum knowledge of the digital future; its method — media archaeology; its practice — crossing boundaries; and its goal — bending the digital future in the direction of creative uncertainty. [<a class="ref" href="#kroker2008">Kroker &amp; Kroker 2008</a>, 1]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">Here we are concerned with a rather future driven, positivistic and arguably

The answer has to do with how we relate to divisions between the humanities and art, the humanities and science, thinking and making, and the university and the outside world. These categories are not binary, and it does seem that the digital can sometimes help challenge these oppositions. Also, it would seem that the contemporariness of much of interpretative digital humanities work, coupled with an interdisciplinary sentiment and digital means of production and intervention, support an interest in academic activism.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">We will return to a more in-depth discussion of the various modes of engagement

But let us first consider the inhabitants and landscape of the digital humanities.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Digital Humanists and Digital Humanities</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">As we have seen, digital humanities hardly make up an uncontested or well-defined
                    landscape. So far the picture has been painted using rather broad and structural
                    brush strokes. Another way of approaching this issue is to start from the individual or particular — from the individual person engaged in what may be called digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">It would seem tenable to state that minimally, digital humanities is manifested
                    by a single scholar, teacher, artist, programmer, engineer or student doing some
                    kind of work — thinking, reflecting, writing, creating — at the intersection of
                    the humanities and information technology — or by "products" resulting from such activities. Every combination of the humanities and technology does not qualify as digital humanities, of course. For instance, while word processors may be interesting as a study object from a humanities perspective — e.g. looking at their conceptual history, the textually of revision functionality, or the prescriptiveness of built-in dictionaries — a humanities scholar using a word processor to write an article would not necessarily qualify as a digital humanist.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">As a matter of fact, it is not entirely clear that even individuals deeply engrossed in the digital humanities would necessarily identify with the denominations "digital humanist" or "digital humanities." Partly because of the diversity and history of the field, disassociation may be rather vigorous:
                    
                    <blockquote><p>How different is it [speculative computing] from digital humanities? As different as night from day, text from work, and the force of controlling reason from pleasures of delightenment. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#drucker2009a">#drucker2009a</a></span></p></blockquote>
                    Here the reading of digital humanities as traditional humanities computing seems rather clear, and the positioning of speculative computing outside the digital humanities would seem to contradict a very inclusive notion of the digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">The individual term <em class="term">digital humanist</em> may be problematic because it
                    may seem both too general in not relating to a specific discipline or competence
                    (thus deemphasizing the discipline-specific or professional) and too specific in
                    emphasizing the "digital" part of the scholarly identity (if you are scholar) or giving too much prominence to the humanities part of your professional identity (if you are a digital humanities programmer or a system architect). The more general and non-personal term <em class="term">digital humanities</em> is more inclusive, but somewhat limited because of its lack of specificity and relatively weak disciplinary anchorage. For both variants, there is also a question of whether "the digital" needs to be specified at all, and it is not uncommon<a class="noteRef" href="#d3669e501">[9]</a> to encounter the argument that technology and the digital are part or will be part of any academic area, and hence the denotation "digital" is not required.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">But clearly these terms are gaining ground, and while the introduction of the term

                    strategy-driven process starting with journal names, funding initiatives and conferences, it now seems as if also <em class="term">digital humanist</em> is spreading quickly as a means of self-identification. This is especially true of the plural form in addressing digital humanists collectively as in "Calling all Digital Humanists in the Pacific Northwest: Organizing THATCamp PNW"[<a class="ref" href="#meloni2009">Meloni 2009</a>]. A more recent development is that scholars to a larger extent describe themselves as digital humanists on their personal websites and in other contexts, although there may be a certain degree of hesitancy:
                    
                    <blockquote><p>Recently I’ve claimed "digital humanist," though that

                    <em class="term">digital humanists</em> are more commonly used in relation to the digital as tool (and the humanities computing tradition) than the digital as study object, but the landscape is shifting. We also need to bear in mind that institutional identity is often linked to particular disciplines and departments rather than to the humanities more broadly (which is a much more abstract construction). It could be speculated that comparatively speaking, people in the digital humanities may seem to have a stronger sense of the humanities as a construct and as a whole since they often operate across several disciplines and since their position and identity are more strongly linked to the humanities at large. As for <em class="term">digital humanities</em>, several organizations and consortia (with different agendas) are pushing for the term. A move of considerable symbolic power is the 2008 establishment of the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities in the U.S.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p54">These changing patterns can be exemplified by means of some crude search data
                    from Google and the development between two data points approximately one and a
                    half years apart. Needless to say, these data should be treated with caution in
                    terms of methodology and accuracy, and the absolute figures have little
                    significance. What is interesting is the indication given by the relative change
                    in frequency. On March 10, 2008, the query "digital humanist" resulted in
                    420 hits on Google. There were about the same number of hits for the plural form
                    "digital humanists" (456 hits), and there were (about) 99,800 instances of
                    "digital humanities." The same queries executed on October 6, 2009, show
                    that "digital humanist" is about eight times more common (3460), "digital
                    humanists" 40 times more common (18,600), while the number of instances
                    of "digital humanities" has doubled (about 180,000). The general pattern
                    seems to be that direct references to digital humanists (singular and plural)
                    have become much more common relative to references to digital humanities. The
                    more frequent use of the plural form (five times as frequent as the singular
                    form) is not surprising given that it carries with it a lesser degree of
                    individuation (focusing on the group of digital humanists rather than individual
                    people, cf. [<a class="ref" href="#svensson1998">Svensson 1998</a>]) and seems to point to digital humanists being more commonly identified as a group of individuals. The more moderate relative increase of "digital humanities" would seem to indicate a degree of saturation or possibly moving away from the over-arching term to more specific reference ("digital humanist" and "digital humanists").</div></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Part II: Encounters</h1><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Introduction</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55">Another perspective on the landscape of digital humanities can be offered by

                    the examination of associated spaces, which is based on the assumption that

They are also chosen because they accentuate different modes of engagement and perspectives on the digital humanities.

                    <blockquote><p>It's hard to separate the ACTLab philosophy from the studio space, and vice versa.  They are co-emergent languages.

                    or at least manageable interdisciplinary strategy. Broad themes allow faculty
                    and students from a range of departments to participate around a topic of
                    interest. In Sandy Stone’s words, "Our curricular philosophy
                        is about constructing dynamic topic frameworks which function by defining
                        possible spaces of discourse rather than by filling topic areas with
                        facts" [<a class="ref" href="#stone2005">Stone 2005</a>]. ACTLab courses at this time included
                    "Postmodern Gothic" (1996), "Gender and Sexuality at the Millennium: The Future of Desire" (1998), "Reading Reality: Virtual and Physical Narratives" (2000). There was a clear emphasis on creating and the below description seem to indicate that making precedes theory, or that making is primary or initial.
                    
                    <blockquote><p>ACTLab courses are concept-driven, rather than skills-driven; but we believe
                    that theory flows from the act of making, rather than the other way around. The
                    point of each ACTLab course is to help you define, develop, and produce a
                    project that reflects on the social, cultural, aesthetic, political, and
                    personal issues raised in that particular class. […]  Our motto is <em class="emph">make stuff</em>.

                    sure you're taking advantage of technology, rather than waking up to find that
                    technology is taking advantage of you. That's why we encourage critical thinking, and offer you the opportunity to engage cutting-edge theory along with making.

Obviously, these are not distinct categories, and there is a fair deal of blurriness and a dynamic balance. In the case of ACTLab it seems that making is privileged and that critical practice, to a large extent, is achieved through the making.  Consequently, there is considerably less focus on more traditional forms of critical production and reflection. This affects the balance and outset, and it seems that an enterprise such as ACTLab has more in common with an art school or a media production studio than a humanities department.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">ACTLab began 1992 in a "closet" (Sandy Stone’s description).

The space was quite distinct in combining studio, performance and seminar elements as well as incorporating various technologies (both analogue and digital), and importantly, ACTLab could not be described as a sterile or instrumental space. The spatial grounding of ACTLab is obviously important, and in the personal experience of the author, there is a recurring interest in having lab and studio space when talking to the digital humanities community.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">As evident from both the physical setup of the ACTLab studio and the above
                    quote, technology is an integral part of the setup — and although making does
                    not necessarily have to be digital or digitally supported, technology is
                    undoubtedly an important prerequisite in this space for "making stuff."
                  This closeness to technology, "tinkering" and digitally supported expression is not necessarily that common in the digital humanities. In terms of the modes of engagement discussed in this article, the focus on technology as "tools rather as ends in themselves" suggests an instrumental relation, which here is intimately linked to the digital as a means of expression and as an activist venue in various projects and installations. Also, through the themes employed in the courses there is — to varying degrees — an interest in the digital as a study object. Nevertheless, it is quite likely that the ACTLab community would never use "digital humanities" to describe themselves (the online correlation seems almost negative).<a class="noteRef" href="#d3669e654">[12]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p64">Although the ACTLab relates to many different disciplines and institutions, there
                    seems to be a clear sense of being outside the traditional structures. Sandy Stone talks about the codeswitching umbrella — a device used to hide what is beneath and vice versa — and the contrast between the inside and outside is fundamental in the model presented. Institutional dire necessities, discourses of closure, structure and bean counting are contrasted with messy creativity, emergent work, risk, passion and deliberate structurelessness. According to Stone, "When people below the umbrella experience passion, people above the umbrella see structure." The sense of being outside and oppositional is recurring in the narratives surrounding the ACTLab:
                    
                    <blockquote><p>Like any oppositional practice, we don't just live under the
                        codeswitching umbrella; we also live under the institutional radar, and to
                        live under the radar you have to be small and lithe and quick.  We cut our
                        teeth on nomadics, and although we've had some hair-raising encounters with
                        people who went to great lengths to stabilize the ACTLab identity, we're still nomadic and still about oppositional practices. [<a class="ref" href="#stone2005">Stone 2005</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">This oppositional stance creates a strong discursive delineation between the ACTLab and the rest of the university, and although Stone talks about operating under the radar it also seems that ACTLab clearly and consistently signals its status of being different and oppositional; this is part of the essence of the ACTLab. There are several possible consequences of such a strategy; for instance a strong sense of interior community and a focus on collaboration with particular individuals rather than on structural and institutional collaboration. More importantly, it would seem that an inside position — under the umbrella — is not easily compatible with changing or subverting what is outside (e.g. the rest of the university) — above the umbrella. This is a deliberate and justifiable strategy, of course, but nevertheless an important question is whether there could be mutual gains from a more permeable umbrella?</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Encounter 2</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66"><blockquote><p><span class="hi italic">It just so happens that on Sept. 29-30, SHL will be hosting an important meeting on digital humanities work which will include two sessions that might be of interest to you: one (in the late afternoon of Sept. 29) a public conversation involving the directors of SHL, the Duke Franklin center, UCHRI, and the like; the second, on the morning of Sept. 30, a closed door conversation between the leaders of several new SHL-type research centers and top industry, foundation, and museum people about potential partnerships.

HASTAC had recently been co-founded by David Theo Goldberg, UC Humanities Research Institute, and Cathy Davidson, Duke University (in 2002).

Normally one screen serves as the primary screen and the two others function as supplementary screens. I have seen all of the screens used at the same time, but it is much more common that only the main screen is used. While there was a distinct physical grounding for the meeting, the multi-institutional sentiment and organization of HASTAC was rather based on the idea of a virtual organization.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p69">69</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p69">At the HASTAC meeting I met a range of people interested in the digital humanities from a number of mostly American universities and institutes. American-style humanities centers were well represented. There was a multi-level discussion with a slant towards the institutional, organizational and visionary.  Cathy Davidson and David Theo Goldberg spoke of HASTAC as a project. Both Davidson and Goldberg combine excellent track records in more traditional humanities and social science research with high-level institutional positions, which adds credibility and probably also leads to the foregrounding of questions to do with institutional practice, university-level strategies, national and international perspectives, and funding.

                    they work closely with humanities departments, they also typically maintain
                    distance and a high degree of independence (see also [<a class="ref" href="#shanks2008">Shanks 2008</a>] for a related vision of humanities hubs).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p72">72</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p72">At the Stanford-based event, a pronounced interest in collaborative practice,

                    McPherson described the vision behind <cite class="title italic">Vectors</cite>,
                    which is a truly innovative attempt at moving technology as medium far beyond
                    traditional scholarly manifestations while maintaining scholarly rigor and
                    engagement. Some of the topics of the journal relate to the digital as a study
                    object, but most do not. Some pieces might be described as installations while
                    others are more akin to traditional humanities computing tools, or standard, if
                    multi-modal, articles. Normally there is some element of interaction. The main
                    mode of engagement is arguably technology as an expressive medium, however, and it could probably be argued that the journal rarely includes prototypical tools in line with the humanities computing tradition.

                    phase — focusing on strategic-level issues at the expense of the more mundane
                    issues such as actual research and real implementation. Put differently, there
                    may be a gap between strategy, politics and grand visions and the grounding
                    found in individual and institutional practice. This gap may be enlarged by the
                    distributedness of such virtual organizations, although importantly, this
                    organizational form is also scalable and potentially quite powerful. And because
                    of the high-level, structural interest, the scope of transformation advocated
                    may extend far beyond the intersection of the Humanities and information technology proper.  While very important and exciting, this large scope and far-reaching ambitions may create a dissonance with ground-level research and education. It might be argued, however, that initiatives such as HASTAC are in fact establishing academic "trading zones" [<a class="ref" href="#galison1997">Galison 1997</a>] for the digital humanities, and that dissonance is integral to that process.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p75">75</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p75">Furthermore, there is an important and complex relationship among pushing for changing funding, university and reward systems, and close contact with various policy makers and industry. There may be a risk of relying too much on external structures and hence directly or indirectly buying into belief systems that are part of such structures.

                    term (relating it to humanities computing) in one of the labs of the humanities
                    computing program at the University of Alberta in Canada. In a well-equipped lab
                    mainly set up for computer workstation work, there was also a large table affording laptop work and meetings. I enjoyed the mixed environment as well as getting a sense of what the students were working on.

Based on my admittedly limited experience, it seems that Canadian humanities computing is characterized both by a commitment to humanities computing as practice and paradigm (hence maybe also less use of the term <em class="term">digital humanities</em>) and an openness and willingness to engage with humanities and other disciplines broadly. This leads to a balancing act that often can consume much time and energy, and requires administrative maneuverability. The commitment to working with the disciplines in the case of the Humanities Computing Programme at Alberta (which much humanities computing activities at Alberta is centered around) is basic but not trivial:
                    
                    <blockquote><p>The balance between pursuing in-depth studies in the intellectual rigours of one discipline versus a broader integration of theoretical approaches is a constant struggle. The programme committee, with consultation from departmental representatives, decided that exposure to a breadth of disciplines should be essential to the MA as a Faculty of Arts programme, but that depth of knowledge in one discipline should be a complementary priority. Students apply to do the MA in Humanities Computing through a ‘home’ department: that is, one of the existing departments in the Humanities, Social Sciences or Fine Arts. [<a class="ref" href="#sinclair2002">Sinclair &amp; Gouglas 2002</a>, 174]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p79">79</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p79">During my visit we had several discussions of institutional models and it was
                    entirely clear that this kind of integration was seen as crucial. Over time,
                    administrative and implementation pathways are established, although trying to
                    establish a multi-department model can be quite challenging. You need to involve a number of departments and you are dependent upon them and their support, and while affiliating students with humanities departments may not be difficult, a far greater challenge may be with departments outside of the humanities proper (not because of these departments, but because of administrative and disciplinary boundaries). Likewise, finding sustainable ways of sharing resources (including faculty) between departments and a humanities computing center or programme can be difficult, especially if the departments are small or pressed financially.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p80">80</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p80">We also talked about space in relation to the lab I visited, as well as more
                    generally. It was obvious that the fairly large meeting table, prominently
                    placed in the lab as you enter the room, had not been easy to come by. In a
                    <cite class="title italic">Humanist</cite> entry from 2002, Stéfan Sinclair reports
                    usefully about the first year’s experiences from running the M.A. program in
                    humanities computing at Alberta. One of the challenges he refers to is "offering social space to accompany the excellent lab space that we have — Humanities Computing should certainly be aware of the importance of human interaction in the work we do" [<a class="ref" href="#sinclair2002a">Sinclair 2002</a>]. The social affordances of the space I visited had been come by through taking tables assigned for computers and putting them together into a large meeting table. The administration would not easily approve of a "non-functional" table. This is a tendency I have come across in labs and university environments around the world — the difficulty of controlling and planning the spaces that often are at the heart of educational and research programs.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p81">81</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p81">It was apparent from the students talking about their projects that humanities
                  computing at Alberta supports multiple modes of engagement with technology. While technology as tool (as in traditional humanities computing) predominates, some projects were much closer to technology as study object. In general, the intellectual milieu seemed to draw on this multiplexity as well as on creating (often through programming) as an important part of the research process. Part of the discussion concerned Ph.D. possibilities and it was abundantly clear that few schools offer the kinds of programs that meet student expectations.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3669e784">[13]</a> The question is whether such a program should maintain the balance demonstrated in a program such as the M.A. in Humanities Computing, or whether it would provide greater emphasis on either technology or an individual discipline. The transfer between different academic levels and schools can often prove to be a challenge as you build up new curricula and interdisciplinary programs. The temptation can also be to abandon a strong multiple affiliation model for more unified, and eventually disciplinary program.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p82">82</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p82">I talked to Geoffrey Rockwell about process and methodology in relation to tool building and textual analysis. He is a well-established researcher and organizer in humanities computing who has long experience from large-scale projects such as Tapor, and he has progressively advocated web-based, modular and relatively open-ended tools for a long time (as opposed to the all-in-one software packages that were common earlier in humanities computing), as well as engaged with social software. When I was there, Rockwell and Stéfan Sinclair had just finished a bout of what they call experiments in text analysis or extreme text analysis.
                    
                  <blockquote><p>The idea is simple. Two people do text analysis together with only one person on the computer and the other directing and commenting (and typing a meta-narrative on another computer). This means that all decisions have to be discussed and negotiated which means that one is forced to reflect on what one is doing, which was the point for us. It takes longer, but you get a better result and you are forced to reflect on what you are doing […] Extreme Text Analysis, as we practiced it, was more a reflective practice, that used experiments in small text analysis to reflect on methodology and technology. [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2008">Rockwell 2008</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p83">83</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p83">In their practice, they produce short web essays that do not focus on methodology or text analysis, but on the research question posed. It could probably be argued, however, that there is a basic tool-based sentiment here, which is maybe emphasized by the brevity of the individual analyses. Through using modular tools from the Tapor project, they are able to embed dynamic content in the web essays and, for instance, allowing a reader to check a query or try another one. In the example I was shown, the corpus query used in the article could be rerun, but interestingly and innovatively, you could also run a different query. This type of dynamic tool could be quite useful for not least text-centric academic publication. The researchers document the process through a meta level document and they provide reflections on text analysis. All this is done over a very limited period of time. While Rockwell’s and Sinclair’s extreme text analysis experiments are limited so far, there is no doubt that this is methodologically and conceptually a very interesting approach to text analysis drawing on a new generation of modular web tools, making and experimenting as an important part of the process, and combining interpretative and methodological foci.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Encounter 4</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p84">84</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p84">I had been intrigued by internet studies

One important, distinguishing parameter is how different perspectives and initiatives relate to information technology and the digital. For example, as we have seen, traditional humanities computing tends to have a rather instrumental relationship to information technology, which serves primarily as a tool, whereas a cultural or media studies-based approach is more likely to focus on digital culture and the cultural construction of information technology as a study object.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p102">102</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p102">In the previous analysis, it has been suggested that the territory of the

                        modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology or the digital. Below, I will examine five major modes of engagement in some more detail: information technology as a tool, as a study object, as an expressive medium, as an experimental laboratory and as an activist venue. The first three modes will receive the most attention. Importantly, these should not be seen as mutually exclusive or overly distinct but rather as co-existing and co-dependent layers, and indeed, the boundaries in-between increasingly seem blurry. This does not mean, however, that it may not fruitful to analyze and discuss them individually as part of charting the digital humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p103">103</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p103">Different disciplines are likely to privilege different modes of engagement. For instance, cultural anthropology would seem more concerned with technology and the digital as an object of analysis than as a tool, and the converse relationship would probably be true of large parts of history as a discipline. Similarly, different approaches and interdisciplinary research fields express different configurations of engagement with the digital. Some of these will be explored below.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Tool</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p104">104</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p104">The instrumental role of information technology seems rather self-evident. Computers and, more generally, information technology are very capable of handling an increasing set of tasks.  Historically, computers have often been seen only as tools, although that perception has changed over time<a class="noteRef" href="#d3669e915">[14]</a>:
                        
                        <blockquote><p>In its fifty-year history, the computer so far has been a calculating machine, an electronic brain, a filing cabinet, a clerk, and a secretary. […] In the 1940s, when the brilliant and elegant John von Neumann, the brilliant and eccentric Alan Turing, and many others were designing the first programmable computers, they were not defining a new medium. They were building super-fast calculating engines to solve problems in science and engineering. <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#bolter2003">#bolter2003</a></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p105">105</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p105">Computers in humanities computing often take on the role of "calculating

                        of computers as a tool may be an ideology of cognition and functionalism
                        (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#golumbia2009">Golumbia 2009</a>]). As has been noted, the instrumental relationship to information technology is nearly a defining property for traditional humanities computing. The website for the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) states that "[o]ur goal is to explore and develop information technology as a tool for scholarly humanities research" [<a class="ref" href="#iath">IATH</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d3669e939">[15]</a> This focus on tools naturally entails that the tools envisioned are different from standard tools such as word processing and web browsers. The challenge, as identified by Andrea Laue and others, also involves producing a new set of tools that are not as machine-like:
                        
                        <blockquote><p>In practice, the symbiotic machine became a problem-solving rather than a problem-posing device. For the most part, that is how the computer continues to function. Licklider’s dream remains largely unfulfilled. Perhaps transforming the computer from machine to tool, from a device that automates mundane mental tasks to one that augments critical and creative thought, is the task now facing computing humanists. [<a class="ref" href="#laue2004">Laue 2004</a>, 159]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p106">106</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p106">Interestingly, Laue’s argument is clearly placed within the framework of

                        for instance cybercultural, internet and media studies and internet studies, the instrumental use of information technology does often not extend far beyond standard tools.

                        to try out available tools than previously — for instance, through employing
                        web-based software such as visualization tools or various APIs<a class="noteRef" href="#d3669e951">[16]</a> to online
                        services such as map services, social platforms and data base systems. Data
                        can also be systematically collected from online environments, games (e.g.
                        game metrics), as well as through tools and methodologies such as
                        eye-tracking equipment (e.g. for analysis of game play or online newspaper
                        reading) and multi-spectral analysis (e.g. reconstruction of the making of
                        art pieces such as paintings). Environmental archaeology data can be used for large scale aggregated modeling and visualizations of pre-historical environments, and data and material about historical sites can be used to create virtual reconstructions.

It is fairly obvious that we are concerned with a range of tools and tool uses. Some are more specific to the digital humanities than others. For instance, while word processors certainly play a very important role for digital humanities, they are not specific to digital humanities. A concordance program, however, is much more specific and used by a smaller group of people. Many of these users would be "digital humanists" in disciplines such as linguistics and literary studies. This tool has an analogue predecessor and a largely "automatic" function. Consequently, it could be argued that a traditional piece of concordance software exhibits a high level of automaticity and fairly low degree of innovativeness. We may also want to refer to the interpretative, representational and explorative powers of tools:
                        
                        <blockquote><p>To date, the digital technology used by humanities scholars has focused almost exclusively on methods of sorting, accessing, and disseminating large bodies of materials. In this respect the work has not engaged the central questions and concerns of the disciplines. It is largely seen as technical and pre-critical, the occupation of librarians, and archivists, and editors. The general field of humanities education and scholarship will not take up the use of digital technology in any significant way until one can clearly demonstrate that these tools have important contributions to make to the exploration and explanation of aesthetic works. [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann2002">McGann 2002</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p115">115</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p115">There is a difference between a tool that mainly allows you to search for linguistic constructions in a text database (showing results in a table or concordance list), and a tool that does that as well as provides an interface where you can visualize results, create interpretative models, collaborate with others and combine different medial representations (for instance sound-audio, text, a timeline and relevant metadata).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p116">116</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p116">Further suggestions for what to look for in analyzing and designing tools are

                    distribution. Through interaction design research, a number of digital artifact
                    qualities can be brought into the picture. For instance, [<a class="ref" href="#lovgren2004">Lövgren &amp; Stolterman 2004</a>] bring up categories such as motivation (e.g. playability and seductivity), immediate experience (e.g. pliability and fluency), social level (e.g. social action space and identity), structural qualities or engineering ideals (e.g. elegance and efficiency) and user creation of meaning (e.g. ambiguity and surprise).

In this sense, study objects include phenomena, cultural artifacts and processes that to some extent are digitally inflected. There is a fairly large group of researchers whom engage in "internet studies," of which many are organized by the Association of Internet Researchers (cf. the encounter described in Part II above). They had their tenth conference in October 2009. The organization is presented on their website as follows:
                        
                      <blockquote><p>The Association of Internet Researchers is an academic association dedicated to the advancement of the cross-disciplinary field of Internet studies.

                        appears on the main "about" page on the organization’s website.
                        Moreover, it is interesting to see that the research promoted is described
                        as "independent from trauditional disciplines." While we should not read too much into this, it is somewhat telling that the perspective presented is one of alleged independence rather than one pointing to the interaction between the organization and associated research in the traditional disciplines (where most of the participants are probably located institutionally).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p123">123</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p123">Returning to the question of modes of engagement, it seems quite clear that
                        the principal mode for internet research of this type is the digital or the
                        internet as an object of analysis. This is not very surprising, of course, but it makes internet studies an interesting area to look more carefully in this context — also because it is a large and important organization. The investment in this particular mode of engagement seems quite clear. As the above quote shows, the internet is not necessarily seen as a study object that can be handled within the realms of any existing or new discipline, or even from an interdisciplinary, but not transdisciplinary, perspective.
                        
                        <blockquote><p>A trandisciplinary field is one defined by the globality of its object of study, combined with the complex, emergent, and changing nature of that object (Genosko, 2002, p. 26). The very nature
                        of the Internet as an object of study is its incomprehensibility as a whole from disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspectives. [<a class="ref" href="#hunsinger2005">Hunsinger 2005</a>, 277]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p124">124</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p124">The study object is thus seen to be too complex or dynamic to be managed by any one discipline, and it can be argued that an approach less based on traditional institutional structure has clear advantages. 
                        
                        <blockquote><p>In the indisciplined approach, there is no importance attached to unity of perspective or method because there is no need to engage in exclusionary boundary work.

Looking at the internet research community on a more general level, there seems to be a sense that the perceived independence is quite important.

Importantly, the digital may not have to be the main focus itself, but rather phenomena, cultural artifacts and processes that are digitally inflected.

                        different types of content and media. Some of this content is born-analogue
                        and much of it is born-digital. Increasingly, but not necessarily, these
                        expressions are media rich, polytextual and mixed. [<a class="ref" href="#schnapp2009">Schnapp &amp; Shanks 2009</a>, 147] discuss "fungibility" — the gathering

As <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2009a">#mcpherson2009a</a></span> points out, some disciplines in the humanities have been affected significantly by this change including visual, media and digital studies. This engagement has typically been on the level of object of study rather than the production of expressive, creative media:
                        
                        <blockquote><p>Nonetheless, we have been slow to explore the potential of interactive, immersive, and multimedia expression for our own thinking and scholarship, even as we dabble with such forms in our teaching. With a few exceptions, we remain content to comment about technology and media, rather than to participate more actively in constructing knowledge in and through our objects of study.  <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2009a">#mcpherson2009a</a></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p132">132</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p132">Looking at where we do find complex, multimodal, interactive and networked

This can presumably be traced back to the idea that students are seen as more adept at using new media and that they need this kind of literacy for future careers (in particular outside the academy). On the whole, undergraduate education is probably also more likely to change in relation to external expectations and availability of new expressive modes than research carried out by senior scholars as part of a highly structured reward system. This does not mean that the traditions of undergraduate humanities education are not challenged by these modes:

                        academically. Indeed, this pressure sometimes seems to result in securing

                        Monographs and, in some disciplines, peer-reviewed articles, are not just
                        tied to a traditional reward system, but may represent a dream of academic
                        expression and a distinct scholarly identity for many young researchers.
                        This sentiment may be difficult to disentangle from the fact that publishing
                        presses and venues are invested with respect and value.

If that Twitter feed, however, was suggested as carrying academic weight in a tenure portfolio, the stakes would be much higher.

                        provides an interesting example because of the use of networked (mainly text
                        based) communication channels, and how this communication and exposure
                        contributed to a conference that was not technology focused, as well as the
                        external "reading" of the conference. In particular, the digital
                        humanities contingency at the conference got received fairly large exposure
                        despite their comparatively small numbers. According to Amanda French's
                        calculation, a mere three percent of the conference participants were tweeters (in the sense of producing "Twitter entries" or tweets), and only few of these came from outside of "digital humanities." The relatively large exposure was partly because there were many digital humanities-like sessions, many of them reportedly well attended, but also because the digital footprint of this contingency was comparatively large. Twitter played an important role and the hash tag #MLA09 accumulated 1750 tweets between Dec 4, 2009, and January 4, 2010 (the majority during the actual conference, and the days before and after). Also, the story of one previous attendee, Brian Croxall, and his not coming to the conference for financial reasons made the connection between remote and present participation quite prevalent. In particular as this non-attendee posted his panel contribution online and tweeted about it at the same time as it was read at the conference [<a class="ref" href="#croxall2009">Croxall 2009</a>]. Other participants at the conference posted their contributions before they did their conference presentations, and in these cases there may be a Twitter flow before, during and after the actual presentation.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p138">138</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p138">Some of these uses of media are no more revolutionary than adding a YouTube

An even more recent example is provided by two partially simultaneous conferences in March 2010 with strong links to the digital humanities: the "NITLE Summit 2010: Advancing towards Liberal Arts 3.0" and the conference "Online Humanities Scholarship, The Shape of Things to Come".

Looking at academic publishing rather than conferences, a rich collaborative and networked process may be what leads to the publication of monograph (a privileged form of publication), but the monograph itself is likely to be seen as the product of one person or a few people.

                        get access to a new main text as soon as you have "read" the previous
                        one. Arguably text is the dominant carrier of meaning, although the piece is
                        also distinctly aural, visual and almost poetical. The textual expression
                        itself is not uniform. Not only does the text move, but it also is textured
                        through the use of different font sizes, colors and at times slanted text.
                        The layout and presentation of text is meaningful and an important part of
                        the narrative. There are also a number of images and a few films, all of
                        which contribute to a coherent and suggestive narrative. Another of the projects, "Killer Entertainments" (by Jennifer Terry, design by Reagan Kelly), uses three juxtaposed windows with video clips of combat from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as contextual, networked nodes that provide information and critical reflection.

A simple example would be a series of multimedia productions produced in Sweden about 10 years ago which covered the history of different parts of the capital (e.g. "Söderskivan" which covers the Southern part of Stockholm), by tracing history, large-scale demographic data and an extensive set of materials through an interactive and exploratory interface [<a class="ref" href="#stockholm1998">Stockholm City Archives 1998</a>]. This interface allowed easy navigation through large data sets, used multiple modes of visualization, gave quick responses and encouraged experimenting with the material. Although not interpretative in a strong sense, there is definitely a conceptual link to interpretative tools of the type discussed earlier, as exemplified by the tools the University of Virginia has produced. In this case, information technology does not only help manage, visualize and make accessible very rich materials, but it also facilitates exploratory and experimental interaction with the materials in a way that would not be possible without the technology.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p159">159</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p159">At a more concrete level, humanities laboratories or digital humanities centers can also be exploratory laboratories that support exploration and experimentation whether in physical, digital or hybrid spaces. The exploratory affordances in an environment such as HUMlab at Umeå University come from the availability of data sets, a mix of analytical and creative practices, interdisciplinary challenges and competencies, international visitors, easy access to different types of technologies (that do necessarily have a precise, predefined function), and from the sense of being in a collaborative, lab or studio like space. Digital platforms such as TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research) and Second Life can also function as exploratory spaces. When museology and culture analysis students at Umeå build exhibitions in Second Life and produce machinima films, the digital space is used as a laboratory that enables enactments and experimentation that would be quite difficult to facilitate in physical space. Similarly, when a researcher explores a text corpus through a collection of "interactive" tools provided in TAPoR, we may be concerned with a use of technology that extends beyond instrumental tools.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p160">160</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p160">If we consider the digital more generally as a possible laboratory for the

                        and exploratory tools and spaces. The Humanities is often portrayed as not
                        having a predicative or intervening role, whereas the sciences are said to
                        attempt to both explain and predict natural phenomena. In looking at the

They discuss experimental practices of disciplines such as physics, chemistry and biology, including controlled experiments and interceptive methods in limited and controlled environments. According to the authors, traditional humanities disciplines such as history, linguistics, comparative literature and art history make use of such practices to a very limited extent. Also, although the sciences study the "given" (nature) and the humanities study the "created" (what humans give rise to), the sciences are more prone to use active, interventionist methods and be involved in creative processes (e.g. creating new technology or materials). The humanities, which studies dynamic processes and cultural products associated with humankind, tend to observe, document and analyze, and are rarely seen as an important factor in creative processes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p162">162</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p162">Janlert and Jonsson argue that there are several reasons as to why the humanities tend to be analytical and passive in relation to their study objects: unmanageable objects of analysis (difficult to control and restrict), lack of scalability (often very substantial study objects that cannot be downscaled, and individual cultural artifacts that scale up badly because of the large number required), powerless models (limited quantitative models and lack of tools to manage large-scale qualitative analysis) and, finally, intervening and creating are often seen as controversial in the Humanities (ideologically difficult to implement active and intervening work processes).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p163">163</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p163">It seems clear that modern information technology can have a significant role
                        in facilitating the type of exploratory space — cultural laboratory — that Janlert and Jonsson discuss. The following is partly based on Janlert and Jonsson’s article. Dynamic visualization can offer a window to large data sets and possibilities to visualize or enact complex objects of analysis. Interactive tools can help the researcher to get an intuitive sense of objects of analysis and the model, and allow fast what-if analyses. On a more profound level, researcher interaction can change the models themselves, or their parameters, data and relations to allow the study of hypothetical correlations or comparison of outcomes from different models applied on the same object or situations. "Thick," qualitative models — of detailed environments, objects, processes and correlations, unstructured information — can be handled through use of technology, and complex qualitative correlations can be modeled by massive simulations. Digital, controlled spaces — such as virtual worlds — can be used to facilitate cultural laboratory work. Participants in simulations could be humans or computer run entities. Real time interactive data can feed into digitally enhanced research spaces. Of course, all this is fairly visionary and non-concrete, and maintaining a critical stance is quite important. There is no doubt, however, that we see many of the elements discussed here in some of the interpretative digital humanities tools, interfaces to large material, and some of the <cite class="title italic">Vectors</cite> projects.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Activist Venue</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p164">164</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p164">The issue of activism as related to the distinction between art, artistic

                        Secrets" as an example of an activism in an academic setting,
                        arguably placed within the digital humanities. There is a strong sense of
                        intervention here that resonates with the "active" humanities discussed
                        in the previous section. It could be argued that work such as Daniel’s
                        "Public Secrets" brings together artistic
                        installation and academic expression in a single frame that serves both as

In other initiatives and forums, the direct engagement is typically much stronger and there is a stronger focus on acting and intervening. An example of this would be a group such as Preemptive Media (which is related to what is often referred to as tactical media):

The critical overview of the landscape provided a structural and broad comprehension of the digital humanities as well as a critical discussion of typologies, varieties of digital humanities, epistemic traditions and digital humanists. In contrast, the four encounters focused on specific initiatives at particular points in time, and their material and ideational grounding.
