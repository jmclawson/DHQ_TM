                    anonymity as on the Internet where users create avatars in
                    forums and write without obvious material constraint;
                    however when considering documents such as graphic novels
                    and print fiction, the figure of the author remains a
                    nostalgic figure which grants validity to the document. In
                    classic comic book collections such as Watchmen and Batman:
                    Year One by Alan Moore and Frank Miller, the original
                    scripts by the authors are included in special editions in
                    both print and Kindle format. But these
                        "original" script pages are shrouded
                    in forms of anonymity as they illustrate signs of
                    digitization, either through scanning or during production
                    and thus display various visual clues, such as errors, which
                    relay levels of realness. Furthermore online versions of
                    these script pages, found on fan website databases and
                    authors’ blogs, are complicated by the anonymity the
                    Internet and digital editions produce. Therefore a digital
                    forensics methodology is used to interrogate these script
                    pages in both print and digital format to create an ordering
                    system for digitally manipulated text. It also endeavours to
                    illustrate the possibilities for a forming digital forensics
                    field by using various technical calculations and
                    recreations of text with original software and hardware.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Section 1: Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Online versions of text, whether accessed through Kindle
                    files, downloadable pdfs or blog postings, illustrate the
                    changing modality of humanities research that enables new
                    parameters for examination and discussion of non-traditional
                    material. Scholars have begun to study digitized classical
                    texts and images, such as scans of William Blake’s artwork
                    and Shakespeare’s folios; however, there exists a gap in
                    discourse: comic books/graphic novels. Though
                    Internet-moderated collections of digital comics have
                    existed for years, the availability of and discussions about
                    the value and production process of digital comics are
                    substantially more accessible with the recent growth of the
                    Internet [<a class="ref" href="#norcliffe2003">Norcliffe and Rendace 2003</a>]. Digitally produced
                    and circulated graphic novels and their accompanying
                    secondary texts present new challenges for analysis,
                    particularly regarding the formation of approaches to
                    digital media and its popularization in mainstream culture
                    and academia. Digital forensics is an approach that
                    investigates the ways in which digital data is stored and
                    transmitted on devices and traditionally utilized by "business, industry, government and
                            military" [<a class="ref" href="#palmer2002">Palmer 2002</a>], yet is also emerging within the arts as a productive
                    means of inquiry. Associated actions include retracing
                    keyboard strokes, recovering data and passwords through
                    decryption, and creating and comparing files in order to
                    understand how data and its encasing were constructed [<a class="ref" href="#palmer2002">Palmer 2002</a>]. Matthew Kirschenbaum (2008)
                    considers this in <cite class="title italic">Mechanisms: New Media
                        and the Forensic Imagination</cite>, stating that
                    digital forensics is "commemorative as
                        well as judicial, and fundamental to the arts as well as
                        the sciences "[<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>].
                    Employing the digital forensics methodology to the arts
                    requires a flexible subject; various versions of graphic
                    novels that have either been digitally reproduced or
                    formatted within a digital file provide an example of such
                        "crystallizing at the nexus of
                        storage, inscription and instrumentation". In
                    this study, [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>] uses the
                    example of floppy disks that contain video games, and the
                    magnetic engraving upon them, to practice a type of digital
                    forensics, allocating attention to the physical qualities of
                    the magnetic ribbon and retrieving electronic data from
                    discontinuities on the ribbon’s surface.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This article illustrates a modified digital forensics
                    methodology, utilizing both original print and digital
                    graphic novel texts as case studies to analyse digital/print
                    authorship and the associated Internet network through the
                    appendices, with primary focus on digitally reprinted
                    typewritten scripts by graphic novel authors Frank Miller
                        (<cite class="title italic">Batman Year One</cite>; <cite class="title italic">Daredevil</cite>) and Alan Moore (<cite class="title italic">Watchmen</cite>; <cite class="title italic">The
                        Killing Joke</cite>; <cite class="title italic">From
                        Hell</cite>), as well as unofficial digital versions
                    disseminated on the Internet. The digital forensics
                    methodology employed includes reproducing texts manually,
                    statistically calculating characteristics and using
                    scholarship from multiple fields to understand the ways in
                    which digital texts imitate original sources. While section
                    two contextualizes the connections between print and
                    capitalism, section three examines the probability of
                    scanning marks and page alignment in Miller’s <cite class="title italic">Batman: Year One</cite> by comparing
                    similar documents and calculating letters’ pixel ratios. The
                    fourth section offers a contrasting view of digital comic
                    scripts that derive from word processing programs and, as
                    such, requires different parameters such as encryption and
                    stylistic blocking for validation. Fake comic books scripts
                    are introduced in section five, examining their presence in
                    Moore’s <cite class="title italic">Watchmen</cite> where
                    conscious choices to include misalignment and typing errors
                    illustrate the ordering systems used by authors and
                    publishers to recreate authenticity. In this section, the
                    digital forensic method includes recreating the actual
                    script on a typewriter and calculating probability of
                    errors. Section six uses the methodology to interrogate blog
                    postings of Moore’s scripts and questions the blocking as
                    well as capitalization of words. It also considers the user
                    comments and whether the Internet breeds or credits
                    authenticity.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Conflicts surrounding legitimacy and anonymity of digitally
                    manipulated scripts propagate through these texts by levels
                    of realness presented to the reader by ordering systems,
                    such as errors. The term "realness"
                    represents the perceived value of authenticity by the user,
                    i.e. whether something is believable as existing in present
                    reality according to the reader. This evaluation of
                    competency and credibility is one of the requirements of a
                    digital forensics analysis [<a class="ref" href="#palmer2002">Palmer 2002</a>]. This
                    article attempts to articulate modern conceptions of digital
                    reading as well as digital writing through the interrogation
                    of the ordering system regulations that appear and their
                    associated credibility. The discourse network which is
                    produced and substantiated by these digitized graphic novels
                    involves complex connections between capitalism,
                    visualizations, technology, anonymity, authorship and
                    nostalgia; I believe that what an analysis of this network
                    or archive reveals is how the conditions surrounding a
                    digital text, not the text itself, produce our ability to
                    access and frame such a discourse network, as well as the
                    figure of the author in the digital era. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Section 2: Scripts and Selling Points</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Within the past few decades various comic book authors have
                    achieved celebrity status and characters have been
                    integrated into North American mythology, witnessed by the
                    popularity of movies such as <cite class="title italic">The Dark
                        Knight</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The
                        Avengers</cite> as well as events such as Comic Con.
                    Converted consumers who were not previously exposed to
                    comics as well as lifelong avid fans are expressing interest
                    in the creative process and the figure of the author,
                    driving multitudes of publishers to include original
                    scripts, drawings, and notes within digitally reproduced
                    reissues and collective volumes. These additional scripts
                    and notes constitute the paratext, e.g. that which surrounds
                    the main body of text; traditional examples of the paratext
                    include appendices, publishing marks, covers, and footnotes.
                    Within academics and publishing, Joseph Bensman (1988)
                    argues that "footnotes have important
                        institutional, 'political,' and aesthetic
                        functions"[<a class="ref" href="#bensman1988">Bensman 1988</a>]. Appendices and paratextual elements, specifically
                    typewritten comic book scripts, also occupy this space
                    within the graphic novel’s statements. The aesthetic and
                    institutional effect of the graphic novel’s paratext has
                    been used as a source of profit by companies who increase
                    the price of special reissued editions because of it.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The celebrity status of authors and inclusion of the new
                    paratext reflects the fetishization of these scripts and the
                    increasing aesthetics currency value. Typewriters are
                    similarly fetishized [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>], connoting
                    nostalgic images of previous eras and linking text with
                    monetary value. Nostalgia, which is the rubbing of past and
                    present [<a class="ref" href="#hutcheon1998">Hutcheon 1998</a>], lies in the discourse
                    network around the typewriter that recalls specific
                    political, cultural and domestic memories. Famous author’s
                    typewriters and the associated works have been sold for
                    higher market price as collector’s items as seen on websites
                    such as Etsy and Ebay. Further typewriter models and authors
                    are fetishized by the innumerable copies of images on

                    and never-before-seen original script pages, which the
                    jacket cover describes as providing "a

                    graphic novel is listed as one of the best sellers under the
                    fan favourites section heading (Fan Favourites DC). In
                    Gerard Genette’s (1997) definition of the paratext, it
                    serves to reveal or provide information for the reader, both
                    through immediate text such as jacket covers and through
                    text later formulated, such as a critical reading. The
                    graphic novels’ paratext sets not only the context for the
                    content in the foreword, but produces narratives that
                    function externally to the main text, a modern parallel to
                    hypertextuality seen in the afterword and typewritten
                    scripts. Furthermore these scripts convey the relationship
                    between romantic authority of the pre-contemporary
                    typewriter, essential in the modern creative process, and
                    Internet-associated anonymity. Although the realness of the
                    scripts is contestable, they highlight the fundamental
                    modality of acceptance that society employs toward printed

                    to display matching script and image; this highlights the
                    imposition of the digital on the technical reproduction. The
                    software and print machines designate the connection between
                    page and image as well as the sizing and quality of the two
                    visualizations as InDesign allows the user to set the pixel
                    density and colouring settings [<a class="ref" href="#adobe2014">Adobe 2014</a>].
                    The tension between the print and digital implicates
                    different levels of the discursive network due to the
                    temporal differences, e.g. the Xs occurred during typing,
                    whereas the scribbles were marked after the script had been
                    passed between collaborators and scanning occurred later.
                    The digital reproduction conflates these experiences or,
                    rather, does not leave obvious traces of multiple
                    collaborations. Furthermore, in comparing digital text to
                    1980s-reproduced texts, Frances Robertson (2013, p.117)
                    notes that "these typed-up looking pages
                        act to denote the sincerity and honest labour of the
                        writer."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Craig Dworkin (1999, p.62) comments on the use of symbols
                    such as dashes and ellipses, where the "symbols must be viewed; they cannot be spoken without
                        some contrived act of translation." Here the
                    scribbles, underlines, and X’d out letters similarly cannot
                    be spoken without the reader consciously integrating their
                    own proclivities into translations, and thus reiterations
                    for different readers are found in the prosody of the text.
                    The ephemeral quality of the script then is configured into
                    this construction and furthered as not every panel matches
                    the caption perfectly. These interventions associated with
                    InDesign contribute to anonymity of authorship and act as a
                    product of the collaborative nature of comic books, eroding
                    the notion of the singular author figure and contributing to
                    the multiplicity of the network that is emblematic of

                    conceal as much as they reveal. Typewritten overlays exert
                    authority of authorship while also succumbing to it. The
                    gesture of the typewriter is that it forces the writer to
                    think before typing in order to avoid errors [<a class="ref" href="#flusser2009">Flusser 2009</a>]. The Xs and ink scratches in
                    Figure 3 are effects of the gesture of typewriting, and thus
                    produce the ephemerality of these drafts presented to the
                    consumer. Conversely, word processors allow the user to edit
                    as they write, conflating the experience between writing and
                    editing, erasing the totality of the author. The
                    typewriter’s editing process is complicated by the fact that
                    these pages are digitally reproduced. The implication of the
                    text’s digital and physical qualities is exemplary of the
                    tensions between consumption and creation, illustrated by
                    the scanning/photocopying process. Evidence of scanning is
                    exhibited in the black borders on the top and bottom of the
                    four quadrants of script grids in Figure 1, which are
                    consistently parallel with the borders of the novel, yet the
                    borders of the actual scanned pages overlap at inconsistent
                    angles. Questioning the mistakes, such as border alignment
                    and errors, produces ambiguity surrounding the validity of
                    these digitally recreated documents and the author. If these
                    documents were key to the novel’s commercial success, normal
                    assumptions would be that DC Comics would have ensured these
                    documents were scanned properly or at least Photoshopped
                    straight. The misalignment is a reflection of how
                    typewritten documents assert authority and authorship in a
                    digital era; it becomes important that these pages are
                    misaligned to show the traces of the digital process in
                    order for the readers to ascribe these pages with a value of
                    realness and relinquish the anonymity of the collaborative

                    pixels, while for the secondary typeface is 7.83±.001: 1
                    pixels. Therefore by analysing the specific heights and
                    boldness, there is a definitive difference between the
                    script pages that results in part from digital manipulation.

                    which Microsoft Word highlights, but the reason why the
                    author did not fix these mistakes appears as two choices:
                    that the original script contained these errors, or that the
                    transcribing author made these errors. Errors enter the
                    discourse surrounding authorship, but unlike the scan marks
                    they blur as well as clarify the rules and signification
                    around the author figure. The ambiguity surrounding these
                    errors recalls the ambiguity within transmission of text
                    online as demonstrated by Alan Liu. [<a class="ref" href="#liu2004">Liu 2004</a>]
                    discusses the process by which the separation between the
                    first user (writer) and second user (reader) results in the
                    ambiguity of intentions. Although he refers to the structure
                    of a poem and the directions that need to be issued as to
                    how to reconstruct it after digital transmission (email),
                    his argument about the need for structure and rules is
                    applicable in the case of errors. In print, errors and marks
                    act as ordering structures which delegate specific sets of
                    texts to specific genres and formats to authors, but in the
                    digital culture they create an enigma of anonymity. The
                    properties of <cite class="title italic">The Killing Joke</cite>
                    document reinforce this type of anonymity and speculation
                    over truthfulness. Within the digital realm errors aren’t
                    enough to confirm authorship; it is encryption, the website
                    authority and the document ownership which provide a more
                    complete understanding of authorship. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Section 5: Photoshop and <cite class="title italic">Watchmen</cite></h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ <cite class="title italic">Watchmen</cite>, originally published in 1986,
                    presents the reader with several types of typewritten and
                    published text. The narrative of the story is told in three
                    modes: one being the journal of Rorschach, the text of a
                    pirate comic, and the third through a narrator presenting
                    excerpts from a superhero’s autobiography as well as
                    informational pamphlets and medical records. The
                    autobiography is of Hollis Mason, one of the original
                    superheroes within this fictional representation of America
                    in the 1980s, and has been reprinted for the reader with
                    conscious awareness of the circumstances. Although the
                    reprint is not in traditional typewriter Courier font,
                    indicating word processing, there are notes that have been
                    attached to the top of each page in typewritten script seen

                    the note reads: "presented here are the

                        Hollis Mason discusses... reprinted with permission of
                        the author "[<a class="ref" href="#moore2005">Moore 2005</a>, 23]. The note supports the
                    romantic notion of print authorship from the logic that in
                    order to reprint permission is needed of a singular person.
                    But overall authorship belongs to the creators of the
                    graphic novel, who in turn created both the note and the
                    autobiography. Therefore the digital confuses notions of
                    authorship as it allows creators the ability to overlay
                    notes and paperclips in realistic fashions with program such
                    as Photoshop. Although originally written in 1986 this new
                    version was recoloured and scanned in 2004, which allowed
                    for the modification of depth ratios present in the overlay
                    image.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">The uniformity of the note’s letters is similar to the
                    uniformity of false text at the end of Miller’s <cite class="title italic">Daredevil: Volume 1</cite> as the letters
                    in the notes have no inky bleeds, smudges or even scan
                    marks. The attempt to present this evidence as truthful to
                    the typewriter is noticeably exemplified in the slanted
                    alignment of the notes and the sections of text that are
                    interrupted by physical page boundaries. The projection of
                    authority and knowledge through the note is supported and
                    subverted simultaneously by the interruption of these
                    physical constraints. This fractious union is representative
                    of the implications that stem from recreating typewritten
                    text in a digital format as the typewritten text searches
                    for constant validation but is never justified in contextual
                    meanings. It is the form and physicality that produces its

                    authority and knowledge is witnessed in misspellings and
                    clerical errors, such as in the middle of the report with
                    the word "neretheless"[<a class="ref" href="#moore2005">Moore 2005</a>]. This mistake illuminates the
                    process of creating a realistic fake document. In
                    misspelling "neretheless," there are actually two
                    errors: the first error is the forgotten "v," the other
                    the reversal of the "r" and second "e." The
                        "v" is on the bottom row of the QWERTY assemblage,
                    common to typewriters and computers, therefore it is
                    unlikely that it would have been switched with the "r"
                    two rows above. This conclusion is supported by the
                    quantitative model purposed by Neil Kay’s (2013) equations
                    for the typewriter’s probability of conjoined letters. The
                    reversal of the "e" and "r" appears much more
                    common, as these two are frequently paired together and are
                    located beside each other on the QWERTY keyboard layout [<a class="ref" href="#kay2013">Kay 2013</a>]. This manipulation and romanticised
                    notion of the typewriter is supported by the existence of
                    other errors throughout this psychiatric evaluation, which
                    include three main types. The first is the reversal of
                    letters with examples "scine" (since), and "hte"
                    (the); improper spacing in "short ly" (shortly) and
                        "hima s" (him as); and addition/subtraction of
                    letters in "decide" (decided), "eduscation"
                    (education) and "forced ing" (forcing) [<a class="ref" href="#moore2005">Moore 2005</a>, 30–31]. Therefore it
                    indicates the salient precept that errors and misalignments
                    exist in order for a printed text to assert its validity as
                    belonging to reality. This dictates a template for errors;
                    specific mistakes or glitches signify a real text of
                    non-digital writing just as certain marks or disruptions
                    signify a scanned page.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">This idea is perpetuated in Alan Moore’s (2008) <cite class="title italic">The Killing Joke</cite> afterword, where
                    a short narrative tells the story of a man creating a
                    hypothetical killing of Batman. The status and authority of
                    the author, as well as the digital, are encoded within it.
                    The man videotapes his confessions and ideas and thus the
                    words are translated into the realm of the digital. By
                    portraying an author in a digital context, the idea is
                    subversive in its stance towards our understanding of the
                    figure of the author as cult status romantic image. It
                    conflates the time of writing and producing, erasing part of
                    the gesture of writing as the modern writer "is born simultaneously with his
                        text"[<a class="ref" href="#barthes1977">Barthes 1977</a>], just as digital word
                    processing conflates writing and editing. This erasure is
                    not in totality; it indicates a shift in the notions of the
                    author and the creative process which must now be considered
                    in the digital era. By using a digital forensics methodology
                    which examines the spelling errors and small page markings
                    as well as larger contextual instances, a developing type of
                    research is witnessed. The decentering of research disallows
                    a simplistic understanding of meaning or authorial intent
                    and instead focuses on the materiality as well as the

                        American consumption is in the "technology of reproduction itself." This can
                        be applied to the discourse surrounding reproduction of
                        scripts and texts on Internet forums and sites that
                        compile various editions. Through a weekly column

                        styles, including types of word processing programs and

                        on this technique: "If you type the
                            description in upper case, you can just put the caps
                            lock on and bash away, without worrying about the
                            niceties of capitalization at the start of
                            sentences. Having dialogue in lower case
                            differentiates it from the description, obviously.
                            More importantly, it means that you can use caps for
                            bold and don't have to bother going back and
                            underlining. It's a typewriter thing." By
                        identifying a typewriter mentality comparative to
                        digital writing, the digital edition loses authorial
                        power for the reader scrolling through reproduced

                        becomes integrated into the increasing ephemerality of
                        the digital. There is no definite time mark attributed
                        to these pieces except for the posting date, nor is

                        For example, did Campbell retype the script on Microsoft
                        Word and copy and paste it into a WordPress text box, or
                        did he type it directly into html of the webpage?
                        Changes in the coding between html and Microsoft Word
                        can alter the text itself and thus the lack of
                        information about composition subverts the notion of
                        authorship by creating ambiguity about authenticity and
                        translation.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">Also available on the webpage is the ability for users to

                        realness echoes through these documents and is
                        manifested in part by the anonymity associated with the
                        digital era, e.g. Internet communities. It functions
                        through nostalgic relations and associations but
                        ultimately transfigures the relationship between writer
                        and text through the digital. Errors create not only
                        organizational patterns but emotional imprints.
                        Sentimentality of errors galvanizes identification of
                        authors; it makes them human and relatable, something
                        which is in opposition to the anonymity the Internet
                        offers. By simplifying discursive rules to sets of
                        errors, authors past appear easier to access as cult
                        figures than those of the future who manuscripts are
                        purely digitally composed. Moore now uses Microsoft Word
                        to create his scripts (2000a), but his process is kept
                        invisible by comic book publishers, thwarting
                        transparency of authorship. The Internet offers an
                        alternate possibility for writer-reader interaction by
                        allowing this transparency to pass at the risk of
                        anonymity.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">The errors and marks leave traces just as emails are

                        forensics produces. What a digital forensics reading of
                        these images offers is insight into the production
                        process and the types of implications scanned or

                        how digital text asserts authority in comparison to
                        printed work. In both examples it is in the conditions
                        around a text, not the actual text itself, which mediate
                        our experiences with nostalgia, capitalism and
