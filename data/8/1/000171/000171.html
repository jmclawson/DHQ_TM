                    summarizes Moretti’s major arguments within the larger context of recent debates
                    in the digital humanities. Particular attention is given to Moretti’s uptake of
                    Immanuel Wallerstein, to his controversial critique of close reading, and to the
                    variety of digital-humanistic methods that comprise Moretti’s quantitative
                    formalism. Most valuable as an artifact of literary-critical history rather than
                    a how-to guide or theoretical treatise, this hodgepodge of essays is at its best
                    as an audacious and defensive academic memoir tracing Moretti’s transformation
                    into a digital humanist. As Moretti champions the broad explanatory power of
                    quantitative literary analysis, he overestimates the scientific objectivity of
                    his analyses while undervaluing the productively suggestive stories of doubt,
                    failure, and compromise that lend nuance and depth to his hypotheses. Combative,
                    absorbing, highly topical, and unevenly persuasive, <cite class="title italic">Distant
                        Reading</cite> embodies both the optimism of early digital literary studies
                    and its perils.</p></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Buried three-quarters into Franco Moretti’s <cite class="title italic">Distant
                    Reading</cite> is a moment of astonishment. Breaking for a moment out of the
                tone of unruffled calmness that sustains most of the collected essays in this new
                release from Verso, Moretti marvels at a cloud of data he produced by comparing no
                fewer than 7,000 titles of British novels from 1740-1950: "all you can see are swarms of hybrids and oddities, for
                        which the categories of literary taxonomy offer very little help. It’s
                        fascinating, to feel so lost in a universe one didn’t even know
                        existed" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 181]. If this passage beautifully conveys that stunning moment in which
                quantitative data and qualitative analysis merge, resolving into a single network,
                it also conveys a sense of loss, of regret. Tellingly, Moretti’s self-imposed
                alienation — he recounts a powerful personal experience in the second person:
                    <em class="emph">you</em>, <em class="emph">one</em> — betrays an anxiety with his own
                digital-humanistic method of distant reading, so "very
                    different," he reflects, "from the reading I used to know" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 65]. This mixed emotion may sound out of key upon taking a step back to consider
                this moment of ascendance for DH (digital humanities), which has recently attracted
                so much recognition from national news outlets, university administrations, and
                scholarly journals and presses, and (if for the moment) an array of job openings and
                funding opportunities. But if we approach <cite class="title italic">Distant
                    Reading</cite> through this one conflicted pause, we can use it in turn to
                approach the divisive conceptual apparatuses that structure DH meta-discourse at
                present. It is exactly this conflict rhetoric that we must re-examine if we want to
                avoid becoming the kind of sideshow that can distract institutions as they
                perennially search for the next new thing. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The digital humanities are at a rhetorical and institutional crossroads, having just
                enough critical mass of public attention to warrant a torrent of speculation. As
                Alan Liu has termed it, DH — at first "a loose suspension of
                    topics and approaches" — has undergone a period of "integration" and "expansion" that leads to
                the current "tipping point where it has the potential not just to
                        facilitate the work of the humanities but represent the state of the
                        humanities at large in its changing relation to higher education in the
                        postindustrial state" [<a class="ref" href="#liu2011">Liu 2011</a>, 8]. This moment of opportunity is equally a moment of danger, Liu cautions, as
                DH must avoid being caught in a web of neo-liberal bureaucratic imperatives — a
                danger highlighted, for example, by Wendy Chun, Richard Grusin, Patrick Jagoda, and
                Rita Raley in their "The Dark Side of the Digital
                    Humanities" panel at MLA 2013 [<a class="ref" href="#chun2013">Chun et al. 2013</a>], and by Matthew
                Gold’s recent collection <cite class="title italic">Debates in the Digital
                    Humanities</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#gold2012">Gold 2012</a>]. Such worries have highlighted the conflict rhetoric
                characterizing DH meta-discourse — with its familiar debates about distant versus
                close reading, about tool builders versus tool users, about rejecting versus
                incorporating theory, about using DH skills to be helpful around the office versus
                being more protective of our time. What unites these debates is the common tension
                between, on the one hand, desiring the fertility and excitement created by the
                coexistence of a diversity of approaches and interactions among very
                differently-minded scholars and, on the other, fearing that collaboration-related
                compromises could devalue DH work, subsequently re-marginalizing DH workers. To
                achieve the former and avoid the latter, we must find a way out of this
                (increasingly) stale conflict rhetoric, which tends to reify false binaries, thereby
                creating obstacles out of uncertainties and talking points out of ambiguities. By
                understanding <cite class="title italic">Distant Reading</cite> as a miniature archive
                that preserves this process of uncertainty and reification, we can become more aware
                of this process — and can help interrupt it.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3"><cite class="title italic">Distant Reading</cite> is most usefully understood as a
                document of development and transformation, a journey that tells the story of Franco
                Moretti becoming digital. The chapters have all been presented or published
                elsewhere, but each essay’s fascinating prefatory explanation makes the book an
                artifact of literary-critical history, rescuing the book from charges of being
                little more than a fulfillment of his contractual obligations to Verso. Each preface
                provides a key, a narrative kernel explaining the provenance of the essay — its
                goals, its rhetorical occasion, its relationships with the other chapters — and,
                more interesting still, evaluates its success or failure. He reconstructs his
                journey as a comparatist interested in evolutionary theory (<cite class="title italic">Modern European Literature</cite>, 1992) and in mapping (<cite class="title italic">Atlas of the European Novel 1800-1900</cite>, 1998), slowly piecing these
                areas into a "quantitative analysis" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2007">Moretti 2007</a>]. While <cite class="title italic">Graphs, Maps, Trees</cite> can serve as a
                methodological primer, it is in <cite class="title italic">Distant Reading</cite> that
                Moretti shifts focus from turning literature into datasets to the affordances of
                doing so. Perhaps not coincidentally, it is in this book that he avoids
                acknowledging his debt to narratology — making his methods seem more revolutionary
                than they perhaps are. But he does offer an alternative context: "In the last few years, literary studies have experienced
                        what we could call the rise of quantitative evidence. This had happened
                        before of course, without producing lasting effects, but this time is
                        probably going to be different, because this time we have digital databases
                        and automatic data retrieval" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 212]. Fitting snugly alongside the rise of the quantitative humanities — or at
                least an increased willingness to consider that literature is a kind of data and can
                therefore be translated into other forms of data — Moretti’s career trajectory
                models a kind of alternate academic history in which the digital humanities
                developed organically from within traditional methods of scholarship. Though such a
                simple, uninterrupted development is at best atypical and at worst disingenuous, it
                is compelling as an anti-conflict narrative that emphasizes the shared goals of the
                    "traditional" academy and DH.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Put simply, Moretti’s distant reading involves sampling from a buffet of "visualization tools" that convert any given slice of
                literary history into "a set of two-dimensional signs...that can be grasped at a
                        single glance" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 211]. Put more controversially, he claims that eschewing close reading is not only
                a positive change for the humanities, but is actually "<em class="emph">a condition of knowledge</em>" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 48]. Moretti then defines knowledge as pinpointing and explaining temporal and
                national variations in "devices, themes, tropes — or genres and systems" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 49]. Curiously, once Moretti does away with close reading, the first thing he
                does, as if scared by the resulting vacuum, is usher in Immanual Wallerstein’s
                world-systems analysis [<a class="ref" href="#wallerstein2004">Wallerstein 2004</a>]. Moretti’s preoccupation
                with evolution, the "study of formal mutation and cultural selection" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 63], finds in Wallerstein’s world-systems theory "a strong
                    conceptual model" even though "no one seemed to use [it] anymore" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 43]. Moretti's first two chapters, "Modern European
                    Literature: A Geographical Sketch" and "Conjectures
                    on World Literature," as well as the related chapters "More Conjectures on World Literature" and "Evolution, World-Systems, <em class="term">Weltliteratur</em>," use Wallerstein as a glue for combining
                evolutionary theory and DH techniques. In these chapters he traces a spatial (rather
                than temporal) evolution of literature as an unfolding constellation of "formal novelties" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 41] radiating out of many points. This approach has been criticized for
                overstating the influence of market demands on world literature, but, structurally,
                the true weakness of <cite class="title italic">Distant Reading</cite> is that five of
                its ten chapters deal heavily with world-systems analysis even though this is,
                putatively, not a book about Wallerstein but about distant reading. This
                inconsistency could have been cleared up with a theoretical introduction that
                explicitly situated (and defended) the relationship between distant reading and
                world-systems analysis, but Moretti provides no such introduction, leaving the
                reader with the choice either to construct an integrated argument from statements
                scattered in various chapters, or to ignore either the Wallersteinian or the
                digital-humanistic chapters.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Of the digital-humanistic chapters, the ambitiously titled "The
                    Novel, History and Theory" most dramatically suggests quantitative
                formalism’s potential. In it, Moretti uses functional magnetic resonance imagery to
                displace European realism’s literary-critical hegemony, making the literary field "historically longer, geographically larger, and
                        morphologically deeper" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 161] — an effort admirably connected to recent attempts to destabilize
                nationalistic models of literary periodization by scholars like Susan Stanford
                Friedman, Rebecca L. Walkowitz, and Eric Hayot. The following chapters are also
                impressive in their ambition; "The Slaughterhouse of
                    Literature" describes how Moretti and his graduate students read
                    <em class="emph">all</em> British detective narratives within a certain period to discern
                which stylistic features distinguish the canonical from the non-canonical, while
                    "Planet Hollywood" claims to prove how "plot and style [are] becoming manifestly de-coupled as a
                        result of their movement (or not) in space" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 92]. And the final chapter, in what is clearly <cite class="title italic">Distant
                    Reading</cite>’s signature interpretation, converts <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite> into a series of character-networks to discover that the hidden
                protagonist of the play is the nascent European international state system. Moretti
                makes no secret of his basic gambit: the reader can easily supply the silent "before me" in his observation that "we have never really tried to read the entire volume of the
                        literary past" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 210]. Indeed, making the impossible seem possible (and desirable) is what Moretti
                does best. And his tone of relaxed omniscience is at times seductive. But when he
                claims that his grandiose stories are "resting solidly on facts" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 44] or that distant reading yields "the clarity of the empirical confirmation," [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 92] the generalization-spouting bravado by which Moretti skates over impossibly
                broad terrain finally comes across as glib, revealing one of the primary dangers of
                digital literary studies to be the adoption of an aggrandized, even hubristic
                attitude toward literature as so much inert <em class="emph">stuff</em> being poked at. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">At the same time, this inertness seems to connote a fresh impartiality, a promise of
                neutrality and newness, even as it suggests another, more familiar controversial
                tendency of quantitative analysis: that it can become "a
                    patchwork of other people’s research, <em class="emph">without a single direct textual
                        reading</em>." For Moretti this is no problem, as he argues that
                the "ambition" or scope of the literary-critical project
                is "directly proportional <em class="emph">to the distance from the
                            text</em>: the more ambitious the project, the greater must the
                        distance be" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 48]. Haters left unconvinced are dealt with in a clever but catty passage that
                accuses close readers of pro-canon elitism: <blockquote><p>The United States is the country of close reading, so I
                        don’t expect this idea to be particularly popular. But the trouble with
                        close reading (in all of its incarnations, from the new criticism to
                        deconstruction) is that it necessarily depends on an extremely small canon.
                        This may have become an unconscious and invisible premise by now, but it is
                        an iron one nonetheless: you invest so much in individual texts
                            <em class="emph">only</em> if you think that very few of them really
                        matter. [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 48]</p></blockquote> Though Moretti’s all-or-nothing rhetoric is extreme — and his "<em class="emph">only</em>" far from earned — he is not alone
                contrasting new DH methods with close reading; Lev Manovich has called databases and
                narratives "natural enemies" [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2001">Manovich 2001</a>, 225], while Edward Whitley coolly assumes that literary critics "value close reading...over the broad brushstrokes of
                        information visualization" [<a class="ref" href="#whitley2011">Whitley 2011</a>, 188], and Matthew Wilkens serenely owns that "we’ll almost certainly become worse close readers" [<a class="ref" href="#wilkens2012">Wilkens 2012</a>, 256]. Yet David Hoover has complained in <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> of DH’s
                    "marginalization of textual analysis and other text-centered
                    approaches" despite "the tremendous potential of electronic texts for literary
                        studies" [<a class="ref" href="#hoover2007">Hoover 2007</a>, para. 4]. And when Stephen Ramsay observes that "[t]he digital revolution, for all its wonders, has not
                        penetrated the core activity of literary studies" [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2008">Ramsay 2008</a>, 477], his real claim is that it has not <em class="emph">yet</em> been done, not that it
                    <em class="emph">cannot</em> happen. Even distant reading does not work by
                    <em class="emph">not</em> reading: more accurately, Moretti means selective reading
                (reading only the titles, only the first paragraphs, or scanning for certain
                patterns), delegated reading (recruiting his graduate students), or mediated reading
                (using search tools to generate statistics and charts). Furthermore, though Moretti
                uses DH to generate grand systems of literature, these methods can also be used to
                return to the text — particularly if we link them to the "surface reading" of Heather Love, Stephen Best, and Sharon Marcus, as
                seen in the special issue of <cite class="title italic">Representations</cite> devoted to
                it and by Love’s "Close but not Deep"[<a class="ref" href="#love2010">Love 2010</a>]. Best and Marcus’s introduction links new strands in
                literary criticism (including DH, actor-network theory, and new approaches in
                narratology) as evidence of an emerging preference for descriptions of "the complexity of literary surfaces" instead of a
                psychoanalytically, historically, or politically inflected "symptomatic" method that "assumes that a text’s truest meaning lies in what it does
                        not say" [<a class="ref" href="#best-marcus2009">Best and Marcus 2009</a>, 1]. It may be more accurate to say that surface reading, distant reading, and DH
                do not oppose close reading <em class="term">per se</em>, but rather certain
                kinds of interpretation habitually associated with (but not inherent to) close
                reading. Pursuing these new forms of analysis does not automatically exclude close
                attention to the sentence-level details of form and style; indeed, moving back and
                forth between the microscopy of close reading and the wide-angle lens of distant
                reading would enrich both methods, creating a dual perspective that boasts both
                specificity and significance.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">If the text of <cite class="title italic">Distant Reading</cite> is confidence, its
                subtext is failure. Moretti repeatedly, generously, though fleetingly faces being
                wrong. He admits some of his work "may well have overstated its case" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 119], muses at another juncture "I may be exaggerating here," [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 228], and laments that his lack of technical skills drove him to hand-draw his
                visualizations in the early stages of distant reading. "This is
                    not a long-term solution, of course," he remarks of the hand drawings,
                but instead a characteristic of "the childhood of network theory for literature; a brief
                        happiness, before the stern adulthood of statistics" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 215]. But such "failures" are only a problem if we
                deprecate the "brief happiness" and make post-haste for
                that "stern adulthood," if we demand absolute truth and
                methods sanitized from any taint of non-DH methods. Unfairly deprecating to himself
                and his graduate students in this section, Moretti undervalues how his book
                successfully records select "home grown" digital literary
                studies, and as a result, <cite class="title italic">Distant Reading</cite> builds fences
                around them. What if instead we privilege openness and adopt the ad hoc playfulness
                of open-source programming, recognizing that systems and theories and methods are
                but temporary scaffolding, not the grand erection of something permanent and
                totalizing? Digital projects are often ends in themselves, not means — sometimes
                forgotten, fragmented, bug-ridden, and incomplete — but what is open is less likely
                to get bogged down in the past. To be open does not automatically entail the "technological hipsterism" that Amanda Gailey and Andrew
                Jewell warn of, that neurotic coolness that regards "the quality of work...not so important as staying at the
                        edge of innovation" [<a class="ref" href="#gailey-jewell2012">Gailey and Jewell 2012</a>, 5].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Ultimately, Moretti needs to take his own advice: he reasons, "since no one knows what knowledge will mean in literary
                        studies ten years from now, our best chance lies in the radical diversity of
                        intellectual positions" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 89]. As he concludes the book, he ends with a warning that before quantitative
                analysis can begin in earnest, "an enormous amount of empirical data must be first put
                        together. Will we, as a discipline, be capable of sharing raw materials,
                        evidence — <em class="emph">facts</em> — with each other? It remains to be
                        seen" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 240]. While the creation of (and access to) complete literary archives and data
                sets will certainly meet with obstacles, <cite class="title italic">Distant
                    Reading</cite> conjures a very different specter: overestimating the power of
                data and in doing so losing the texture and feel of the objects we study, setting
                ourselves up as so many Carmen Sandiegos: megalomaniacs hoarding what is impossible
                to hoard. It is better to seek the moments like the one opening this review, in
                which Moretti felt awed, "so lost in a universe" filled
                with "swarms of hybrids and oddities" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2013">Moretti 2013</a>, 181] — moments of suspension that suggest that it is not the
                    "knowledge" that results, but rather our <em class="emph">wonder</em>
                while encountering a new dataset that makes DH methods so attractive. Similarly, the
                conflict rhetoric of DH meta-discourse tends to suspend, rather than resolve, its
                favorite debates, putting off the agony of saying that DH is one thing rather than
                another, preferring instead to work inside the "what if" and the
                maybe, the conditional and the subjunctive, rather than inside absolutes and
                interdictions. Perhaps we should also preserve that moment of suspension when we
                manipulate our data.</div></div><div id="worksCited"><h2>Works Cited</h2><div class="bibl fallback"><span class="ref" id="best-marcus2009"><!-- close -->Best and Marcus 2009</span>  Best, Stephen, and
