                    the discipline across broad scholarly and administrative contexts. It will
                    succeed in its aims if it is both comprehensible to newcomers and stimulating
                    for experienced practitioners: a "bridging" effort, but one
                    undertaken with serious intent. It proceeds by isolating a key debate for
                    examination, describing two concepts that go a significant distance to solving
                    issues raised by that debate (but not far enough), and exploring the theoretical
                    writings of a selection of high profile digital humanists. The goal (a
                    non-trivial undertaking) is to illustrate the utility of postfoundationalism as
                    a conceptual tool, its interdependence with postindustrial culture, and the
                    light it sheds on our understanding of what "DH" is. If successful the
                    article, rather than making an essentialist claim that "Digital Humanities is defined by postfoundational method," will
                    constitute a contribution to the developing digital humanities
                        "agenda."</p></div><a class="noteRef" href="#d23602e99">[1]</a><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Preparatory</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">This article seeks to explore concepts of significance to the broader Humanities
                    community, and in so doing graft them into the main trunk of Digital Humanities
                    theory and method. This makes a position statement useful. The argument that
                    follows reflects an approach to Digital Humanities (and a view of Digital
                    Humanities) oriented towards the Humanities Computing tradition and what Patrick
                    Svensson would refer to as the "technology as tool" [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2010">Svensson 2010</a>, 24] approach to the field. Because of this, it risks hypostasizing what is
                    only a thesis into a statement of intent, or worse, a totalizing claim that the
                    ground of our discipline is of a particular (rather than multivariate) nature.
                    That would be an unsupportable, and unproductive, approach. That said, it
                        <em class="emph">is</em> my hope that the article provides additional intellectual
                    justification for a turn to code-craft practices outlined at the Speaking in
                    Code workshop at the University of Virginia’s Scholars’ Lab in 2013 [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2013">Nowviskie et al. 2013</a>], and the adoption of a mindset broadly
                    commensurate with digital artisanship. That topic requires further exploration,
                    and is somewhat peripheral to this present article, but is important to keep in
                    mind: as a scholarly discipline we require conceptual anchors and an openness to
                    theories and methods borrowed from cognate disciplines, but in our daily
                    practice digital humanists are reminded of the importance of craft and the value
                    of tacit knowledge. It is my contention, even accepting my own rudimentary craft
                    skills, that this is where the discipline has the most to offer the broader
                    Humanities community. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">It is counter-productive, however, to ignore the field’s entanglement with
                    postindustrial culture, the rise of technocratic and neoliberal modes of
                    government, and the so-called "crisis in the humanities" that
                    has seen Humanities disciplines struggle with policy decisions weighted in favor
                    of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines [<a class="ref" href="#donoghue2008">Donoghue 2008</a>][<a class="ref" href="#menand2010">Menand 2010</a>]. Although a complex soup, this comprises the
                    post-World War Two cultural, intellectual and technological background to the
                    field: it is an important part of our heritage as a community. And while it is
                    perhaps of more interest to intellectual and cultural historians than digital
                    humanists per se, it provides essential context — even, perhaps, an ontological
                    ground — that is important to parse if we are to understand the purpose and
                    potential of the field. This is especially so if it is accepted that the "crisis in the Humanities," whether real or imagined
                        [<a class="ref" href="#schmidt2013">Schmidt 2013</a>], is related to deeper epistemological problems
                    connected to the relative value of scientific and humanistic modes of knowledge
                    creation. This issue touches on issues of fundamental importance for the
                    scholarly community: while there is none of the sense of revolution that
                    accompanied the "culture wars" of the latter twentieth
                    century, some scholars are questioning the binary opposition of foundationalist
                    and anti-foundationalist modes of knowledge creation, symbolized most starkly in
                    logical positivism on the one hand and postmodern relativism on the other. This
                    paper follows G.B. Madison [<a class="ref" href="#madison1991">Madison 1991</a>], J. Wentzel Van
                    Huyssteen [<a class="ref" href="#vanhuyssteen2000">Van Huyssteen 2000</a>], Paul Healy [<a class="ref" href="#healy2005">Healy 2005</a>][<a class="ref" href="#healy2007">Healy 2007</a>], Dimitri Ginev [<a class="ref" href="#ginev2001">Ginev 2001</a>][<a class="ref" href="#ginev2007">Ginev 2007</a>], and Mark Bevir [<a class="ref" href="#bevir2011a">Bevir 2011a</a>][<a class="ref" href="#bevir2011b">Bevir 2011b</a>] in labeling this effort
                        "postfoundationalism."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">These writers are searching for a "non-defeatist" [<a class="ref" href="#healy2007">Healy 2007</a>, 137] epistemological stance, one that rejects Cartesian foundationalism as
                    unattainable but remains capable of underwriting "the truth-value of our interpretations" [<a class="ref" href="#madison1991">Madison 1991</a>, 23]. The issue speaks to a broader impulse to seek methods that are "<em class="emph">neither</em> foundationalist <em class="emph">nor</em>
                            relativist" [<a class="ref" href="#madison1991">Madison 1991</a>, 24], but still capable of advancing knowledge. In his recent book on the use
                    of the R programming language for literary study, digital humanist Matthew
                    Jockers touched on something similar when he noted that methods described in his
                    book reflect a post-Popperian stance somewhere "between strict positivism and strict relativism" [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, viii]. Jocker’s mention of post-positivism represents an important statement
                    given its associations with method in the hard and social sciences, and is
                    deserving of further exploration, but it is outside the scope of this article.
                    Post-positivism does indeed hold significant opportunities for digital humanists
                    working with methods derived from or closely associated to the computer and
                    social sciences, but the argument that follows treads a fine line between
                    researchers like Jockers whose work draws them towards methods prominent in
                    those consciously "scientific" disciplines, and others who
                    are more focused on cultural theory and critique. Its goal is to explore the
                    possibilities inherent in a "bridging" concept
                    (postfoundationalism) that might work equally well for all sectors of the
                    community. If successful it will be broadly agreeable to both ends of our
                    disciplinary spectrum; if unsuccessful it may well disappoint all parties. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Because of its engagement with issues of epistemology and method, there is a need
                    to navigate terrain familiar to historians of ideas: on the one hand the
                    argument must avoid the kind of "unit-ideas"
                    approach, popular with mid-twentieth century historians like A.O. Lovejoy, which
                    enumerates ideas as a record of in-group culture [<a class="ref" href="#grafton2006">Grafton 2006</a>, 2–3], and on the other it must not assume to comprehend the "inside" of actors’ minds [<a class="ref" href="#burns2006">Burns 2006</a>][<a class="ref" href="#olsen1993">Olsen 1993</a>]. These methodological issues are considerable, and
                    the article’s conclusions should certainly be weighed against them, but if
                    comments like Jockers’ reveal a dawning orientation for the field as a whole
                    there are many threads to pull: intellectual, cultural, historical as well as
                    theoretical and methodological. It will be enough if this present article is
                    agreed to be a useful contribution to that process.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Another problem is, of course, that any analysis of the digital humanities must
                    traverse vast distances. Brett Bobley, CIO and Director of the U.S. National
                    Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Office of Digital Humanities (ODH), has
                    presented a fabulously broad definition of the field that illustrates this issue
                    well: <blockquote><p>I use "digital humanities" as an umbrella term for
                            a number of different activities that surround technology and humanities
                            scholarship. Under the digital humanities rubric, I would include topics
                            like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool
                            development, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation,
                            multimedia publication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction,
                            study of the impact of technology on numerous fields, technology for
                            teaching and learning, sustainability models, media studies, and many
                            others. [<a class="ref" href="#gavin2012">Gavin et al. 2012</a>, 61]</p></blockquote> This is well and good and, ignoring for the moment people who would
                    strongly disagree with such a broad statement, useful in its Catholicism. But it
                    makes the task of "defining the digital humanities"
                    difficult [<a class="ref" href="#terras2013">Terras et al. 2013</a>]. Even if there is no great desire to
                    define a "discipline" in the traditional sense of the term,
                    the field needs to find intellectual levers that can make sense of a very broad
                    definitional continuum, and explain to stakeholders what DH is, how it is
                    connected to the current difficulties encountered by the humanities, how it is
                    connected to broader postindustrial culture, and how technical DH outputs should
                    be assessed. Without answers to these issues the field is unlikely to gain
                    either high levels of student engagement, or a portion of increasingly
                    competitive funding sources. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Postfoundationalism is one such intellectual lever, but the centrality of it to
                    this article should not suggest it is universally applicable, or unproblematic
                    as a concept and label: it could perhaps sit under "P" alongside hundreds
                    of other similar concepts in a <cite class="title italic">Dictionary of DH
                        Terms</cite>, but it is enough to hope that it can serve the purposes of
                    this article and provide entry to the conceptual domain I aim to navigate. It
                    will not be useful for all digital humanists, or be applicable to all DH
                    practices. It certainly shouldn’t be accepted uncritically as a "unit-idea" in the Lovejoyian sense. It is, however,
                    well-suited to an exploration of the epistemological implications of Svensson’s "technology as tool" [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2010">Svensson 2010</a>, 24] approach to the digital humanities, which focuses on building digital
                    outputs ahead of engaging in more traditional humanistic pursuits related to
                    interpretation and critique. Because of this the "technology
                        as tool" approach tends to produce non-traditional scholarly outputs
                    like web archives, ontologies, data models, and suchlike. Indeed, much of what
                    follows is informed by development of the UC CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquakes

                    challenging task, which isn’t helped by the relative lack of conceptual work
                    across the community. Jan Christoph Meister has suggested that "the amount of energy that our community invests into
                        theoretical and methodological critique of its practices and their
                        limitations is still disproportionally low," resulting in a lack of
                    understanding about what a "shared methodology" for
                    the field might look like [<a class="ref" href="#meister2012">Meister 2012</a>]. Meister’s comment is
                    perhaps slightly out of date given the recent debates related to
                        "defining DH" (one of which will be examined in detail
                    later in this paper), and it ignores significant conceptual work undertaken by
                    projects like the United Kingdom’s AHRC funded ICT Methods Network (AHRC 2005 –
                    2008) and various communities of practice (TEI, manuscript studies, epigraphy,
                    computational linguistics) but his underlying premise remains valid. There is a
                    need to explain in scholarly terms what key concepts carry weight for digital
                    humanists, and how the field and its associated theories, methods, practices,
                    and outputs relate to broader currents in intellectual culture. It is only by
                    positioning the field in the context of broader scholarly discourses and
                    processes driving the contemporary academic knowledge economy — by defining a
                        "shared methodology" — that a solid claim can be made for
                    long-term institutional investment in it. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">This article therefore articulates a view of the digital humanities that hopes to
                    advance the discipline across broad academic and scholarly contexts. It will
                    succeed in its aims if it is both comprehensible to newcomers and stimulating
                    for experienced practitioners: a "bridging" effort, but one
                    undertaken with serious intent. It proceeds by isolating a key debate for
                    examination, describing two concepts that go a significant distance to solving
                    issues raised by that debate (but not far enough), and exploring the theoretical
                    writings of a selection of high profile digital humanists. The goal (a
                    non-trivial undertaking) is to illustrate the utility of postfoundationalism as
                    a conceptual tool, its interdependence with postindustrial culture, and the
                    light it sheds on our understanding of what "DH" is. If successful, the
                    article, rather than making an essentialist claim that "Digital Humanities is defined by postfoundational method," will
                    constitute a contribution to the developing digital humanities
                        "agenda": <blockquote><p>A field’s agenda consists of what its practitioners
                            agree ought to be done, a consensus concerning the field’s problems,
                            their order of importance, the means of solving them (the tools of the
                            trade), and perhaps most importantly, what constitutes a solution.
                            Becoming a recognized practitioner means learning the agenda and helping
                            to carry it out. [<a class="ref" href="#mahoney2004">Mahoney 2004</a>, 9]</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The DH Moment</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">In his introduction to <cite class="title italic">Debates in the Digital

                            purpose of the university system" [<a class="ref" href="#gold2012">Gold 2012</a>, ix]. As the discipline develops, these questions of cultural and intellectual

                    issue again and again, making it difficult to explain (and therefore justify)
                    the field to university management. Some digital humanists view attempts to
                    divide practitioners into two separate camps as futile, but in practice it’s
                    easier to posit a simple binary opposition: if the field orients itself towards
                    text encoding, computer programming, and producing IT products it is presumed to
                    need to align towards the sciences, engineering, and empirically-oriented
                    humanities and social sciences; if it orients itself towards Theory it is
                    presumed to need to align towards literary and cultural studies. The reality is
                    far more complex than that (text encoding is a classic example, where technical
                    issues are inextricably tied to both theory and knowledge context), but it is a
                    level of complexity that’s difficult to convey to senior scholars and peers in
                    cognate disciplines and service areas, so the dichotomy assumes more
                    significance than it deserves. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">There are some indications that the global community is incapable of pointing the
                    way to a workable compromise. Patrik Svensson has suggested that DH is a "twenty-first-century humanities project driven by frustration,
                        dissatisfaction, epistemic tension, everyday practice, technological vision,
                        disciplinary challenges, institutional traction, hope, ideals and strong
                        visions" — hardly a situation conducive to clear articulations of
                    intellectual purpose and antecedent [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2011">Svensson 2011</a>, 42]. Alan
                    Liu has admitted that he fears: <blockquote><p>the digital humanities are not ready to take up their
                            full responsibility [to reinvigorate the Humanities] because the field
                            does not yet possess an adequate critical awareness of the larger
                            social, economic, and cultural issues at stake. [<a class="ref" href="#liu2011a">Liu 2011a</a>, 11]</p></blockquote> Liu’s argument is that this unpreparedness stems from a general
                    resistance to theorizing the deeper cultural significance of the discipline
                    across the DH community, in favor of building tools, systems and websites, and
                    programming code [<a class="ref" href="#liu2011b">Liu 2011b</a>]. Manfred Thaller probably wouldn’t
                    agree with that sentiment, but appears similarly frustrated about the
                    long-standing tension in the digital humanities over whether the discipline has "an intellectual agenda or […] constitute[s] an
                            infrastructure" [<a class="ref" href="#thaller2012">Thaller 2012</a>, 20]. In sanguine voice Willard McCarty has pointed out that "…complaints of stagnation and theoretical poverty…"
                    have followed the discipline since at least 1962 [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2012">McCarty 2012</a>, 27]. It is worth remembering in this context that the older
                    humanities computing tradition was not associated with what could be termed the
                        "main currents" of late twentieth century intellectual
                    culture. The heated debate surrounding Robert William Fogel and Stanley L.
                    Engerman’s <cite class="title italic">Time on the Cross: The Economics of American
                        Negro Slavery</cite> (1974) provides one example of how it could become
                    enmeshed in topical debates (in this case around cliometrics, or the use of
                    quantification in economic history), but humanities computing was not known for
                    its engagement with high-profile intellectual trends. Analysis of the <cite class="title italic">Humanist</cite> email seminar, run by Willard McCarty since
                    1987, backs this up [<a class="ref" href="#rockwellsinclair2012">Rockwell and Sinclair 2012</a>]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">This has changed in recent years as significant numbers of newcomers have joined

                        "technology as tool," and those supporting the broader
                    definition enabled by the ODH. The recent DH "theory debate"
                    is a case in point, and the example I have chosen to illustrate the utility of
                    postfoundationalism as a critical tool. While it is only one of several issues
                    that could be explored, it has been chosen here because it exposes a
                    particularly troubling issue. The discussion exposed the fault lines that
                    resulted from the rapid development of the humanities computing tradition into a
                    broader state-sanctioned "Digital Humanities" field in the United States.
                    While the locus of the debate was centered in the U.S., it resonated around the
                    international community and has particular significance for the field as it
                    expands into new regions of the world. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">The debate’s basic elements are well rehearsed. It took place over the course of
                    two years, and was conducted primarily amongst North American university-based
                    digital humanists. In an influential talk describing digital humanists’ values,
                    given at the CUNY Digital Humanities Initiative in 2010, Tom Scheinfeldt didn’t
                    mention theory, emphasizing coding and Do It Yourself (DIY) instead [<a class="ref" href="#scheinfeldt2010">Scheinfeldt 2010</a>]. At the time his emphasis seemed unproblematic.
                    At the 2011 MLA conference in Los Angeles, however, Stephen Ramsay put a finer
                    point on the issue by asking: <blockquote><p>Do you have to know how to
                        code? I’m a tenured professor of digital humanities and I say
                            "yes."</p></blockquote> He followed up by opining: <blockquote><p>But if you are not making anything, you are not — in my
                        less-than-three-minute opinion — a digital humanist.</p></blockquote> Ramsay later
                    softened his position, and has produced his own significant contribution to
                    digital literary theory, but his comment brought a challenging vein of digital
                    humanities discourse into the light of day. Some people were angered, and felt
                    that such a "brazen" attitude opened up a space for them to
                    air mounting grievances. The assumption was that Ramsay’s comment betrayed a
                    lingering prejudice across the discipline that equated the ability to write
                    computer code with hostility to Theory. This may or may not have been an unjust
                    conflation, but for whatever reason the association of coding with
                    anti-theoretical prejudice had become a touchstone issue. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">It’s easy for people outside the United States to forget that Alan Liu delivered
                    a paper at not only the same MLA conference as Ramsay, but also the same panel

                    computer programming at the expense of theory and cultural criticism) threatened
                    to throw away a crucial opportunity for digital humanists, their students, and
                    the wider tradition. Later in 2011 and the early months of 2012 the topic
                    yielded one of the richest intellectual debates outside <cite class="title italic">Humanist </cite>in the history of the discipline. The debate was prompted
                    by a blog post by a young American scholar, Natalia Cecire, who disagreed with "the zero-sum logic that it [an emphasis on coding]
                            implies" [<a class="ref" href="#cecire2011a">Cecire 2011a</a>]. Primed by a year’s worth of discussion resulting from Ramsay and Liu’s
                    comments at the MLA in January, a slew of posts and tweets on the topic
                    dominated digital humanities discourse for several weeks, before petering out
                    with a return to the status quo: hack over yack. Most digital humanists, it
                    seems, agreed with Tom Scheinfeldt, who tweeted that "DH arguments are encoded in code. I disagree with the
                            notion that those arguments must be translated / re-encoded in

                    University’s Roy Rosenzweig Centre for History and New Media in late 2011, was
                    devoted to the Theory problem. Natalia Cecire was invited to provide an
                    introduction, where she claimed that the hack versus yack divide had sundered
                    the connection between "saying and doing." Cecire
                    claimed that "hacking" represented a dominant
                    discourse across the discipline that celebrated tacit knowledge and valued only "embodied, experiential, extradiscursive epistemology”
                            at the expense of deeper philosophical, ethical, and economic
                            issues" [<a class="ref" href="#cecire2011b">Cecire 2011b</a>]. Although a far less emotive (and important) topic, it wasn’t unlike the
                    accusations directed at cliometricians like Fogel in the previous century: a
                    claim that positivism, and especially scientism masquerading as post-positivism,
                    becomes anathema to the Humanities when it excludes more traditional methods. In
                    her piece, Jean Bauer openly stated that she was "insulted" by these kinds of comments, which she felt betrayed a lack
                    of understanding about the design decisions required for DH products [<a class="ref" href="#bauer2011">Bauer 2011</a>]. Several other contributions were similarly forthright
                    in their defense of tacit knowledge. Fred Gibb came closest to mediating a way
                    forward by simply pointing out that "[p]art of what defines
                        a discipline is the rhetoric and aesthetics of its scholarly
                        discourse" and there are very real practical needs for the
                    development of DH-specific discourse, in order to evaluate scholarly outputs and
                    engage in other normal administrative tasks [<a class="ref" href="#gibbs2011">Gibbs 2011</a>]. Perhaps

                    probably only represented the further development within the U.S. digital
                    humanities movement (itself containing digital history, digital literary studies
                    etc.) of digital cultural studies, an event that had been presaged by the
                    pre-existence of digital media studies [<a class="ref" href="#mcpherson2009">McPherson 2009</a>], and
                    should have been welcomed as a sophisticated addition to the field. The fact
                    that it wasn’t points to one of the fundamental weaknesses in the movement:
                    consistent recourse to a category error that conflates the contributing fields
                    of the digital humanities with the (extra)discipline itself. The problem usually
                    appears with the conflation of DH with digital literary studies, rather than
                    digital cultural studies, to the point where it sometimes seems as if English
                    departments are "taking over" the field to the detriment of
                    digital history, classics and so on. Mathew G. Kirshenbaum devoted an essay to
                    the issue in 2010. Titled "What Is Digital humanities and
                        What’s It Doing in English Departments?," the piece noted that
                    English departments have "historically been hospitable
                        settings" for scholars interested in humanities computing, because of
                    their natural interest in text analysis and publishing [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2010">Kirschenbaum 2010</a>, 5]. Kirschenbaum was quite right in noting
                    this can only be a positive thing given the need for institutional support, but
                    DH has also been well supported in History and Classics departments and it would
                    be improper (and perhaps even absurd) for English departments to claim special
                    ownership of the field. If this was to happen there would not only be confusion
                    about what DH is, but digital historians and classists (etc.) might become
                    unwittingly mired in the famously heated debates characteristic of literary

                    hoping to prompt a campaign of <em class="term">apologia pro vita sua</em>
                    against DH, as Anthony Daniels has admitted to savoring [<a class="ref" href="#daniels2012">Daniels 2012</a>], but they were ill-served by their sources. Both
                    writers, after presumably cursory research into the digital humanities, assumed
                    that digital humanities equated to digital literary criticism and proceeded to
                    damn the entire subject-area for the (perceived) sins of this one contributing
                    area. Their argument against digital humanities revolved around the lack of
                    benefit in quantitative text analysis rather than the utility of historical GIS,
                    concordances of ancient texts, digital variorums, or transcriptions of
                    philosophical writings. If people involved in digital literary studies were
                    perplexed at the hostility, digital humanists from other fields were left
                    wondering why eminent literary scholars were damning their field without seeming
                    to know their specific area of it even existed. A cursory glance at the book of
                    abstracts for the primary ADHO conference would have alerted Fish et al. to
                    their mistake. In many ways it was an embarrassment for American literary
                    studies, as some of their finest betrayed a tendency to engage in heated
                    polemics in ignorance of elementary facts. The problem continued at the 2013 MLA
                    conference, with one panel discussion, titled "The Dark Side
                        of the Digital Humanities"[<a class="ref" href="#chun2013">Chun 2013</a>] generating ire for its participants’ conflation of DH
                    with the recent trends towards Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCS, which
                    digital humanists have been largely uninterested in (the topic is of more

                            world" [<a class="ref" href="#galeyandruecker2010">Galey and Ruecker 2010</a>, 406]. The argument proffered is that the need to create models of reality
                    (ontologies, database schemas, algorithms and so on), required to allow
                    computers to mathematically parse problems posed by their human operators,
                    offers a radical new methodological basis for future humanities research. Rather
                    than being merely an indication of computers’ inability to accommodate the
                    complexities of human thought and emotion, and by extension historical reality,
                    the suggestion is that the very inadequacies of the models — their propensity to
                    be radically inadequate, or at best only broadly reliable — suggest a new way of
                    looking at the world that is at once accepting of failure, more in tune with
                    scientific method, and oriented towards <em class="emph">process</em> instead of Truth: <blockquote><p>Computational form, which accepts only that which can be
                            told with programmatic explicitness and precision, is thus radically
                            inadequate for representing the full range of knowledge — hence useful
                            for locating what gets lost when we try to specify the
                            unspecifiable. [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2005">McCarty 2005</a>, 25]</p></blockquote> Ramsay and Rockwell interpret this to mean that we need to develop a
                        "humanistically informed theory of the
                            <em class="emph">making</em> of technology," an epistemology of building
                    that provides scholarly justification for DH outputs in a way that makes sense
                    to our peers in cognate disciplines [<a class="ref" href="#ramsayandrockwell2012">Ramsay and Rockwell 2012</a>]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">Although there are notable exceptions, such as McCarty’s modeling of Ovid’s

                    epistemology of building is that they threaten to float free of the broader
                    humanities tradition. Commentators like Liu and Cecire might argue that, as
                    Allen Tate said of the American Southern Critics, they are locked in the present
                    and cut off from the "benefit of the fund of traditional wisdom" [<a class="ref" href="#tate1957">Tate 1945</a>, 325] that has dealt with similar problems before. Without arguing specifically
                    for more critical or cultural theory, David Berry suggests something similar
                    when he comments that digital humanists need to problematize <blockquote><p>what Lakatos (1980) would have called the
                                "hard-core" of the humanities, the unspoken assumptions and
                            ontological foundations which support the ‘normal’ research that
                            humanities scholars undertake on an everyday basis. [<a class="ref" href="#berry2011">Berry 2011</a>, 4]</p></blockquote> Following this line of argument, which is a powerful one, arguments for
                    more or less critical or cultural theory are simply components of a larger
                    problem. The hack versus yack debate means little in the context of a
                    2000-year-old tradition, after all. This isn’t to criticize the many excellent
                    scholars who have contributed to the discipline over the decades, or to ignore
                    the growing body of work (much of it cited in this article) that suggests growth
                    towards what Lakatos terms the ‘hard-core’ humanities. Any digital humanist who
                    has spent a considerable amount of time staring at code to work out a particular
                    problem will understand why this is easier said than done: the conceptual divide
                    that separates Computer Science and the Humanities is large, and it is natural
                    to only think in one of the two paradigms at any one time. Digital humanists
                    need bridging concepts, or concepts that work just as well for the digital
                    humanities as their analog cousins — levers capable of raising our conceptual
                    understanding to new levels.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Postfoundationalism</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Postfoundationalism holds promise as one of these levers. Although it is only one
                    of several that will be required, it offers our nascent "epistemology
                        of building" a useful tool. Mark Bevir points out that for
                    historians postfoundationalism has the great benefit of avoiding the simplistic
                    anchoring of explanation in pre-determined "facts" as with
                    modernist discourse, or the dissolution of fact into fiction characteristic of
                    postmodernism. Postfoundationalism asserts that there is no point asserting
                    either more confidence in our understanding of reality than is justified (as
                    with modernism and logical empiricism) or retreating into a pessimistic view of
                    our ability to grasp any one reality at all (as with postmodernism and
                    postmodern deconstruction) [<a class="ref" href="#ginev2001">Ginev 2001</a>, 28]. Rather, in a
                    claim that could perhaps be criticized for claiming to have cut the Gordian
                    knot, postfoundationalism "reject[s] the possibility of facts outside theoretical
                            contexts. All knowledge incorporates both facts and theories" [<a class="ref" href="#bevir2011a">Bevir 2011a</a>]. It is an intellectual position that balances a distrust of grand
                    narrative with an acceptance that methods honed over centuries and supported by
                    independently verified evidence can lead, if not to Truth itself, then closer to
                    it than we were before. Philosopher of science Dimitri Ginev notes that
                    postfoundationalism offers both a "hermeneutic ontology of
                        existence and a hermeneutic theory of historicity," and buttresses
                    itself by asserting the validity of both the research process <em class="emph">and</em>
                    the outputs of that research process [<a class="ref" href="#ginev2001">Ginev 2001</a>, 28].
                    Revealingly, Paul Healy suggests that postfoundational rationality aims to
                    develop a "situated learning" process conducive to
                    the accretion of knowledge, rather than either positivist or relativist "idealisations" [<a class="ref" href="#healy2007">Healy 2007</a>, 141]. Its devotees hope that it is capable of moving human knowledge and

                    accepting of complexity, but more optimistic and empirically oriented. Healy
                    neatly summarizes the resulting communicative domain in terms of disciplines
                    embracing <blockquote><p>a robust context-transcendent truth standard which, in

                            that proffered knowledge claims are held open to critical scrutiny in an
                            indefinitely extended array of situated forums. [<a class="ref" href="#healy2007">Healy 2007</a>, 143]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">The approach would seem to be well suited to a (trans)discipline like Digital
                    Humanities that runs the gamut from empirically oriented text analysis to the
                    development of database models and cultural critique. It could well be, because
                    it is a field so reliant on a similar hermeneutic, that the digital humanities
                    prove important to the development of postfoundationalism in the coming decades.
                    In straddling the humanities and computer science, and using methods derived
                    from fields as diverse as computational linguistics and sociology, its
                    practitioners are confronted with a need to re-envisage the nature and goals of
                    humanistic enquiry and method, in order to make sense of the radically different
                    questions they’re being confronted with. It makes sense to seek out different
                    new approaches to assist them in that task. Although it is essential that the
                    discipline looks to fields like computer science (and perhaps mathematics and
                    logic) before reinventing the wheel, the basic assumption must surely be that a
                    new problem domain is likely to require new theories as well as new methods. And
                    the parallels between emerging DH theory and postfoundationalism are easy to
                    illustrate. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">Few statements of method could suggest a postfoundational orientation better than

                    than final outcomes. By meditating on the procedures involved in the production
                    of electronic texts, from the inscription of bits onto hard-drive platters, to

                    programming languages, to presentation on our screens, Matthew G. Kirschenbaum
                    offers what could be seen as a postfoundationalist argument for critical
                    exegesis focused on process, "propagation," and
                    becoming, rather than the fixity of texts, screen, or image: <blockquote><p>New media cannot be studied apart from individual
                            instances of inscription, object, and code as they propagate on, across,

                    Endowment for the Humanities. They proposed the #alt-ac hashtag be used to
                    capture conversations about "alternative academic" careers,
                    and Nowviskie later established #Alt-Academy, an online collection of essays
                    about the subject. The digital humanities community, though their use of
                    Twitter, had prompted a significant protest against an unfair academic system,
                    and given voice to a large body of disenfranchised but important stakeholders.
                    The #alt-ac community continues to educate and advocate for change in both the
                    orientation of graduate students’ job searches, and the attitude of American
                    universities to adjunct faculty. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">It needs to be remembered that Twitter was by no means an accepted part of
                    academic culture in 2009; indeed, its appearance was met with similar concern
                    about the end of intellectual life as accompanied Wikipedia earlier in the
                    decade. Its use was being spear-headed by digital humanists who, rather than
                    seeing it as a threat to intellectual integrity and the ability of people to
                    read extended passages of prose, chose to view it as merely another useful
                    technology that could be used as part of their broader process: the service was
                    used by digital humanists to offset their geographic dispersal, share ideas and
                    new tools, and build an online community. In 2010, Tom Scheinfeldt went so far
                    as to point out that the use of services like Twitter went beyond the quotidian,
                    and were actually contributing to the development of a radically new mindset: <blockquote><p>In as much as digital humanities is an Internet-based
                            social network, it should come as no surprise that digital humanities
                            looks a lot like the Internet itself. Digital humanities takes more than
                            tools from the Internet. It works like the Internet. It takes its values
                            from the Internet. [<a class="ref" href="#scheinfeldt2010">Scheinfeldt 2010</a>]</p></blockquote> Digital Humanities is not only characterized by the <em class="emph">use</em> of
                    tools like Twitter (along with code, databases, ontologies etc.), it is
                    constituted by them; the discipline assimilates digital tools and methods to the
                    point where they become the thing itself. This is, of course, exactly what we
                    should expect in bringing technology into such a fundamental relationship to
                    scholarly activity. As Heidegger noted in 1949, technology is more than mere
                        <em class="term">techne</em>, or practical art: <blockquote><p>the manufacture and utilization of equipment, tools, and
                            machines, the manufactured and used things themselves, and the needs and
                            ends that they serve, all belong to what technology is. Technology
                            itself is a contrivance — in Latin, an <em class="term">instrumentum</em>. [<a class="ref" href="#heidegger1949">Heidegger 1978</a>, 288]</p></blockquote> As Galey and Ruecker noted in their contribution to the DH discussion
                    about the epistemology of building, tools like Twitter ‘contain arguments that
                    advance knowledge about the world’. In assimilating them into fundamental
                    humanistic practice, to the point where understanding of their essential
                    (engineered) nature is a requirement of participation in the debate, digital
                    humanists are engaging in a postfoundational process with far-reaching
                    consequences. A similar argument can be made for the fringe DH activity of
                    contributing to post-disaster cultural heritage archiving and recovery,
                    expressed in projects like the <cite class="title italic">September 11 Digital

                    humanists to become involved in, it doesn’t take much thought to realize that
                    the interventions of these teams was informed by a range of humanist thinking —
                    about civic responsibility, the importance of cultural memory, public history,
                    engaged scholarship — and that were it not for them significant amounts of
                    valuable cultural heritage content would have been lost. The teams’ scholarly
                    knowledge was put to use via postfoundational methods that resulted in

                    decade, from around 2001–2011, the digital humanities have moved from an
                    emphasis on technique (represented in the humanities computing tradition) to a

                    critically engaged projects outlined above, which indicate an acceptance of the

                    agendas focused on the analysis of corporate culture and power. <cite class="title italic">4Humanities</cite> reflects a response to this insight,
                    actively countering myths benefitting postindustrial technocrats with evidence

                    paradox of a supposedly booming new discipline producing insecure jobs, lacking
                    scholarly recognition, and requiring a constant search for funding. Chun claimed
                    she wasn’t criticizing the Digital Humanities so much as "the general euphoria surrounding technology and education" and the
                        "vapid embrace of the digital" that feeds into
                    the corporatism critiqued by Liu. Her compelling argument was that the
                    heightened interest in the digital humanities (the development of a
                        "bandwagon") "…allows us to believe that the problem facing our
                            students and our profession is a lack of technical savvy rather than an
                            economic system that undermines the future of our students" [<a class="ref" href="#chun2013">Chun 2013</a>]. Chun’s talk provided a moment of "stuplimity," a word
                    coined by Sianne Ngai to refer to those peculiarly modern moments when
                    wonderment gives way to "an extended duration of consecutive
                        fatigues": <blockquote><p>As in the case of the repeated pratfalls of the

                            fatigue-inducing strategies, in which the gradual accumulation of error
                            often leads to the repetition of a refrain: "too strong"; or

                    awareness of the kind of cultural critique practiced by Liu. She was pointing
                    out that the hype associated with the digital humanities shouldn’t (or shouldn’t
                    be allowed to) hide the fact that the field is as pressured as any other in the

                    but also in relation to pedagogy and research goals.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">If these insights are grafted onto the turn to "code-craft"
                    signaled at the NEH funded "“Speaking in Code”"
                    workshop in November 2013, the field will have a powerful toolkit at its
                    disposal. Although nascent, this "craft" movement holds great
                    promise as a means of expressing postfoundational methods through a guild or
                    trade-based approach that emphasizes building and experimentation. The stated
                    goal of the workshop can be described as postfoundational in its desire to "give voice to what is almost always tacitly expressed
                            in our work: expert knowledge about the intellectual and interpretive
                            dimensions of DH code-craft, and unspoken understandings about the
                            relation of that work to ethics, scholarly method, and humanities
                            theory" [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2013">Nowviskie et al. 2013</a>]. The initiative is exciting: the goal appears to be to tease out theory
                    and method from a hermeneutic of practice. This aligns very nicely to what this
                    article describes as postfoundational method.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">The problem, as always, is accommodating and being informed by views ranging from
                    a focus on code-craft to the theoretically informed critique of Chun, Balsamo et
                    al. Some efforts must be made, and ideally some intellectual levers must be
                    found, to help bridge the gap. Andrew Prescott notes that digital humanists are
                    well positioned to understand that "knowledge is being
                        turned into a commodity, a data steam disconnected from those who produce it
                        and turned to commercial advantage by monopolistic corporations." In
                    arguing for the necessity of the field, he suggests that "…if humanities scholars wish to ensure that their
                            understanding and engagement with human knowledge does not become
                            another Californian commodity, it is essential to engage with the
                            digital world, and not as consumers but as creators" [<a class="ref" href="#prescott2012">Prescott 2012</a>]. Conversely, it seems logical to argue along with Liu that the opposite
                    is also true: that digital humanists involved in building technologies should be
                    aware of the critiques of the cultural, economic and political domains they
                    might seek to retain intellectual freedom from. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">It’s important to acknowledge, though, that rather than rejecting insights
                    produced through cultural critique, many of the projects referred to in this
                    article are designed as active instantiations of them. Put another way, we could
                    note that there might not be significant cause for concern: postfoundational DH
                    method appears to function surprisingly well against issues presented by
                    postindustrial culture. Not all DH projects are politically motivated — and we
                    could perhaps hope that the bulk of focus remains on traditional topics like
                    scholarly editions, concordances and archives, because this is where the
                    discipline’s main service to the tradition lies — but the more politically
                    motivated projects appear to revel in the knowledge that digital humanists’
                    felicity with the manipulation of the postindustrial system’s "symbolic
                        architecture" (computer code, and the ICT discourses associated
                    with the production and maintenance of not only that, but the system’s broader
                    culture and politics) offers a power that should be mobilized for the common
                    good. Their understanding of the engineered nature of the postindustrial world
                    (their facility with the code that powers its key engines, their ability to
                    build a server rather than be beholden to the dictates of an IT service desk,
                    their ability to do things cost-free) gives them insight into the world of
                        "informational capitalism." The targeted success of the
                    projects is due to the realization that "[i]n the new, informational mode of development the
                            source of productivity lies in the technology of knowledge generation,
                            information processing, and symbolic communication" [<a class="ref" href="#castells2010">Castells 2010</a>, 18, 17]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">This isn’t hack versus yack, it’s hack then act. The projects align extremely
                    well to the goals of more theoretically inclined humanists and evince awareness
                    of the cultural and ideological implications of the technology industry [<a class="ref" href="#dyer-witheford1999">Dyer-Witheford 1999</a>]. Indeed, rather than being anti-theoretical,
                    the projects described above merely suggest a commitment to post (as opposed to
                    anti) foundationalism. They indicate attempts to "use the
                        tools, paradigms, and concepts of digital technologies to help rethink the
                        idea of instrumentality" for the Humanities as a whole [<a class="ref" href="#liu2011b">Liu 2011b</a>, 501]. They aim to use the insights gained from
                    saturation in technical contexts for the greater good of the tradition,
                    politicizing insights gained through postfoundational method and mobilizing them
                    against the aspects of postindustrial capitalism that threaten (and homogenize)
                    the broader arts and humanities community. Historian of technology Rosalind
                    Williams might suggest they have decided that "when culture
                        is no longer an outer shell of context, but is part of the machine"
                    radically new methods of engagement and scholarly production are required [<a class="ref" href="#williams2000">Williams 2000</a>, 661]. Whether production ends with the
                    development of a schema, a data model, a website, a scholarly edition, a journal
                    article or a monograph should matter less than the fact that production has
                    occurred at all.</div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d23602e99"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>I would like to thank Alan Liu for reading an early version of this article, and
