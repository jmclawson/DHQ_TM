                    data, and the development of an advanced search engine, we
                    can apply new methods of historical research. This
                    contributes to a further promotion of the sophisticated use
                    of quantitative data to enhance qualitative historical
                    research. This article focuses on the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span>(Farmers’ Party), the first
                    political party from the far right that entered Dutch
                    parliament after the Second World War (WWII). The <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> is remembered as
                    being stigmatized by the traditional political parties as
                        "wrong" ("<span class="foreign i">fout</span>"), as National Socialism and its
                    supporters were dubbed in the Netherlands. However, no
                    systematic research has been conducted on the questions: in
                    what way, how frequently and for what purpose these
                    connections with the "wrong" past were
                    made. With the available digitized data and the retrieval
                    techniques offered by computer scientists it is now possible
                    to answer these questions. </p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1"> In early January 2012 Jan Baas died. Baas was a member of
                    the Dutch Senate (<span class="foreign i">Eerste
                        Kamer</span>) for the conservative-liberal VVD
                    (People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy) from 1960 to
                    1981, and he gained nationwide repute following a conflict
                    with Hendrik Adams of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span>. The argument became so heated
                    that blows were exchanged. In the Senate Baas had requested
                    the floor for "personal business"
                        (<span class="foreign i">een persoonlijk feit</span>),
                    a special regulation in the Rules of Procedure of the States
                    General. Baas recounted his personal experiences with Adams
                    during the Second World War (WWII). The newly sworn-in
                    senator Adams, said Baas, had been his colleague at a state
                    agricultural college during the war, where he had been known
                    as a supporter of the German occupier. During an argument
                    about Adams’ pro-Nazi conduct, Baas recounted, Adams had
                    even threatened him with deportation. Baas had contemplated
                    at length whether he should stir up these issues, which had
                    occurred more than twenty years earlier: <blockquote><p> Can it be justified to lay bare in public, during
                        their lifetime, the past of persons who were
                            "wrong," politically or
                        otherwise? After much hesitation I have answered this
                        question affirmatively, if these persons seek a position
                        in the social order that, in terms of responsibility and
                        standing, they are, in my opinion, no longer entitled
                        to. <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e172">[1]</a></p></blockquote> This, in short, was more than personal
                    vindictiveness. Baas felt that Adams had not rehabilitated
                    himself sufficiently to be an equal participant in political
                    decision making. <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e177">[2]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2"><span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> leader Hendrik
                    Koekoek has systematically emphasized that the big parties
                    tried to isolate him by referring to the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> as a kind of
                    National Socialist movement that was dominated by former
                    Nazi-collaborators. Exposing Adams in the Senate seemed to
                    confirm this image. But was Koekoek right? Was his party
                    disqualified as "wrong" in Parliament and
                    if so, how was this done? In order to answer these questions
                    we have used a new research method that is possible because
                    the Proceedings of the Dutch States General were digitized
                    some years ago, and the recently concluded project <cite class="title italic">War In Parliament</cite> made systematic
                    and advanced searches possible (see paragraph:
                    methodological innovation). <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e194">[3]</a> What is impossible by hand –
                    finding every fragment in the parliamentary debates that
                    links the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> and
                        "wrong" – does become possible with a
                    digital approach. This article is intended to contribute to
                    the benefits of digital methods to historians by exploring
                    the advantages of using an advanced search engine that can
                    search large quantities of data. However, before we go into
                    the methodology in more detail, we have to introduce the
                        <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> in the
                    historical and political setting of the Netherlands in the
                    1950s and 1960s. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">A Revolution from the Right</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3"> From the rise of Fascism in the 1920s in Italy to the

                    from the liberation up to the present day, Dutch politicians
                    have referred to the dangers of Fascism and Nazism.
                    Referring to Fascism and Nazism is still considered a
                    tried-and-tested method to stigmatize fellow-politicians and
                    it could result in the effective exclusion of parties.

                    the House of Representatives (<span class="foreign i">Tweede
                        Kamer</span>) with three seats in 1963. For the first
                    time since the fleeting electoral gain of the CPN (Communist
                    Party Netherlands) in 1946 the traditional centre parties
                    ARP (Anti-Revolutionary Party), CHU (Christian-Historical
                    Union), KVP (Catholic People’s Party), PvdA (Labour Party)
                    and the conservative-liberal VVD (People’s Party for Freedom
                    and Democracy) had lost a considerable number of seats, this
                    time to a right-wing newcomer to the political stage.
                    Earlier (extreme) right-wing attempts had failed
                    prematurely. Especially when parties were portrayed in the
                    news as assembly points for former Nazi-collaborators their
                    fate was quickly decided. <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e236">[6]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5"> Hendrik Koekoek had, before he entered the political stage
                    as leader of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span>, been a candidate for one of the
                    earlier right wing political attempts (the National
                    Opposition Union, NOU). One of the pacesetters within the
                    NOU was engineer S.D. Rispens, a former member of the
                    National Socialist Movement, founded in 1931 and the only
                    legal party during the war years because of its pro-Nazi
                    attitude. Rispens was convicted after the war and deprived
                    of the right to vote or run for office until 1957. Another
                    candidate was the previously mentioned Hendrik Adams, also
                    an engineer and convicted of collaboration. After the NOU
                    fiasco Rispens and Adams searched for opportunities for a
                    new party, this time with men without a "tainted

                    man like Koekoek was totally compatible with this picture.

                        "intellectually inferior" to Adams

                        Landbouwschap</span>), were threatened with eviction
                    from their farms. The Agricultural board was a statutory
                    industrial organization, established in 1954, a
                    collaboration between the agricultural sector and the
                    government to reform agriculture and horticulture. The
                    resulting taxes and regulations generated resistance,
                    especially among the small farmers. Whereas before these
                    so-called "free farmers" had been
                    punished by imposing fines, the Agricultural board switched
                    to more draconian measures in 1963. The courts sanctioned a
                    decision to remove the three farmers and their families from
                    their farms. This resulted in fierce opposition. Led by
                    Farmers’ Party leader Koekoek hundreds of sympathizers
                    gathered in Hollandscheveld. They were met by police who
                    greeted them with tear gas and truncheons. Television images
                    reached many Dutch households. This did little for the
                    reputation of the Agricultural board and it definitely
                    benefited the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span>.

                    small farmer could count on his support, as became clear
                    during the election campaign, but also others who were
                    dissatisfied with the political establishment and had
                    right-wing sympathies. Koekoek’s political agenda (against
                    state bureaucracy, pro severe punishment of criminals and
                    against foreign "fortune seekers") proved
                    successful not only in the countryside, but also in large
                    cities. Predictions in the summer of 1966 said that in the
                    case of new national elections the party could win as many

                    lot of media attention. Mostly criticism came from the left,

                    academia the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span>
                    became a hot topic. Academics concentrated on the question
                    of whether the ideas of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> were fascist or not. The
                    sociologist A.T.J. Nooij wrote a dissertation based on the
                        "F(ascism) scale" developed
                    by Theodor W. Adorno. Nooij used interviews with supporters
                    of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> and an
                    ingenious computational model to deliver hard scientific
                    evidence of whether the supporters of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> were right-wing
                    extremists and whether they constituted a fascist peril. In
                    the end Nooij did not quite succeed; his problem was finding

                    later, had the same problem. According to him there was no
                    doubt that the supporters of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> leaned towards fascist ideas,
                    but whether the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> could be defined as fascist

                    left, but rather on the right. According to Vossen the
                        <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> should be
                    viewed as one of the parties "in the
                        broader spectrum of right-wing populist parties as it
                        existed in the 1960s and that could, due to societal
                        changes, once again flourish."<a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e370">[15]</a> Vossen’s focus was not so much on the question of
                    how "wrong" the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> was; rather, he pointed out the
                    depth of the impact of the Adams affair on the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span>. Without this
                    affair, Vossen writes, the party might have won the
                    predicted twenty seats in the elections. But: <blockquote><p> In the heated climate of 1966, when the
                        1940-1945 traumas kicked up again, the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> epitomized the
                        presumed continued effect of the fascist mentality,
                        especially for progressive young people. In public
                        meetings of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> the presence of young
                        demonstrators who wanted to nip the fascist danger in
                        the bud was now almost standard. [<a class="ref" href="#vossen2005">Vossen 2005</a>, 246]</p></blockquote> So Vossen attributes the beginning of the decline
                    of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> to
                    extraparliamentary actions. In this article we take a look

                    insight into the degree to which the parliamentary discourse

                    into semi-structured XML documents. In these documents the
                    debates are recorded in a hierarchy of debate subjects
                    (topics), consisting of a series of speakers (scenes), which
                    in turn are made up of speeches (chronological, starting
                    with the main speaker and followed by any interruptions and
                    rebuttals). Every speech consists of paragraphs. This

                    original document, date of session, and chamber (Senate -

                    a challenge, because references to WWII were imprecise and

                    of the time not a "natural" topic in
                    parliamentary debates, due to the fact that WWII is part of
                    the collective memory of Dutch society, thus references to
                    this period could be found in every debate. This is the
                    reason why we experimented with two different Boolean search
                    strategies, instead of using more complex classification
                    methods (i.e. machine learning techniques) which proved to

                    single result set of relevant hits. We cast a wide net, so
                    to speak: all potentially relevant words as they could occur
                    in the spoken text when the subject was "wrong" were
                    combined in the query: <blockquote><p> fascis* OR NSB

                    result sets for the period 1963-1981 (the entire
                    parliamentary term of the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span>). The first result set contained
                    all references to "wrong" by the speakers of the

                    references to "wrong" of all other parties and yielded
                    7662 hits. It should be mentioned that there can be more
                    than one hit in a debate (topic) or even in a speaker

                        ("war" yes, but not the Second World War). Noise

                    for persons who are mentioned. The first is relatively easy.
                    As the structure of parliamentary reports has remained
                    fairly consistent through the years, it was possible -
                    despite the necessary OCR (optical character recognition)
                    errors - to detect the announcement of speakers in nearly
                    every case, and identify the speaker by matching speaker
                    name and party name with a database of politicians with
                    precise session days and party memberships. In this way a
                    distinction can be made between the Christian-Democrat
                    politician Jan de Koning, the liberal H.E. Koning, and J. de

                    mentioned in the spoken text this is not yet possible,
                    because such identification will depend on the context of
                    what is said. A search query on "Koning" will yield
                    many non-relevant results. The search engine is not able to
                    distinguish between the three "Konings" solely on the
                    basis of the text. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20"> Noise is a major obstacle in this study, partly as a result

                    This could be done for example, through more advanced search
                    techniques, such as using statistical language models on the
                    content of the debate text in order to make a classification
                    of speeches that do or do not address a specific topic.
                    Another way of addressing this problem could be clustering
                    speeches based on the relevance of words within a speech
                    with regard to a specific topic, where different algorithms
                    are available to calculate this "relevance." However,
                    this is not off-the-shelf technology and requires more time
                    to implement. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21"> However, even that would not solve the problems. Qualitative

                    the most careful OCR corrections than born digital

                    allegations as vague and insinuating. For Koekoek, however,
                    the issue was that he was made out to be
                        "wrong" and a danger to the state.
                    J.H. Scheps, a World War Two resistance fighter and a
                    heavyweight within the labour party, intervened by pointing
                    out that nobody thought Koekoek was
                        "wrong," but that Koekoek did have to

                        value of parliament. All those individuals who are
                        reputed to stand up for the people at that time proved

                        "wrong" political positions or

                    VVD-senator Baas was given the floor on "personal

                    impossible. This person was Hendrik Adams, whom Baas had met
                    in his position as teacher at a state agricultural college.
                    In class, Baas said, Adams had "systematically propounded his ideas" on the
                    importance of collaborating with the occupier. In 1944 the
                    situation escalated and Adams had threatened Baas with the
                    words: "I, Adams, will make sure you are
                        deported as soon as possible." These words echoed
                    in his mind for many years, Baas said: "More than 20 years later our paths cross again. You
                        will understand, Mr President, that I am not able to be
                        amicable towards Mr Adams"<a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e1029">[24]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35"> The truth was out: Baas could not accept Adams as a

                    mended. According to Baas, Adams had in no way expressed
                    regret for his "wrong" attitude during
                    the war. "If I believed," said
                    Baas, "that Mr Adams understands why he
                        was convicted and lost the right to vote, and that he
                        had come to the realization that he was wrong, then I

                        business" speaking time Adams had been given
                    the opportunity to do this: distance himself from his
                        "wrong" past and show that he had
                    reformed. As he had not, Baas felt the "former political delinquent Adams" lacked "every personal right to be a member of
                        this Senate": <blockquote><p> For other
                        political parties too things would have been different
                        had Adams admitted that he was

                    national socialist collaborator and cowardly traitor, as
                    well as an anti-Semite [during the war he wrote for an
                    anti-Semitic magazine] of the worst kind. In fact, Adams’
                    political death sentence was already signed. On 25 October
                    1966, in the Senate, Adams’ letter of resignation was read:
                        <blockquote><p> The unworthy and above all unlawful

                    political waters, there were very few references to Adams in
                    either the Senate or the House of Representatives. <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e1104">[28]</a> The dividing lines were drawn clearly: former
                    collaborators who did not publicly renounce their war past
                    were not accepted in the highest political bodies. And, as
                    shown by the motion of no-confidence against Koekoek,
                    politicians who did not appreciate this could count on
                    severe disapproval. Did Adams’ retreat also mean the end of
                    the connection that was made between the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> and "wrong?"
                    It’s time to draw some conclusions. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41"> First of all, up to the Adams affair in the autumn of 1966
                    the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> was not
                    associated in Parliament with a fascist ideology, but was
                        "merely" accused of a
                        "wrong" mentality; the conduct of
                    Koekoek and associates allegedly showed the non-acceptance
                    of parliamentary mores and rules, which was reminiscent of
                    the undemocratic conduct of the NSB in the 1930s. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42"> Secondly, the Adams affair meant a rift in the political
                    discourse about the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij.</span> An alleged
                        "wrong" mentality was no longer the
                    issue. The affair demonstrated a totally different aspect of
                    the link between "wrong" and <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij:</span> the discussions about Adams
                    showed the unwritten conditions that former collaborators
                    had to meet in order to be allowed back into political
                    decision making. Adams was unable to stand his ground
                    because he would not renounce his past. In fact, he made it
                    clear he did not regard his war past as
                        "wrong." The fact that Koekoek stood
                    by him and attempted to expose politicians in other parties
                    as "wrong," almost resulted in political
                    suicide. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43"> The third conclusion is that after 1966 hardly any links
                    were made in Parliament between the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> and "wrong." This begs the
                    question whether the rejection of Adams also served another
                    purpose, namely to render the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> harmless. Disqualifying
                    political opponents with a reference to the Second World War
                    was (and is) an effective means to do so. Based on our
                    findings we may state that the association with a
                        "wrong" mentality by itself had
                    little political effect. The <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> continued to grow in the period
                    between 1963-1966. However, when a concrete person was
                    convincingly exposed as "wrong" and the
                    party did not unambiguously distance itself from this
                    individual, electoral success evaporated. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44"> As the first two conclusions are the result of
                    interpretation of the gained results (close reading), the
                    third – no links between the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> and "wrong" –
                    couldn’t have been drawn without a digital approach, and is
                    promising for further historical research. More research
                    would benefit our understanding of political transition
                    periods and the relationship between electoral success of
                    newcomers to the political scene and the attempts of the
                        "old" parties to disqualify their
                    intentions. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head"> Lessons Learned </h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45"> Unfortunately, digitized sources are generally used in much
                    the same way as the originals. The advantage of digitization
                    is then limited to easy access (no more trips to the
                    university library) and to finding what you are looking for
                    (a particular debate or speaker) more quickly. The
                    state-of-the-art search engine that was developed in the War
                    in Parliament project enabled the combination of several
                    search queries in order to systematically check if, and if
                    so, in what way the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span> was linked to "wrong" in
                    the parliamentary debate. In other words, in this project we
                    did more than just speed up our research by formalizing our
                    research question. During this process the "War in Parliament" pilot project
                    has taught us some valuable lessons. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46"> The first lesson concerns the nature of the information that
                    one looks for in the context of studying references to WWII
                    in general, and in this particular case the relationship
                    between the <span class="foreign i">Boerenpartij</span>
                    and "wrong." With the exception of debates that
                    explicitly concern WWII (debates about the release of war
                    criminals, pensions for war victims etc.). WWII tends to be
                    a very <em class="emph">implicit</em> topic in the parliamentary
                    debates. References are often made in passing and some are
                    very hard to capture. This is one of the reasons why
                    machine-learning techniques with which we experimented (see
                    above) failed. The second lesson was that the relevant
                    phrases are time-specific (Holocaust, political delinquents)
                    and semantically ambiguous. To give just one example of
                    semantic ambiguity: "<span class="foreign i">bezetting</span>" (occupation) in the sense
                    of the German occupation of the Netherlands between 1940 and
                    1945 also harvested references to the occupation of
                    departments, hospital beds etc. So, the need for close
                    reading remains a prerequisite to gaining the relevant
                    results. <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e1209">[29]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47"> The big challenge is therefore how to improve retrieval
                    performance. In a proposal we submitted to the Netherlands
                    Organization for Scientific Research this year, and in which
                    the digital approach is crucial to harvesting our results,
                    we build explicitly on the experiences gained in War in
                    Parliament. <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e1220">[30]</a> In this proposal, and in
                    addition to the current state-of-the-art Boolean query
                    suggestions, we plan to add three key extensions aimed at
                    improving the suggestions and thereby the retrieval system’s
                    effectiveness. One way is to include synonym structure,
                    either user-contributed, corpus-generated or extracted from
                    a dictionary or back-of-the-book-indexes (e.g. knowledge
                    based enrichment). The second addition is semantic in
                    nature; from experiments involving media studies
                    researchers, we know that semantically informed search
                    suggestions (based e.g., on people, organizations and
                    locations) are key to exploratory searches in digital
                    humanities. We aim to integrate such suggestions within the
                    proposed Boolean query suggestion environment. <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e1225">[31]</a> We will visualize such semantic suggestions in term
                    clouds to analyze them. Finally, the third addition, is to
                    make Boolean query suggestions time-aware. <a class="noteRef" href="#d30652e1228">[32]</a> References to WWII were, as reported above, not only
                    implicit in many cases, they were also subject to trends
                    (changes in vocabulary). Terms that make good query
                    suggestions during one period may not be very effective
                    during another. The insights gained in time-awareness will
                    be integrated into the query suggestion process through a
                    combination of time series analysis (of term frequencies)
                    and co-occurrence analysis. With these improvements, we hope
                    we’ve found a solution for the main problems experienced in
                    the War in Parliament project. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48"> This is the more important, because WWII has been the most
                    powerful benchmark of political morality in post-war Western
                    societies, and political elites were (and still are) in
                    permanent need to relate to the defining experiences of
                    warfare, political oppression and genocide. An
                    interdisciplinary approach will provide us with models for a
                    better understanding of that past. Extensive usage and
                    further development of existing text-mining tools will
                    enable us to address questions about political transition
                    periods (in this article a new right-wing party entering the
                    political stage) and whether or not there is a relationship
                    between the utilization of WWII as a political argument and
                    these transitions. A digital approach, as we have seen,

                    digital historical research. This is all the more important
                    because it is a much neglected subject, not only in the
                    scholarly literature but also by technical utopianists who
                    push for a revolution in the humanities. The Dutch Academy

                    tools. In this journal, the Swedish scholar Patrick
                    Svensson, who can hardly be accused of scepticism towards
                    digital innovations, wrote in 2012: "‘While the ideas of grand challenges and big humanities

                        the frame of big humanities, which, for instance, has a
                        tendency to be coupled with a positivist agenda and a

                    which means here the desire to emphasize on quantitative
                    criteria in the humanities and thus to squeeze out the
                    qualitative (and therefore less measurable) ones, we need to
                    realize that digital source material is a prerequisite to
                    apply text-mining techniques. This may sound like we are
                    stating the obvious, but we are not; in practice much of the
                    material is still in analogue form, and can therefore not be
                    searched using text-mining techniques. At NIOD, for example,
                    less than three percent of the total archival material has
                    been digitized. If the large-scale version of the
                    methodological innovation is to be successful, mass
                    digitization of paper collections is inevitable. This step
                    is in danger of being skipped because there is so much focus
                    on the more "sexy" development of tools. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51"> Furthermore, much archival material is in formats that
                    either cannot be transcribed at all as text [e.g. graphical
                    material] or which has only been digitized as a page image
                    but has not been transcribed as text [e.g. page images of
                    manuscript materials or documents that for various reasons
                    cannot be processed with OCR]. This means that digitization
                    of this material can help us retrieve certain information
                    more easily, but it will remain necessary to analyse results
                    by hand at a rather low level. But given these challenges,
                    the success of methodological innovation first and foremost
                    depends on digitization of paper collection for which there
                    is often no money or no will (or both). However, if this
                    isn’t done, only a small number of historians will get
                    involved in the much needed discussions on the improvement
                    of digital techniques to conduct historical research. </div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d30652e172"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span><a class="ref" href="http://wip.politicalmashup.nl/resolver/nl.proc.sgd.d.196619670000002?view=                                    html&amp;amp;q=Adams#nl.proc.sgd.d.196619670000002.1.7.3." onclick="window.open('http://wip.politicalmashup.nl/resolver/nl.proc.sgd.d.196619670000002?view=                                    html&amp;amp;q=Adams#nl.proc.sgd.d.196619670000002.1.7.3.'); return false">http://wip.politicalmashup.nl/
