                    end them. We imagine that all projects are dynamic and
                    ongoing — taking on a life of their own. Rarely do we admit
                    that some are moribund, or should be gracefully wound down.
                    We don’t want to think about their ends so we don’t plan
                    endings, and thus many projects are not properly documented
                    and deposited. This is a shame, especially in a field that
                    has thought so long and hard about preservation through the

                    technologies through the 1990’s meant that much of the
                    attention of librarians, archivists, and researchers was
                    dedicated to establishing best practices for preserving
                    newly digitized cultural heritage materials. While
                    born-digital research projects were developing in parallel
                    to these large-scale digitizations, the work of establishing
                    best practices for concluding and archiving those research
                    projects necessarily involved both an extension of, and a
                    significant departure from, the practice of digitization. As
                    Margaret Hedstrom noted in 1998, "the
                        critical role of digital libraries and archives in
                        ensuring the future accessibility of information with
                        enduring value has taken a back seat to enhancing access
                        to current and actively used materials"[<a class="ref" href="#hedstrom1998">Hedstrom 1998</a>]. Still, Hedstrom is able to
                    articulate two key departures for digital preservation: that
                    preserving media alone cannot preserve "information with enduring value" and that
                    technologies for mass storage do not translate into
                    technologies for long-term preservation. Print-based
                    projects found their conclusion in the physical medium
                        ("book", "article"
                    etc.), and libraries and archives preserved those objects by
                    means of acid-free paper, climate control, etc. The
                    technology for mass storage <em class="emph">did</em> constitute a
                    technology for long-term preservation. Born-digital
                    research, on the other hand, has yet to comprehensively
                    establish the conventions that will be capable of dealing
                    with the now separate requirements of doneness and archival
                    object — form <em class="emph">and</em> content. Each new project
                    reveals nuances and complexities that we must address as we
                    develop new best practices. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">In the last few years, there have been a growing number of
                    organizations that have been making advancements in digital
                    preservation methods. This includes the Reference Model for
                    an Open Archival Information System (OAIS), CEDARS (CURL,
                    Consortium of University Research Libraries, Exemplars in
                    Digital Archives-UK), National Library of Australia (NLA),
                    and RLG/OCLC (Research Library Group). Indeed, librarians,
                    archivists and other information professionals have a vital
                    role to play in developing and maintaining such methods and
                    standards, and in providing the stable end-point for
                    deposit. As Kretzschmar and Potter persuasively argue,
                        "collaboration with the university
                        library is the only realistic option for
                        long-term sustainability of digital humanities projects
                        in the current environment"[<a class="ref" href="#kretzschmar2010">Kretzschmar and Potter 2010</a>]. Given the exigencies of
                    project funding, project leadership, and ever-shifting
                    technological developments and demands, the stability of the
                    institutional archive is vital. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Being aware of such efforts and debates, however, and
                    successfully depositing a digital project, are not always
                    the same thing. The Compendium did many things right, and in
                    fact was forward-thinking in its approach to its own ending.
                    Still, even with improved standards, thoughtful guidance,
                    and more rigorous practices, important lessons were learned
                    through the process. These will provide valuable guidance to
                    future DH projects, and provide a significant supplement to
                    the existing literature.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Project Background</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The Globalization and Autonomy Online Compendium was one of
                    two major coordinated outcomes of the Globalization and
                    Autonomy project. The other major deliverable was a
                    ten-volume academic book series published by UBC Press.
                        <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e215">[2]</a> The project was supported by a Major Collaborative
                    Research Initiative (MCRI) grant of $CAD 2.5 million from
                    the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)
                    of Canada, awarded in 2002. The project was
                        "concluded" (insofar as the funding
                    was concerned) in 2007. And yet, as papers in a special
                    cluster of DHQ titled <cite class="title italic">Done</cite>
                    discuss: Is a project ever truly done? <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e226">[3]</a> Certainly the publication of all the print volumes
                    took longer.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">The Globalization and Autonomy project was led by William
                    Coleman at McMaster University, and involved over forty
                    co-investigators in twelve universities across Canada and
                    another twenty academic contributors around the world, not
                    to mention funded graduate students and staff. Geoffrey
                    Rockwell was a co-investigator with the responsibility for
                    the design and management of the Compendium; Nancy Johnson
                    was the editor of the Compendium; and both Shawn Day and
                    Joyce Yu were research assistants hired to help manage the
                    deposit process. Unlike some projects, the digital
                    deliverable was woven in from the beginning — it was written
                    into the grant, budgeted, assessed at the mid-term review
                    and peer reviewed by the UBC Press. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e234">[4]</a> As part of weaving in a digital component, the team
                    also planned for a wrapping up when the Compendium would be
                    archived and deposited, even if it was also maintained
                    online. While we planned for an end, what we failed to
                    estimate properly was how difficult it is to wrap up a
                    project. This forms one of the crucial learning outcomes of
                    the digital side of this project and probably serves as a
                    benchmark reminder of the crucial importance of budgeting
                    and planning for the "end" of a project.
                    In fact, as in so many cases, an end that allows for a
                    sustainable continuity to the research is one of the most

                    participants and submitted as Microsoft Word files for
                    editing. A decision was taken early not to try to force
                    contributors to learn our XML application. The editor and
                    assistants translated and encoded the content using a Text
                    Encoding Initiative (TEI) application for contemporary
                    research developed with consultants including Julia Flanders
                    and Syd Bauman. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e298">[6]</a>
                    During the encoding process, the editor inserted links from
                    articles to glossary entries. This was done using a search
                    and replace batch tool we built that allowed us to update

                    we developed following the TEI guidelines — we followed best
                    practices including involving outside consultants at regular
                    intervals to advise and later review the system. The same
                    applied to the technical structure and the interface design.
                    For the interface design we followed a persona/scenario
                    design process [<a class="ref" href="#cooper2004">Cooper 2004</a>] that involved
                    project stakeholders outside the development team. Interface
                    personas and usage scenarios were presented to the full team
                    at one of the annual conferences as were successive
                    iterations of the Compendium. This was important to get
                    feedback and buy-in from the larger team, many of whom were
                    focused on their own research and the volumes planned for
                    the UBC Press series. We also had to negotiate what would go
                    in the volumes and what would go in the Compendium. In the
                    end we included summaries of all relevant chapters from the
                    print volumes in the digital Compendium — a compromise with
                    the UBC Press that had the advantage of allowing the editor
                    to rewrite summaries for the Compendium in language more
                    accessible than the volumes and more suitable for the web.
                    Because our anticipated audience included students and
                    policy workers, we strove to make the online Compendium
                    accessible to non-academics interested in Globalization and
                    a thorough Glossary was an important addition to that end. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">To manage the Compendium as it was being edited, we developed
                    an administrative interface with tools so that the editor
                    could manage the TEI files. The administrative interface
                    would parse, verify, and process files when uploaded. Upon
                    uploading for the databases, metadata that dynamically
                    generated tables of content would be extracted; the files
                    were also indexed for searching. This administrative
                    interface is hidden and less polished. One of the questions
                    we had to ask ourselves was what should happen to this part
                    of the system at the end. Should it too be documented and
                    archived? More generally, we had to ask what was ending and
                    what had to be documented. A project of this size has all
                    sorts of ephemera from email discussion archives to
                    conference materials. Even before the actual
                        "content" was being produced,
                    important questions of what ought to be documented and
                    preserved arose.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">The bibliographic records followed a different administrative
                    process and were entered directly through a separate web
                    interface to the database. At an early stage in production
                    we encountered an interesting problem: how to synchronize a
                    single bibliographic database for the project with all the
                    bibliographies from the individual position papers,
                    articles, and glossary entries as they trickled in. As
                    documents came in, we found that different writers would
                    enter slightly different information for the same reference.
                    We wanted a way to normalize the bibliographies without
                    having to wait until the end. What we settled on may seem
                    somewhat complicated but it made sense in the context of the
                    wider ongoing project and was what the larger team wanted
                    when we presented the problem to them. </div><div class="ptext"><ol class="list"><li class="item">First, the editor did not encode the bibliography of

                        the database entry as needed.</li><li class="item">Once an entry was checked/added/updated in the
                        database, she generated a stub tag with a key that
                        corresponded to the database record. This, rather than
                        the full record was put into the XML file for the
                        article. Then the article could be uploaded to the
                        Compendium.</li><li class="item">When the XML version of the article was uploaded, the

                        Thus, should articles become detached from the
                        bibliographic database (as happens when one deposits the
                        materials), each article will include a full
                        bibliography marked up in XML. The project team in one
                        of our meetings on the Compendium felt this was
                        important; they didn’t want their writings dependent on
                        dynamic generation from other data for
                        completeness.</li><li class="item">In the uploading we also kept online all the XML files

                        replace the full XML files, thereby eliminating any
                        inconsistencies that might occur as we correct entries
                        over time. In short, we could regenerate the content on
                        a regular basis to guarantee consistency. </li></ol></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">As for the components of the Compendium, it is technically

                    problem of depositing the Compendium as a whole. The true,
                    though simple, story we tell ourselves in the digital
                    humanities is that ensuring that a project uses an
                    appropriate form of markup (like the TEI) for content is
                    sufficient to preserve the work. The experience of the
                    Compendium is that the intellectual work is not only in the
                    individual articles, or even in the bibliographic data – it
                    is in the interaction between these, mediated by code and in
                    the user experience. The Glossary is a prime example — the
                    meaning is not just in the text of entries, but also in the
                    searchable whole and web of articles linked to glossary
                    entries. Likewise the interface design reflects decisions
                    about the audience that is unquestionably important to
                    understanding the work as a whole. These difficulties
                    clearly instantiate the difference between what Paul Conway
                    has named "digital preservation" and "digitization
                        for preservation". While they are "intimately related… the underlying
                        standards, processes, technologies, costs, and
                        organizational challenges are quite distinct"[<a class="ref" href="#conway2010">Conway 2010</a>, 63]. We initially
                    thought it would be trivial to deposit the Compendium – in
                    the grant proposal we promised that we would encode the
                    content following the TEI guidelines and then deposit it at
                    the Oxford Text Archives and other similar digital archives
                    (digitization for preservation), but of course, the XML is
                    not the Compendium. The Compendium is a work of its own that
                    is more than the sum of the XML files. How do we deposit
                    such a system (digital preservation)? What exactly are the
                    boundaries in time and scope of the work that mark what
                    should be deposited? Ultimately we realize that the choices
                    we make in constructing the deposit reflect a major intent
                    of undertaking the project itself and that the ability to
                    capture user experience must increasingly inform digital
                    project planning.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">What is Done?</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">As Matthew Kirchenbaum writes in the introductory essay to a

                        "projection". Thus projects morph
                    into projections with futures for knowledge. As Brown et al.
                    put it, "This interplay between
                        traditional humanities content and innovative
                        methodologies means there is always more to be
                        done"[<a class="ref" href="#brown2009">Brown et al 2009</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">So what did we consider “done” in the Globalization and
                    Autonomy project? When and how did we plan to end the
                    Compendium? First of all, as a grant-funded project,
                    Globalization and Autonomy had a natural deadline as the
                    funding was supposed to be spent by 2007. SSHRC does allow
                    projects to apply for extensions if the funds are not spent
                    and there were some funds secured from other sources that
                    were independent of the grant, but effectively the plan was
                    to finish the Compendium and deposit something by 2008 when
                    the funding for researchers, research assistants, editors
                    and programmers would wind down. We had anticipated that
                    more work would be involved to deposit the project and had
                    allocated funds to do so. What we underestimated was how
                    long it would take to deposit the project. We finally
                    deposited the materials in 2012 — four years following the
                    official "conclusion" of the project. In
                    retrospect, it was unreasonable to expect the project to be
                    wrapped up and deposited during the last year of the
                    project. It would be akin to archiving a book while the
                    author is still writing the conclusion. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">This raises a question of whether the model of grant-project
                    funding needs to be rethought. Ideally, projects would
                    properly account for the time needed to wind down and bury
                    their dead data, but we believe that is unreasonable, at
                    least in 3- to 5-year projects, which is the typical funded
                    length in Canada. Given the rhythm of the academic calendar,
                    the time it takes to get a project going and then to develop
                    digital research sites makes it hard to do a good job that
                    tidies everything up. Any interesting project will change as
                    it continues to do research that further challenges tidy
                    timelines. Better would be small grant programs that provide
                    funding for finished projects that secure trusted
                    preservation partners to wind their project down, document
                    the project, and deposit appropriate data. Previously funded
                    projects, for which granting agencies have some
                    responsibility, would then be encouraged to be open about
                    what they had and how they could make sure the research data
                    was available over the long term. Such a grant program would
                    also draw attention to data preservation and foster research
                    into preservation. But, for many this is simply the least
                    glamourous aspect of the project process and therefore
                    hardest to find internal motivation to accomplish.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">As for what would be done in the ending of our project, it
                    made sense to us to deposit the project as it was at the end
                    of the grant. The state of the Compendium at that point
                    represented a natural moment to deposit the materials. In
                    fact, because it took us longer than expected to work out
                    where and how to deposit the project, we were able to
                    include materials from related conferences. These additional
                    materials were added to the Compendium in 2009 as we were
                    still working things out. Nonetheless, the goal was to
                    deposit the Compendium as of the end of the grant in 2007
                    and into 2008.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">As with many digital projects, we did not conceive of the
                    version finished in 2008 as necessarily the end of any work

                    development of a useful resource and the project leader had
                    ideas for future phases of the Compendium, but we felt we
                    should nonetheless assume that the Compendium might never be
                    funded again and deposit its state at the end of the
                    grant.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">It should be noted that a number of things have been done to
                    the Compendium since 2007. William Coleman ran a conference
                    in 2007 titled <cite class="title italic">Building South-North
                        Dialogue on Globatlization Research</cite> that brought
                    together researchers from the Global South and Global North,
                    and then a follow up meeting in August of 2008. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e408">[8]</a> Selected papers from the conferences were
                    reviewed, edited, and added to the Compendium. More
                    importantly, the conferences looked at the idea of
                    developing the Compendium into a portal for research into
                    globalization that would enhance South-North dialogue. The
                    consensus was, however, that there wasn’t sufficient need or
                    support for such a portal. Another change to the Compendium
                    happened as a result of Coleman leaving McMaster University
                    for the University of Waterloo bringing the Compendium with
                    him. The Compendium was redeployed to a server at the
                    University of Waterloo and a news feed from Coleman’s blog
                    was added to create a new entry page that could stay
                    current. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e413">[9]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">A third consideration as to what should be done at the end of
                    the project was that the funder (SSHRC) requires all
                    projects to deposit their research data. To quote from the
                    SSHRC Research Data Archiving Policy, "All research data collected with the use of SSHRC funds
                        must be preserved and made available for use by others

                    SSHRC conducted as part of the National Research Data
                    Archive Consultation revealed that very few datasets could
                    actually be found:</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">In any given year, as many as one-half

                        55 per cent. This extrapolates to approximately 1200

                        1998 and 2000, or an average of 400 each year. As of
                        January 2001, only 7 per cent of those researchers
                        surveyed had archived their data, and only a further 18
                        per cent reported that they intended to do so. Of the 18
                        per cent that intend to archive their data, less than
                        one half were able to identify an actual data archiving

                    products be effectively archived, let alone provide the
                    mechanisms to do so. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e443">[11]</a> The uncomfortable truth of
                    project ends is that we don’t properly bury our projects,
                    even though we know this is what we should do and often talk
                    about using guidelines like the TEI. And that is what
                    scholarly encoding following best practice guidelines like
                    the TEI is about — encoding one’s data so that others can
                    understand the decisions and be able to reuse it long after
                    the original researcher is gone. Projects should be designed
                    from the beginning to die gracefully, leaving as a legacy
                    the research data developed in a form usable in the future.
                    An archived project must not be expected to be a live one,
                    and yet, as Paul Conway argues, our expectations of the
                    digital information environment require that our access to
                    materials remain (apparently) unmediated (Conway 63). We are
                    fooling ourselves if we think projects will survive over
                    time as living, well-maintained projects. Ask yourself how
                    many projects you have let lapse without a service.
                    Likewise, we are fooling ourselves if we think we can always
                    do the burial next year when we think we have more time.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">But, why bother? SSHRC succinctly defines some of the reasons

                    academic standards of openness by providing opportunities to
                    further analyze, replicate, verify and refine research
                    findings. Such opportunities enhance progress within fields
                    of research as well as support the expansion of
                    inter-disciplinary research. In addition, greater
                    availability of research data will contribute to improved
                    training for graduate and undergraduate students, and,
                    through the secondary analysis of existing data, make
                    possible significant economies of scale. Finally,
                    researchers whose work is publicly funded have a special
                    obligation to openness and accountability. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e454">[12]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">They don’t say it explicitly, but another reason to deposit

                    the mill of future researchers who may want to study us. Our
                    artifacts carry, despite our best intentions, hermeneutical
                    baggage. That which we bury may be of interest to the
                    archaeologists of knowledge of the future. SSHRC expects us
                    to be open so that others can study the research process
                    once we are dead, buried and history — a rather alarming
                    prospect, but one of the features of an emerging philosophy
                    of open research that advocates for exposing the research
                    process rather than hiding the mess behind authoritative

                    were the components in a seemingly straightforward technical
                    construct that we considered essential to deposit and how
                    could we package these in a means that would allow for their
                    potential disinterment? Just a important to this process was
                    the consideration of where to deposit that would allow for
                    both preservation and access to the constituent parts.

                    research articles and other documents (bibliographic
                    database, HTML pages) created and published in the
                    Compendium. This, of course, raises the question of exactly
                    what is content. Is there not content to an interface
                    independent of the text? Those questions are for another
                    paper; in our case we considered content to be the texts,
                    including bibliography, and glossary. We also considered the
                    text on the HTML pages content.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38"><span class="hi bold">Code:</span> Although the underlying code that
                    we have described may seem obvious, this is where things
                    begin to become difficult to cleanly identify. While one can
                    easily deposit code, it is difficult to imagine code being
                    useful for people or usable for archaeologists who might
                    want to reconstruct the Compendium. So we may ask, why
                    deposit code? Our reason was that in the code lies the
                    interactivity and interface — for us code includes the XSLT
                    code that generated much of the interface. We decided that
                    one of our objectives was to deposit materials that would
                    allow for the reconstitution of the Compendium in its
                    interactive form whether through the interpretation of code
                    or, less likely, through the reconstitution of a working
                    system.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39"><span class="hi bold">Process:</span> Related to code is process. We
                    wanted to not just deposit the components that resided on
                    the server (XML files, database files, and code), but also
                    to deposit information that would trace the processes of the
                    Compendium as a collaborative project. The Compendium is the
                    result of various research, programming, and editorial
                    processes and decisions — many of which are documented in
                    instructions to authors and coders and other administrative
                    documents, including documentation around the deposit
                    process itself stored in the wiki. The process whereby we
                    handle synchronizing bibliographic entries mentioned above
                    is a case in point — it made a difference to the content that
                    isn’t apparent in the final XML files which hide the process
                    whereby bibliographies were generated. Therefore we decided
                    to deposit certain materials (but not all) that document the
                    editorial processes, including the editorial backend that
                    strictly speaking was not part of the Compendium as
                    experienced.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40"><span class="hi bold">The User Experience:</span> Lastly we wanted
                    to deposit information that allows people to get a sense of
                    what the user experience of the compendium might be without
                    having to reconstitute a working copy. We made a concerted
                    attempt to deposit information about the experience of the
                    Compendium as an interactive work by writing a narrative
                    along with screen shots of typical use of the Compendium
                    stored as PDFs. This has the added advantage that it could
                    help someone wanting to re-implement some part of the
                    interactive code.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">It is also worth noting what we did not prepare for deposit.
                    We did not prepare for deposit materials from the project
                    that went into the UBC Press volumes because their printing
                    preserves that research in its final state. To gather those
                    materials would also have been a time consuming project as
                    we would have had to contact all the authors, negotiate
                    rights, and negotiate with UBC Press. Nor did we prepare for
                    deposit materials from the running of the Globalization and
                    Autonomy project itself; the only process documents chosen
                    were those associated with the editorial process for the
                    Compendium and materials concerning the decision-making
                    around the depositing process itself. (We added, at the last
                    moment, copies of the wiki where we documented our deposit
                    project.) Again, depositing all process documents was beyond
                    what we could do and it would have taken considerable work
                    to gather, negotiate rights for, and document all the
                    discussions. Finally, we did not gather draft documents for
                    the Compendium itself, such as the first drafts of papers
                    before editing and encoding. We focused instead on
                    depositing the Compendium — the finished online publication
                    and the experience of it. As useful as other materials might
                    be, we believe the most important materials to deposit
                    should be those that were carefully prepared for publication
                    and public viewing. These represent what the team
                    collectively wanted to pass on to the larger community as
                    useful research. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">As for how to organize the deposit, we decided to create a
                    deposit collection with these four components (content,
                    code, process, and experience) separated, each in the best
                    preservation formats we could find. This was easy for the
                    content; it was designed from the start in XML, which is, to
                    a certain extent, self-documenting. But in the case of code
                    it is less clear. For the code, all the materials were
                    output to a flat-file format, so things like the
                    bibliographic database were output to XML. The code was then
                    minimally commented so that it could be compiled, and
                    documentation was generated in HTML or XML in an industry
                    standard fashion where possible, though we note these
                    standards are for documentation, not preservation. The point
                    is that the documentation is embedded in the code and could
                    be extracted to produce documentation assuming that future
                    computer scientists recognize how to extract documentation. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">We also created "Read Me" documents
                    describing the environment and the technical arrangements
                    needed to run the code. We realize this means we did not
                    deposit a working system that someone could download,
                    install, and run to recreate the Compendium. The databases
                    were not stored in their native format; they will have to be
                    regenerated and we didn’t create a tarball (tape archive
                    file) of the whole site that could be unarchived into a
                    directory on a suitable machine to provide a working
                    instance. Frankly, we doubt anyone would bother and we doubt
                    server configurations will stay stable enough for unarchived
                    tarballs to work years from now. Instead, we sought to
                    deposit something that could be explored as is AND used to
                    recreate aspects of the current Compendium in the more
                    distant future if that matters to information
                    archaeologists. Preservation is, after all, the protection
                    of "information for <em class="emph">access</em>
                        by present and future generation" (Conway, cited
                    in [<a class="ref" href="#hedstrom1998">Hedstrom 1998</a>], our emphasis). Access is not
                    recreation, and over the long term the chances that someone
                    can recreate the hardware and software platform on which an
                    installation could work will approach zero. We are better
                    off giving them something they can understand and
                    re-implement, if needed, than something they can’t install.
                    Further, the purpose of depositing is not only so that
                    people can recreate the original site, but also so that they
                    can study the Compendium and reuse it in unanticipated
                    ways.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Similarly, we were not trying to deposit something in a form
                    where the interactivity could be maintained. There are
                    models for preserving interactive objects so that they can
                    be easily run on emulators. The most obvious would be to
                    move all the interactivity into XSL or other XML standards
                    for interactive processing like SMIL. The reasons we did not
                    go that route are that it is too expensive, it probably
                    won’t capture all of the interactivity, and we do not hold
                    much confidence in any of the candidate standards for
                    interactivity. Think about what happened to HyTime as a
                    standard (if you have even heard of it). <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e508">[14]</a>
                    Instead, we created a deposit package with screen shots of
                    the experience of using the Compendium so that someone who
                    also had the code and content could at the very least
                    understand the experience and, if they chose to re-implement
                    things, could recreate it. There is nothing glitzy or flashy
                    about this, and that is the point. We are trying to recreate
                    the experience in as basic a form as possible to allow for
                    appreciation of the experience using as simple tools as
                    possible, for as long as possible. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">Lastly, we should mention that we prepared the package for
                    deposit in an Institutional Repository, but we also prepared
                    other ways of archiving the Compendium. We printed selected
                    parts of it on acid-fee paper so there would be a paper
                    archival copy and we burned the package to CD-ROM and
                    distributed the CD-ROMs to participants so that the CDs
                    might survive. Now we will turn to the deposit itself.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Question of Where to Deposit</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">Once the issue of <em class="emph">what</em> to deposit had been
                    settled, the question became where to deposit the
                    Compendium. We decided that multiple depositories were the
                    most prudent solution, and one that presented the best
                    possibilities for long-term preservation and future access.
                    The question then was where to find Institutional
                    Repositories (IR) willing to take the materials. Library and
                    Archives Canada <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e525">[15]</a>
                    is the official depository for published material in Canada,
                    but they were not equipped to take digital materials. When
                    it comes to funded research from institutions of higher
                    education, a number of university libraries have been
                    certified to receive research materials. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e531">[16]</a> At the time, the project host institution, McMaster
                    University, did not have an institutional repository, which
                    meant we didn't have a local IR. Another option was to find
                    an international IR. Unfortunately those we contacted were
                    not able to help us at the time due to funding constraints.
                    (Alas, it seems that some IRs have had their funding cut to
                    the point of being barely able to operate, which does not
                    bode well for preservation and is another reason for
                    depositing to multiple IRs.)</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">The situation in 2008 thus seemed hopeless. We had done all
                    this work to prepare a package and now we couldn’t find
                    anyone to take it. Fortunately time heals IRs, and since
                    then both McMaster University and the University of Alberta
                    have set up IRs able to take our data. With the help of the
                    Digital Preservation Librarian Nick Ruest we deposited the
                    package at DigitalCommons@McMaster. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e539">[17]</a> We have also deposited it to the Education and
                    Research Archive (ERA) of the University of Alberta. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e545">[18]</a> As a side note, although Library and Archives Canada
                    did have it in their brief to accept the package and were in
                    fact anxious to learn by doing so, revisions to the Library
                    and Archives Canada Act (2004) in 2007 removed <cite class="title italic">Databases or web-based
                        applications</cite> from their brief. <a class="noteRef" href="#d830e554">[19]</a> Seemingly they have backed away from the challenge
                    despite the increasing use of such means to make research
                    material available for reuse.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">This brings us back to ends. There are ends to the Compendium
                    other than its deposit. One end that is not in the scope of
                    this paper, but may interest readers, is managing the review
                    of the Compendium so that those of us who worked on the
                    digital design but are not published in the book series are
                    recognized. When the project negotiated with publishers, one
                    reason we selected UBC Press was that they agreed to conduct
                    a peer-review of the Compendium along with the print series.
                    We often talk about how digital work isn’t reviewed, which
                    causes trouble in the academy, but in this case the
                    Compendium was reviewed and, in effect, accepted for
                    publication as a companion to the print series. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">A more important end, of course, is an anticipated beginning.
                    We may be burying the Compendium, but we do so partly in
                    order to bring it back to life in a new form. William
                    Coleman has been negotiating with other organizations to
                    develop the Compendium into an ongoing peer-review venue
                    that would, like a journal, continue to accept and review
                    new materials. But unlike a journal, these would be
                    organized encyclopedically rather than chronologically in
                    issues. With the addition of community tools like forums and
                    comment features that are not peer-reviewed, we hope the
                    Compendium could evolve into a venue for research and
                    learning around Globalization, especially from the Global
                    South — voices that are too infrequently heard in our circles.
                    The quality, extent and even distribution of content we now
                    have are, we believe, assets on which we can build
                    relationships. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">Finally, an end is what one learns. Some of the key lessons
                    we learned from this project are:</div><div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Researchers and other research stakeholders need to
                        take research data deposit seriously and allocate it the
                        necessary time and resources.</li><li class="item">Researchers should decide when something is done and
                        what that means <em class="emph">early</em> in a project, not in
                        the rush of a messy end. At the same time, researchers
                        should be willing to redefine the when and what as the
                        project evolves. </li><li class="item">The decision of <em class="emph">what</em> to do when a project
                        (or phase) is done is not simple. At the very least the
                        content published online should be deposited in such a
                        way that it can be discovered and reused.</li><li class="item">Researchers should seek <em class="emph">advice</em> from local
                        librarians about the deposit services available and
                        current best practices.</li><li class="item">It is better to deposit something at some point than
                        to perpetually put it off. Beware of developing the
                        wrapping up process into such an ambitious project that
                        it is never finished. Finishing a project should not
                        become a new project.</li><li class="item">Researchers should consider depositing information
                        about the deposit decisions themselves. That sort of
                        metadata can help future users understand what was
                        deposited and why.</li><li class="item">It takes significant time and effort to deposit a
                        project. It is not a matter of spending a weekend
                        uploading the XML at hand to a repository.</li><li class="item">That which you decide to finish and deposit will
                        change as you deposit it. Be prepared for a long deposit
                        process that will have to deal with a moving
                        target.</li><li class="item">For grant-funded projects, you should in principle
                        budget and plan a first deposit at the end of the
                        funding. However, this is not practical as most projects
                        are not really finished until the very last moment of
                        the grant, if that. At the end of a grant there is
                        usually a rush to finish what you said you would do and
                        therefore no time to step back, consider what was done,
                        and carefully document and deposit the project. For
                        these reasons you should hold back some resources to be
                        able to deposit a project after it has ended, not while
                        it is ending.</li><li class="item">Grant funders should consider small post-award deposit
                        funding grants that large projects can apply for once
                        the project is over, the digital work done, and budget
                        spent. </li><li class="item">Projects are often associated with individual
                        academics. These academics change institutions. Digital
                        humanists and institutions should therefore be willing
                        to take ongoing responsibility even when people move
                        away from institutions where they developed projects. At
                        the very least, institutions should be prepared to help
                        document and deposit projects even when faculty move on,
                        and individuals should be prepared to finish off
                        projects and deposit them even though they may have gone
                        to different jobs.</li><li class="item">Institutional and government stakeholders need to
                        expect and invest in the long-term preservation of data.
                        The poor rate of depositing research data documented by
                        the NRAC Working Group (2001) is due to a number of
                        factors including lack of trusted institutional
                        repositories staffed to explain the importance of
                        depositing data to researchers. There is also a lack of
                        understanding of the long-term commitment needed for
                        such repositories to fulfill their function.
                        Repositories can be set up and then abandoned for other
                        priorities. Unfortunately, we seem to be in a time where
                        no one wants to make long-term commitments.</li><li class="item">Articles about projects, like this one, that are
                        published and preserved by libraries are likely to be an
                        important way that researchers in the future learn about
                        projects. It may seem superfluous to document how a web
                        site that is still online and usable works, but given
                        how quickly a web site can disappear, published reports,
                        white papers, and articles can be an important
                        end.</li></ul></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">The most important lesson from our experience is that it is
                    difficult and time consuming to deposit research materials.
                    Until more people actually start depositing datasets and
                    institutions start encouraging deposit, it will continue to
                    be so. There is precious little discussion and experience
                    for guidance. A second lesson is that so much of the idea of
                    long-term preservation is just that — an idea. In principle
                    there are many places that can accept deposits, but in
                    practice it isn’t always easy. Repositories come and go;
                    some have even had their funding pulled back. Support also
                    comes and goes, leaving academics confused about the
                    importance of this and how to do it.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">We believe that by depositing in multiple forms, in multiple

                    casket, ready for reanimation or reuse. Perhaps no one will
                    be interested, but that isn’t for us to say. Let the worms
