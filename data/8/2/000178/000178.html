                  "close" and "distant reading"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>] as they are played out in both the
               fields of world literature and digital literary studies. It
               proposes an alternative digital humanities approach to the study
               of world literature, advocating new methods of close comparative
               reading rather than the mode of "distant reading" endorsed
               by Franco Moretti and Alan Liu [<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>].
               Specifically, the research method proposed here is focused on a
               close reading of the novel <cite class="title italic">The Secret
                  Scripture</cite> (2008) by Irish author Sebastian Barry, with
               comparative reference to Pat Barker’s well-known war novel <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite> (1997). Through the
               development and implementation of a digital humanities research
               method which facilitates new forms of digital literary analysis,
               we demonstrate that close reading and digital humanities can too
               be "practicing partners" in a way that serves to advance
               work in both the fields of world literature and digital literary
               studies.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction: World Literature, Distant Reading and the
               Digital Humanities</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Since the publication of Franco Moretti’s controversial essay
                  "Conjectures on World Literature"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>], "distant reading" has become a
               buzzword among scholars in the literary studies community.
               Distant reading, understood in opposition to "close reading"
               is, according to Moretti, a method of analysis which "allows you to focus on units that are much
                  smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes
                  – or genres and systems"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 51]. In tracing patterns as
               they occur across large corpora of texts, Moretti’s methodology
               is increasingly dependent on quantitative research methods and
               data visualization techniques. Owing to the close affinity
               between Moretti’s distant reading and these methods, Alan Liu has
               recently suggested that the concept has brought the digital
               humanities into closer proximity with the traditional humanities
               discipline of literary studies: "the digital
                  humanities are now what may be called the <em class="emph">practicing
                     partner</em> of distant reading"[<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 492–3]. Interestingly, however, few
               literary scholars have acknowledged or addressed the digital
               humanities methodologies underlying Moretti’s concept.<a class="noteRef" href="#d38371e174">[1]</a>Similarly, few digital
               humanists consider distant reading within the context it was
               first proposed, namely, within the field of world literature.
               Subsequently we find that while members within both the literary
               and the digital humanities communities are purportedly addressing
               the same concept, they are doing so in quite different ways and
               from still divergent standpoints.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This paper aims to bring together the two strands of these
               debates and by doing so to advance current understandings of the
               relationship between digital humanities and the literary
               practices of distant and close reading — the latter practice, we
               argue, being too quickly jettisoned within recent studies. Taking
               a work of contemporary Irish fiction,<cite class="title italic">The
                  Secret Scripture</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#barry2008">Barry 2008</a>], as a case study, we describe the
               evolution and implementation of an innovative new research
               method, incorporating digital humanities and traditional literary
               methodologies which enable an enhanced form of close reading of
               the novel within a world literature framework. Situating our
               research within the debate between modes of close and distant
               reading, we focus on what Moretti has identified as the element
               of literary texts for which modes of distant reading are unable
               to account, i.e."local narrative voice"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>]. We describe the development and
               implementation of a digital humanities tool and methodology which
               support a close reading of this particular textual feature within
               a comparative framework. In its second iteration, the software is
               expanded to include the input of multiple literary scholars as
               they engage with the text. In concluding, we argue that the
               digital humanities approach endorsed in our case study shows that
               close reading and digital humanities can too be "practicing
                  partners"[<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 493] in a way that serves to
               advance work in both the fields of world literature and digital
               literary studies.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Distant Reading and World Literature</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">In the field of literary studies, the methodological debates
               regarding close and distant readings have become inescapably
               intertwined with questions as to the relative status of national
               and world literatures respectively. In "Conjectures on World Literature", Moretti takes issue
               with the tendency in literary scholarship to study literature
               within national contexts only and to endorse practices of close
               reading which he describes as the "very
                  solemn treatment of very few texts taken very
                  seriously"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 57]. Against such limited
               approaches to the diverse and vast field of the world’s
               literature, Moretti maintains that the main goal of distant
               reading and of world literature is to provide a "thorn in the side, a permanent intellectual
                  challenge to national literatures"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 68]. Distant reading, according
               to Moretti, "allows you to focus on units
                  that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices,
                  themes, tropes — or genres and systems"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 57] and, in so doing, to
               comprehend the literary system as a whole rather than as it
               manifests in national contexts only.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In<cite class="title italic">What is World Literature?</cite> (2003),
               David Damrosch, another leading figure in the world literature
               debate, establishes the labels "specialist" and
                  "generalist" readings to distinguish between national and
               global approaches to literary scholarship respectively. The term
                  "specialist" refers to an approach or an individual
               concerned with studying literary works within their culture of
               origins and national literary tradition; practitioners endorsing
               specialist methodologies are characterized by a concern with
               close textual reading and the endorsement of modes of
               microcriticism. Conversely, "generalist" refers to
               approaches characterized by a "high level of
                  cultural abstraction"[<a class="ref" href="#damrosch2003b">Damrosch 2003b</a>, 329] and a refusal to engage
               with the specificities of individual literary works or their
               place within a specific national literature. In recent years, the
               generalist approach has become most readily identified with
               Moretti’s mode of "distant reading."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">However, even within Moretti’s arguments for extending analysis
               beyond the confines of national literature, the necessity for a
               specialist, local knowledge is occasionally acknowledged. In
                  "Conjunctures on World Literature,"
               he concedes that "the narrator’s voice" is the "key variable element" that disrupts a
               distant or generalist approach to literature [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 65–6]. As the embodiment of
                  "local form" through "local narrative
                  voice,""the narrator is the pole of comment, of
                  explanation, of evaluation"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 66]; when "foreign 'formal patterns' (or actual foreign presence,
                  for that matter) make characters behave in strange ways […]
                  then of course comment becomes uneasy — garrulous, erratic,
                  rudderless"[<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 66]. Tellingly, it is at this
               point — that of "local narrative voice" — that the
               generalist must yield to the specialist’s knowledge and methods
               of close reading in order to make sense of the "erratic"
               comment that the local narrator relays.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Having called attention to both the potential value and the
               limitations of both generalist and specialist approaches,
               Damrosch notes that the key challenge facing scholars concerned
               with the study of world literature is the establishment of a
               methodology which enables the researcher to "mediate between broad, but often reductive, overviews and
                  intensive, but often atomistic, close readings"[<a class="ref" href="#damrosch2003a">Damrosch 2003a</a>, 26]. The solution he proposes
               is that world literature can best be read by combining both
               specialist and generalist approaches: rather than adapting the
               role of either generalist or specialist in the study of world
               literature, Damrosch suggests it is more useful to endorse a both
               / and approach. He points out that when our purpose is not to
               delve into a culture in detail, "the reader
                  and even the work itself may benefit from being spared the
                  full force of our local knowledge," and that the
               generalist "will find much of the
                  specialist’s information about the work’s origins is no longer
                  relevant and not only can be but should be set aside"[<a class="ref" href="#damrosch2003c">Damrosch 2003c</a>, 517]. Conversely, the
               specialist’s knowledge serves as the major safeguard against the
               generalist’s "own will to power over texts
                  that otherwise become all too easily grist for the mill of a
                  preformed historical argument or theoretical system"[<a class="ref" href="#damrosch2003c">Damrosch 2003c</a>]. Hence Damrosch argues that "systemic approaches need to be counter balanced
                  with close attention to particular languages and specific
                  texts"[<a class="ref" href="#damrosch2003a">Damrosch 2003a</a>, 26] which will enable the
               generalist to understand the work effectively in its new cultural

               unacknowledged, relevance for newly emerging digital humanities
               literary methodologies. Instead, Moretti’s terms have tended to
               dominate the field and in recent years a growing number of works
               in digital literary studies have explicitly endorsed modes of

               to analyze large corpora of texts in order to identify patterns
               as they occur within the wider literary field, and thus to move
               literary studies beyond the confines of literary canons [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#wilkens2012">Wilkens 2012</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#heuser2011">Heuser 2011</a>]. Conversely, Tanya Clement has employed

               however, the formal features of the text or texts under
               examination are read at a remove from the cultural context in
               which they are either produced or read.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">In his article "Where is Cultural Criticism
                  in the Digital Humanities?", Alan Liu has termed the
               lack of engagement with cultural criticism as a key
                  "deficit" for digital humanities. In this scenario,
               distant reading — understood as a "catch-all" for
               long-established "cultural-critical methods" — becomes the
               post-Cold War savior and the means to break an earlier
               formalist-culturalist détente: "Sophisticated
                  digital humanities methods that require explicit programmatic
                  instructions and metadata schema now take the ground of
                  elemental practice previously occupied by equally
                  sophisticated but tacit close reading methods"[<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 493–4]. For Liu, the contrast in
               new practice is so "stark" as to change "the very nature of the ground being fought over: the
                  text" as "block quotations serving
                  as a middle ground for fluid movement between close and
                  distant reading are disappearing from view," and are
               increasingly replaced as "objects of
                  sustained focus" by "data
                  visualizations of large patterns"[<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>, 494]. While Liu’s arguments
               concerning cultural criticism have a compelling and mobilizing
               force, his jettisoning of close reading and of block quotations
               as subjects of enquiry for digital humanities is, in our view,
               premature. Nor, as this paper will show, need a partnership of
               close reading and digital humanities, informed by recent
               developments in world literature, operate in isolation from

               present-day Ireland and tells the story of the 100-year old
               Roseanne Clear who was incarcerated in the Sligo Mental Asylum at
               some point during the mid-twentieth century. The story is relayed
               through a double narrative: the personal recollections of
               Roseanne relayed in her "Testimony of
                  Herself" and the observations made by her psychiatrist,
               Dr. Grene, in his own investigation into Roseanne’s admittance
               into the hospital, which are recorded in his "Commonplace Book." Although the novel shifts between
               the first-person narratives of Roseanne and that of Dr. Grene,
               Roseanne’s voice is the more prominent of the two throughout the
               novel.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">While<cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>has enjoyed
               a very positive reception and a number of literary awards, some
               divergence exists among critics in their evaluation of the
               efficacy of the narrative voice. For many critics and readers,
               Roseanne’s voice is what renders the story being recounted so
               powerful. Writing for <cite class="title italic">The Daily
                  Telegraph</cite>, David Robson goes so far as to argue that
               in Roseanne Clear, Barry has "created one of
                  the most memorable narrators in recent fiction"[<a class="ref" href="#robson2008">Robson 2008</a>]. Robson’s claim was echoed by Matthew
               Parris, chair of the 2008 Costa Book Award judging panel, who
               argues that in Roseanne, "Sebastian Barry has
                  created one of the great narrative voices in contemporary
                  fiction" (Parris quoted in <cite class="title italic">The
                  Daily Telegraph</cite>, 2 May 2008). However, curiously, and
               as recorded by the <cite class="title italic">Independent</cite>Arts
               Correspondent on 28 January 2009, the judges awarded the prize to
               Barry in spite of their explicit acknowledgement that the book
               was "flawed in many ways." The
               strongest criticism was generated by the novel’s ending while
               another critique centred on the "voice" of Dr. Grene. For
               Parris, "it was the narrative strength of the
                  central character, Roseanne, which helped Barry triumph…. In
                  Roseanne, a narrator had been created that is so transcendent
                  that it redeems all of the structural weaknesses of the

               also generated strong critical scepticism regarding the
               credibility of her voice. Writer Adam Roberts takes issue with
               the plausibility of the prose allocated to Roseanne, arguing that
                  <blockquote><p>I’ve only known one 100-year old, and she

                  sufficiently distinct voices"[<a class="ref" href="#hanks2008">Hanks 2008</a>]. According to Hanks, Dr Grene was
               educated in England, and at one point says that nobody could
               mistake him for an Irishman, whereas he is at times almost stage
               Irish. The book is also marred by a self-consciously literary
               quality, manifested in Roseanne’s improbable attachment to Sir
               Thomas Browne’s Religio Medici and the predictable unreliability
               of the narrators [<a class="ref" href="#hanks2008">Hanks 2008</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">A second and related significant thread within critical reception
               of the novel is its status as "national narrative." While
               Roseanne’s narrative relays a subjective account of her own
               personal history, numerous critics have noted the conflation
               between personal history and Irish history that occurs in <cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>. Anna Leach calls
               attention to the fact that "as the country of
                  Ireland, or Éire, is often represented as a woman, it is not
                  difficult to see parallels between the plight of Roseanne,
                  beautiful and abused, and the plight of the country"[<a class="ref" href="#leach2008">Leach 2008</a>]. Writing for <cite class="title italic">The
                  New York Times</cite>, Art Winslow notes that in <cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>, "personal fate and national fate are incestuously
                  bound" (16 January 2009). And according to the
               publishing blurb circulated by publisher Faber and Faber, "Roseanne’s story becomes an alternative, secret,
                  history of Ireland" (faberandfaber.co.uk, 2008).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">The extent, however, to which Barry has been successful in
               combining personal history with national history has also
               produced disagreement among critics and readers. For Leach,
               Roseanne’s story is at times "rendered more
                  symbolic than human," which she sees as ultimately
               weakening the credibility of Barry’s plot [<a class="ref" href="#leach2008">Leach 2008</a>]. Similarly, Deborah Cameron, writing for
               ABC Sydney, also questions the degree to which Barry successfully
               portrays both a personal and a national narrative through
               Roseanne’s first-person narrative: she asks whether Roseanne
                  "live[s] and breathe[s] as an independent
                  character" or if she is "a puppet,
                  jerked around to illustrate various events from Ireland’s
                  past"[<a class="ref" href="#cameron2009">Cameron 2009</a>]. Underlying this particular issue is
               a suggestive and significant debate regarding the novel’s attempt
               to convey both a personal and national trauma, not only as a
               historical event but one of acute relevance to contemporary
               Ireland.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction to Digital Humanities Research Method</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">The case study constructed by this paper is thus shaped by the

                  Scripture</cite>beyond an Irish context and tradition,
               following Damrosch, we employ a comparative approach [<a class="ref" href="#damrosch2003b">Damrosch 2003b</a>, 329]. As Damrosch notes, "to be effective, a comparison of disparate works
                  needs to be grounded in some third term or set of concerns
                  that can provide a common basis for analysis"[<a class="ref" href="#damrosch2009">Damrosch 2009</a>, 46]. Specifically, we include
               a comparison of Barry’s work to Pat Barker’s well-known novel,
                  <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite> (1995) as a
               narrative also structured around the dialogical relationship of
               patient and therapist. Set in Britain in the early twentieth
               century, <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite> is based on
               the real-life experiences of British army officers being treated
               for shell shock during World War I at Craiglockhart War Hospital
               in Edinburgh. Its narrative relays the treatment of soldiers
               suffering mental breakdown and is shaped predominantly around the
               discussions which the psychiatrist Dr. Rivers has with a number
               of patients within the asylum in which he works, most notably
               those with the war poet, Siegfried Sassoon. In narratological
               terms, Barker’s novel utilizes the narrative technique of
                  "free-indirect discourse," which shifts between various
               characters’ perspectives throughout and which facilitates an
               especially complex and layered narrative. Thus, like <cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite> provides an account of an
               individual trauma which is also intimately related to a wider
               historical trauma inherent within its culture of origins, and
               whose successful narrative realisation depends on a subtle use of
               voice and focalized discourse. Our comparative approach is
               therefore deliberately situated in and constructed through the
               specificities of texts — in thematic content and in narrative
               form — from which contrasts and similarities emerge. In this case
               study, the two novels under discussion each offer a fictional
               depiction of personal and cultural trauma, conveyed through
               extended narrative dialogue, and a key objective is to advance
               readers’ understanding of the complex interoperation of form and
               theme in these novels.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">As an interdisciplinary humanities and computer science team, we

               narrative voice. In the second stage of the case study, as

               text — the Irish novel <cite class="title italic">The Secret

               research method, based on close textual reading of blocks of
               selected text. Specifically, we chose to pay particular attention
               to the interrelation of narrative voice and narrative theme, and,
               within the area of theme, to references to trauma and to cultural
               context with a view to elucidating not only the text’s
                  "generalist" and "specialist" dimensions but,
               crucially, also their interrelationship. As will be discussed in

               dialogue between patient and therapist; and (c) identify the
               degree to which the narrative is autodiegetic. Secondly, the

               significantly extending the existing possibilities of literary

               three elements: 1) narrative structure, 2) trauma and 3) cultural
               context, by firstly identifying these characteristics within the
               text, and then examining their relationship to one another.
               Investigation of the relationships was undertaken with the aid of
               a visualization tool, designed to render XML-encoded data, and
               support the practices in comparative analysis.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Initially, an analysis of researcher activities led to four
               primary use cases providing key design requirements and
               constraints for the visualization tool, i.e. it should be
               web-based to support sharing and collaborative viewing or
               working; it should support simultaneous rendering of XML-encoded
               narrative for two texts (for example, two encodings of the same
               text or two encodings of different texts); it should render
               annotations associated with encoded elements; and it should
               provide a means for visual overlapping functionality to support
               inspection of encoding differences and similarities, for example,
               overlapping encoded segments of cultural and trauma indicators
               within a single text. The associated XML schema was also derived
               from these use cases.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Both novels were to be examined for their narrative structure:
               thus the first phase of encoding utilised a single schema
               designed for marking the type of narrator being used, e.g. an
               omniscient narrator, or the deployment of one of the characters
               as narrator. The narrative techniques employed in both texts are
               intricate and complex. For example, in<cite class="title italic">The
                  Secret Scripture</cite>, the auto-diegetic nature of the
               narrative required a means of distinguishing between when the
               narrator was narrating or speaking to another character. In
                  <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite>an omniscient
               narrator sporadically appears, with extensive focalizing through
               a character’s viewpoint. Responding to these challenges, in a
               reflexive and iterative process, we developed the encoding scheme
               to include an activity attribute, which was introduced to record
               whether the narrator was "doing" (i.e. moving, looking away
               and so forth), "speaking,""thinking," or "narrating." In addition, a
                  "focalizing" activity was further introduced to enable
               the analyst to indicate when free-indirect discourse was being
               employed in Barker’s novel. This was deemed a necessary
               development as, although the omniscient narrator is employed
               frequently throughout the text, it is most often focalized
               through the perspective of Dr. Rivers. Hence in order to
               determine the degree to which a particular character serves as
               the "pole of comment" within the novel, it was necessary to
               establish a means of indicating where the narrative is relayed
               through their perspective. An example of the encoding for
               narrative structure can be seen in Figure 1, which shows an
               excerpt from <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite>where
               Sassoon is discussing hallucinations with his therapist.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">The second phase of encoding involved marking characteristics of
                  "trauma and cultural context" within the text. One of the
               aims of the research was to investigate the textual relationship
               between these two characteristics; as such they wereindependently
               marked into the text that had already been marked for narrative
               structure (as above). This process produced two encodings for
               each novel. One encoding made explicit the text associated with
               trauma (see Figure 2), the other encoding made explicit the text
               associated with cultural context (see Figure 3). The relationship
               between the two themes could then be compared and contrasted
               either within a single novel, or each theme could be examined
               across the two novels. This was achieved by rendering these
               encodings within the software environment.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure02.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure02.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div></div></div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure03.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure03.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 3. </div></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">The aforementioned developments are examples of the enhanced
               attention to the literary conventions and functions of narrative
               structure demanded by the encoding process. As the act of
               encoding demanded that the analyst identify and name the various
               narrative techniques employed in the two novels under
               examination, through this digital humanities process, she was
               brought into a deeper engagement with the formal features of the
               texts, thus bringing her to an increased awareness of how the
               perspectives generated by both novels were constructed and the
               complexity of their structure.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">The process of encoding further served to enhance the analyst’s
               engagement with the manner in which cultural context is made
               manifest throughout the two novels. In marking the indicators of
               cultural context, it was discovered that there were various types
               thereof within the passages. For example, within both novels
               there are direct references to specific place names, such as
               Lough Gill in <cite class="title italic">The Secret
               Scripture</cite>and Craiglockhart in <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite>. However, there are also less explicit
               indicators such as the use of colloquialisms within the dialogue.
               Similarly, when marking up indicators of trauma it emerged that
               the trauma tag was also being applied to both overt and covert
               indicators of trauma. For example, in <cite class="title italic">The
                  Secret Scripture</cite>, Dr. Grene explicitly refers to
               traumatic events in Roseanne’s life, such as her incarceration.
               Such</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">indicators are notably different in kind to the silence that the

               are not one and the same, it became necessary to distinguish
               between the various types. Subsequently, "implicit" and
                  "explicit" descriptors were included, and implemented as
               attributes on the relevant tags in order to allow the encoder to
               specify the differences between the various types of indicators.
               Again the process of encoding and the degree of specificity that
               was permitted by the development of appropriate XML tags brought
               the analyst into a deeper engagement with how cultural context
               and trauma are interlinked throughout both<cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>and <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite> (to be discussed in detail under
               Critical Analysis).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">The schema design was undertaken using an iterative design
               process where a basic design is enhanced over time through
               engagement with the source and the project collaborators. This
               well-established approach to data modelling takes cognisance of
               the hermeneutic spiral created as soon as a source is examined
               through a certain lens (in this case, for markers of trauma and
               cultural context), and seeks to account for the expected
               requirement drift associated with this growing understanding. For
               instance, through this iterative process, differences emerged as
               to what the various researchers considered to be indicators of
               cultural context and trauma and whether they were explicit or
               implicit. The discussions and debates that ensued brought to
               light the subjective nature of this interpretative process; thus
               we considered it useful and necessary to capture the reasoning
               behind each markup decision. Hence, a "comment" attribute
               was added to the cultural context and trauma tags to record such
               content. This form of annotation seemed more appropriate for this
               research, rather than adopting, or developing a complete
               annotation system. Furthermore, this approach aligned well with
               the researcher’s modus operandi of simultaneously identifying
               some indicator and giving a reason, rather than annotating some
               textual element afterwards which is a different use case.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">Visualisation of the encodings was achieved using a
               custom-designed and developed software tool.  The design was
               driven using standard web-development software engineering
               techniques and paradigms, for example, use case analysis,
               iterative design and design patterns. In order to enhance the
               comparative analysis of the various encodings both within and
               across texts, we determined that the interface should be divided
               to contain two scroll panes. This approach would provide the
               researcher with a method to quickly navigate pairs of XML-encoded
                documents. Each pane was given an associated dropbox providing
               the user with a list of available, and uniquely identifiable,
               encodings. The user can select which novels and which encodings
               (trauma or cultural context) he/she wishes to compare (Figure 4).
               The choice of novels and encodings is determined by whether the
               user wishes to compare the encodings as they appear within an
               individual text or to conduct a comparative analysis of either
               cultural context or trauma as they appear in both novels.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">The technologies used were XHTML, XML, XSLT and JavaScript, and
               Perl; all deployed in a client-server architecture.  The panels
               were realised in XHTML.  Many of the interactive elements of the
               tool were realised using JavaScript.  The panels used updatable
              &lt;div&gt; elements that had accompanying JavaScript functions
               for repositioning, changing the z-index (overlapping order), and
               adjusting the transparency of the text background. Both the text
               and the visual-aid colours and symbols within the panels were
               generated from the XML encodings using XSLT.  When the panels are
               overlapped in the centre of the page, the backgrounds become
               transparent in order to view overlapping color-coded markup
               segments. Transparency management was achieved by manipulating
               the the z-index of the panels, and the transparency of the panel
               &lt;div&gt; elements. Both panels also implement co-operative
               JavaScript scrolling event handlers which, if selected,
               automatically scroll the other panel if the user is examining the
               same text (but different encodings) in both panels. The tooltip
               feature was also custom developed using Javascript.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure04.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure04.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Colored speech bubbles were deployed to designate the various

               had determined that a useful further development of the software

               possibility of having multiple scholars comment on a text or

               apply CSS to the resultant XHTML, within a &lt;div&gt; element.
               This meant that a two-step process was developed, whereby the XSL
               stylesheets were applied to the encodings and then saved as XHTML
               in order to support dynamically changing the encoding of interest
               in one of the panels. There are other reasonable, and more

               implications of "narrative voice"; as noted earlier, in the
               case of<cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite> this was
               a contested aspect in evaluations of the novel and, more
               generally, an important fault-line for distant and close readings
               of texts. While some analysis of the respective narrative
               structures would be possible without the software, the
               visualization thereof enabled the user to compare more readily
               the various narrative techniques and, in this case study, some
               illuminating and dynamic textual features emerged.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">The visualization of the narrative structure in both texts
               revealed that although the passages selected from the two novels
               were chosen on the basis that they contained dialogue between the
               patient and therapist, the amount of information that is relayed
               in conversation between the patient and therapist is notably less
                  in<cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>than in
                  <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite>. This was somewhat
               surprising as unlike <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite>,
               an omniscient narrator does not feature in <cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>. However, the visualization of
               the encoding of the narrative structure also highlights the
               degree to which <cite class="title italic">The Secret
               Scripture</cite>is autodiegetic, whereby Roseanne, the novel’s
               protagonist, narrates the story in which she herself is a
               character.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">The autodiegetic nature of the narrative is significant in that
               Roseanne, while refusing to dispense much information to Dr.
               Grene, provides the reader with the details of her story. Hence,
               the reader becomes the narrator’s confidant. This intimate
               relationship between narrator and reader created through the use
               of a specific narrative technique calls attention to the powerful
               function of a local narrative voice within the novel. By
               visualizing the encodings of cultural context and trauma within
               those of the novels’ narrative structures, the software further
               enabled the analyst to examine visually how the formal features
               of narrative, or the "style," interact with the
               narratological "discourse," that is, with the precise
               details of the story being told (see [<a class="ref" href="#shen2008">Shen 2008</a>, 136–149]).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Interestingly, in Version 1 of the software, the segments of
               texts marked up as indicative of trauma in<cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>appear most frequently either in
               Dr. Grene’s dialogue or within Roseanne’s narration, not, as one
               might expect, in her response to the therapist who questions her
               on the very matter. The interaction of form and content thus
               revealed emphasizes Roseanne’s unwillingness to voice her trauma.
               As Roseanne’s trauma was due in part to a patriarchal, Irish
               society denying her a voice with which to assert herself or her
               rights, the narrative structure directly supports the thematic
               content of the novel. More generally, it reflects the physical
               and social silencing of women in Ireland in the early to mid
               twentieth century and the difficulties in accessing their
               stories. Here, then, the status of Barry’s novel as national
               narrative is directly related to, and dependent upon, the power
               of the personal narrative. Our digital method makes visible not
               only this intricate relationship but further illuminates the
               subtle effect of Barry’s technique; contrary to the views of some
               critics that his style is "overwritten", it is at crucial
               times "underwritten" — operating through telling gaps and
               silences as well as through what is directly expressed.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">Conversely, in <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite>, trauma
               indicators are distributed more evenly across the discourse
               between the patient and the therapist and the omniscient
               narration. However, on closer inspection, one notices that when
               omniscient narration is employed, it is focalized predominantly
               through the character of Dr. Rivers due to the author’s use of
               free-indirect discourse. Thus, the indicators of trauma in <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite> are presented more
               frequently through the therapist’s perspective. Once again, a key
               aspect of Barker’s style, and one which has strong thematic
               significance, is made visible and explicable by our method. It is
               worth noting in this regard that Barker’s use of narrative
               structure in turn exemplifies the approach to psychotherapy
               actually employed by the historical Dr. Rivers. As Robert
               Hemmings has noted: <blockquote><p>Rivers developed a
                  therapeutic treatment based upon the principle of catharsis
                  whereby the patient was encouraged to eschew repressive
                  tendencies and give voice to the traumatic memories […]
                  without dwelling excessively upon them. Patient and physician
                  would work together to construct from these painful memories a
                  narrative that found some tolerable, or redeeming, even
                  pleasant association for the trauma. [<a class="ref" href="#hemmings2005">Hemmings 2005</a>, 114]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">Utilizing the visualization aspect more extensively, the analyst
               overlapped the encodings for both novels in order to compare to
               what extent the traumas depicted in <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite>and <cite class="title italic">The Secret
                  Scripture</cite>were culturally specific. As both novels are
               related to events that have caused a "cultural trauma" to
               the respective nations in which they are set, the analyst
               expected to discover a significant degree of overlap between the
               encodings of trauma and cultural context. However, it emerged
               that the degree of overlap was relatively small. The lack thereof
               inspired the analyst to re-examine the segments of text marked as
               cultural context; this was an act of critical self-reflexivity
               that was made possible by the fact that her encodings had been
               captured and visualized by the software.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">Of the two novels, the overlap occurred most frequently in <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite>. On closer inspection, the
               analyst discovered that her criteria for marking cultural context
               were based predominantly on explicit indicators, such as place
               names, historical personage and colloquialisms, more readily
               identifiable when one reads a novel set in a location less
               immediately familiar to the reader. As <cite class="title italic">Regeneration</cite> is a more overtly historical novel than
                  <cite class="title italic">The Secret Scripture</cite>, it utilizes
               factual information more frequently, which could also account for
               the fact that the analyst marked more indicators of cultural
               context in Barker’s novel than in the Irish text. However, on
               returning to her markup of <cite class="title italic">The Secret
                  Scripture</cite>, the analyst noticed that she had failed to
               encode a number of significant elements of the text that were
               related to cultural context due to her limited definition of
               indicators of cultural context. More so than Barker, Sebastian
               Barry employs a prose style which is "full of gleaming
                  images" (Gatti, <cite class="title italic">The Times</cite> 1
               May 2008) and it is through his creative use of images that he
               ties his novel more implicitly to an Irish cultural context. For
               example, Roseanne’s references to "salmon" evoke an image
               that is intimately bound not only to the Irish environment, but
               also to Irish mythology owing to its associations with stories
               relating to the Irish Fianna and specifically the legend of the
                  <em class="emph">bradán feasa</em>or salmon of knowledge. Contrary to
               the critique cited earlier (that Barry’s novel elevates the
               symbolic over the human), symbolic references are used to suggest
               layers of psychological insight and, relatedly, psychological
               damage.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">An examination of the encoded responses of more than one analyst
               is a much more challenging comparative task. In the case of the
               various participants in <cite class="title italic">The Secret
                  Scripture</cite> case study (Version 2), the analyst found
               that a significant consensus occurred across the participants in
               relation to their selection of moments in the text for markup,
               and especially so in relation to cultural context. This relative
               conformity may be partially attributed to the criteria set for
               the exercise. It may also be due in part to the fact that the
               contributors were all specialists in the field of Irish studies.
               While the revelation of consensus was in itself a research
               benefit, as it provided evidence as to the manner in which
               literary scholars engage with a text, the general conformity also
               served to make the differences, and their accompanying rationale,
               all the more notable.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">In the first paragraph of the novel, only two of the six Irish
               contributors marked any of the text as being indicative of
               cultural context, while all four of the international
               participants annotated either specific words or phrases. The
               majority of those who did mark some text in this paragraph marked
               words such as "green field"s, and "folded farms,"
               though their reasoning for doing so varied ("rural imagery,""reference to either Flanders or Ireland", "Ireland or
                  Irish related-images," etc). One participant noted that the
               reference to "green fields" recalled W. B. Yeats’s account
               of "four green fields" in his
                  play<cite class="title italic">Cathleen Ni Houlihan</cite>. In
               contrast, only one participant selected the phrase "Dear reader! Dear reader," marking this
               segment of text as an "implicit" marker of cultural context,
               which recalls the "gothic of Poe or even
                  Baudelaire."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">A notable feature of the annotated markup was its frequent
               substantiation, and justification, in relation to Irish history
               and culture. For example, one Irish scholar marked "the
                  transmigration of the soul" as an implicit indicator of
               cultural context, commenting that: <blockquote><p>Much is
                  made of this idea in <cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite>:
                  could possibly be an allusion to it. But equally possibly not.
                  Certainly this passage has modernist echoes — the classical
                  and the mundane.</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">As previously mentioned, another participant situated the text
               within an Irish literary and cultural tradition by tracing a
               connection between Sebastian Barry’s novel and W. B. Yeats’s
               play, <cite class="title italic">Cathleen Ni Houlihan</cite>. The
               impulse to locate the novel within a specific national genealogy
               — and the related hesitation — is especially telling since it
               strikingly re-enacts at the "micro-level" of individual
               readings a central tension within the reception of Barry’s work –
               between those who seek to absorb his writings within a
               nationalist historiographical tradition, reinforcing the status
               of a national literature, and those who view his work as
               presenting a direct challenge to such a unitary national
               tradition. In addition to visualizing these alternative
               interpretations, the digital methodology can also illuminate the
               manner in which the text facilitates, and even invites, both such
               readings. For example, Figure 10 displays how the references to
               World War Two, marked by a number of participants as indicating
               an internationally "shared history," appear in close
               proximity to the brief textual discussion of the struggle for
               liberation in Ireland.</div><div class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure10.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/2/000178/resources/images/figure10.jpg" alt=""/></a></div><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 10. </div></div></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">In conclusion, the fusing of digital humanities with literary
               methodologies of close reading, which is a fundamental
               characteristic of our research project, yields significant
               findings with regard to a literary-critical analysis of the
               chosen case study: Sebastian Barry’s <cite class="title italic">The
                  Secret Scripture</cite>. The complex operations of
                  "narrative voice" in the novel — whereby the most
               powerful indicators of trauma are indirectly conveyed, and
               filtered through the therapist’s perspective — can be elucidated
               and the subtlety of the authorial achievement therein brought to
               light through the practices of markup and annotation. Such a
               technique can in turn inform a wider literary pedagogy,
               illustrating in close detail how form and theme work together;
               this may be particularly useful in teaching undergraduate
               students for whom developing a nuanced understanding of narrative
               technique is often a difficulty encountered in their initial
               years in literary studies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53">A further critically contested area with regard to Barry’s novel
               — namely its status as "national narrative" — is also
               illuminated through our linked literary and digital techniques of
               annotation (recording individual interpretative practices) and
               comparative analysis (the overlap function). As shown above, the
               processes through which indicators of cultural context, implicit
               or explicit, operate in the novel are central to the novel’s
               effect, not least through the varying ways in which those
               potential indicators are identified by readers. Here the reader’s
               own interpretation of what constitutes a marker of cultural
               context becomes the key determinant, and the degree — or absence
               — of consensus among different readers, a fruitful subject of
               study. Thus our case study demonstrates how digital methodologies
               can be deployed, not only to support "generalist" readings,
               but also to analyse how a novel may generate differing or shared
                  "specialist" responses. Its wider significance, within
               the still evolving field of digital literary analysis, is to
               argue for the value of interlinked textual and cultural analysis
               that delves into the specificities of texts; contra Liu,
                  "block quotations" still retain value as the "objects

                  share of their work is best done in collaboration with other
                  people"[<a class="ref" href="#damrosch2003c">Damrosch 2003c</a>, 286]. Those "other
                  people," to whom Damrosch refers, now include colleagues in
               digital humanities and computer science, working in collaboration
               with colleagues in world literature and literary studies; our own
               case study demonstrates the rich results that can be yielded for
               literary criticism by the collaborative work of an
               interdisciplinary humanities and computer science team whereby
               traditional literary methodologies can be re-activated and
               regenerated rather than abandoned.</div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d38371e174"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>The
