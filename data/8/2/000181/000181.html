               labeled with numbers or letters to facilitate cross-referencing, are widely used but
               seldom studied, undeservedly so. Canonical numbers are complex interpretive
               mechanisms with a great deal of potential for anyone editing and using electronic
               texts. In this essay I consider the rationale for and nature of canonical reference
               systems, to recommend principles to consider when deploying them in digital projects.
               After briefly reviewing the history of canonical references I note how they have been
               used so far, emphasizing the advances made by Canonical Text Services (CTS). I argue
               that the practical and theoretical problems that remain unaddressed require
               engagement with descriptions of how textual scholarship works and how notional
               literary works relate to the artefacts that carry them (using Functional Requirements
               for Bibliographic Records, FRBR). By correlating a theory of canonical reference
               numbers with those two models — editorial workflow and creative
               works — I offer key
               principles that should be addressed when planning, writing, and using digital
               projects. </p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The rationale of canonical references</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Canonical references — e.g., Homer, <cite class="title italic">Iliad</cite> 1.1; John
                  3:16; Sun Zu, <cite class="title italic">The Art of War</cite> 3.6,
                     <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite>, Act III Scene 2 line
               1895 — allow one to
               point to and discuss specific parts of literary works without having to stipulate a
               particular edition or version. Such numbers arose in earnest in the Renaissance as a
               way to place firm anchors in a fluctuating sea of texts, and have ever since been a
               critical means of cross-referencing. In the electronic age the textual sea has grown
               larger and more turbulent, so the anchors provided by canonical numbers are 
               arguably more important now than ever, especially for scholarship. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">For example, formal linguistic research into translations, paraphrases, and other
               acts of textual reuse depends upon the alignment of large corpora of texts. The
               preparatory stages for so-called bitext alignment are notoriously time-consuming
                  [<a class="ref" href="#tiedemann2011">Tiedemann 2011</a>]. There exist good stochastic methods to
               synchronize large units (paragraphs, sentences), but correcting the low level of
               errors still takes work. And by the time the bitexts have been aligned on this rough
               level, the end result is, in essence, a canonical numbering system, usually invented
               ad hoc and incorporated into other projects only after custom conversion.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Canonical reference systems also continue to facilitate everyday discourse about
               familiar literature. A Web publisher can install a javascript library such as
               <a class="ref" href="http://www.reftagger.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.reftagger.com/'); return false">reftagger.com's</a> to automatically add widgets and hyperlinks to inline, naturally
               phrased canonical references that appear in individual pages. A writer doesn't need
               to do any special coding when quoting, and readers, through hover and click events,
               can consult the work that has been cited, in the language or version of choice. Such
               javascript libraries, which are always restricted to a particular textual corpus,
               would be impossible without the shared convention of canonical numbers.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">A shared universal protocol for canonical numbers in electronic
               texts — some protocol
               readable by both computers and humans — would bring enormous benefit to linguists,
               digital humanists, and the public at large. But the challenges in finding such a
               protocol, as I will explain, are numerous and significant. Rather than tackling those
               challenges directly, I step back in this article to explore the history, theory, and
               assumptions that underlie canonical numbers. Briefly setting them in historical
               context, I trace recent efforts to make them viably interoperable in digital
               projects. Initiatives such as Canonical Text Services have made
               critical advances, but
               important theoretical and practical questions remain. I argue that these problems are
               best understood against two backdrops: the process editors follow in their textual
               scholarship, and the model library cataloguers have used to describe creative works
               (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, FRBR). I argue that a comparison
               shows exactly where each of the two major classes of canonical
               numbers — visual and
               semantic — are best suited. Finally, I detail principles that can help digital
               humanists make the most of canonical numbers in electronic texts. Those
               recommendations can be summarized here:</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Innovations in the number and specificity of canonical numbering systems
                     have historically capitalized on new technology. That trend should be
                     encouraged, not hindered.</li><li class="item">Both writers and users of textual data should declare in a computer-parsable
                     manner the numbering schemes they have adopted, the type of each number, and
                     any related normalizations applied to the texts.</li><li class="item">Numbering schemes both point to texts and interpret them. The first function
                     requires stable and familiar numbers; the latter, the freedom to bring new
                     insight into text structures. Digital projects should accommodate both impulses
                     whenever possible.</li><li class="item">The distinction between visual and semantic numbering should always be kept
                     in mind when creating data models and creating and using data. Neither type of
                     number is inherently superior. The suitability of a particular system depends
                     upon the assumptions and purposes of editors and researchers. Specifically: <div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Semantic numbering schemes are a heuristic ideally suited for
                           knowledge, meaning, and insight; visual ones, for text-bearing
                           objects.</li><li class="item">Semantic numbering schemes are easier to apply across multiple
                           versions of a work than visual ones are.</li><li class="item">Visual numbering systems are easier and less controversial to
                           fine-tune with increased specificity than semantic ones are.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">My goal in this article is not to establish a definitive approach to employing
               canonical numbers. The problems, which I think remain numerous and complex, deserve
               sustained reflection. This essay is best seen as a catalyst to that reflection, and
               to experimentation in different practical solutions.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The complex tradition of canonical numbers</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In antiquity, cross-referencing and text segmenting were two unrelated activities.
               The former was served by quotations, paraphrases, allusions, and other types of
               textual reuse, a flexible system that allowed (as it still does) authors a great deal
               of control over the quality, precision, and character of their references. Text
               segmentation, however, began as a way not to provide anchors for reference but to
               shape the semantic contours of the text. Large works would be divided into books or
               poems, e.g., the <cite class="title italic">Iliad</cite> and the
               <cite class="title italic">Histories</cite> of Herodotus, and smaller units were
               marked with individual symbols (e.g., ※,
               ⁖) that identified paragraph-sized
               units [<a class="ref" href="#demoorandkorpel2007">de Moor and Korpel 2007</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#porter2007">Porter 2007</a>]. Such
               segmentation, which relied upon marks that could not be sequenced, signaled the
               borders of logical or semantic units and furnished scribes or writers the means by
               which to shape their readers' interpretation of the text [<a class="ref" href="#korpelandoesch2005">Korpel and Oesch 2005</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#dehoopetal2009">de Hoop, Korpel, and Porter 2009</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e163">[1]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The use of numbers or letters, instead of symbols, so that sub-book units could be
               uniquely and sequentially labeled, is not attested until the Hellenistic/late antique
               period, with the numbering of Greek lyric poetry [<a class="ref" href="#higbie2010">Higbie 2010</a>], the
               subsequent imitative numbering of the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Psalter
                  [<a class="ref" href="#yarchinforthcoming">Yarchin forthcoming</a>], and the numbered division of the four New
               Testament gospels into <span class="foreign i">titloi</span> and <span class="foreign i">kephalaia</span>, a
               structure that became an integral part of the canon tables invented by Eusebius of
               Caesarea (ca. 260–339/40) [<a class="ref" href="#wallraff2013">Wallraff 2013</a>, 6–7], [<a class="ref" href="#zola2012">Zola 2012</a>]. Eusebius's technique for numbering the parts of the four
               gospels could not have existed without the invention of the codex, a book format much
               easier than a scroll was for looking up references. The function was important to
               Eusebius's clientele, because the traditional methods of
               cross-reference — direct and
               indirect quotation — were not helpful for clergy who needed to quickly and
               conveniently find the Gospel passages designated for reading on a particular day. So
               the beginnings of what we know now as canonical reference systems emerged within the
               confluence of, among other things, new needs and new technology.<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e185">[2]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Segmenting and numbering works developed only sporadically and piecemeal through the
               late antique and early medieval period, gaining traction only later and in specific
               locales, particularly thirteenth-century Paris [<a class="ref" href="#vanBanning2007">van Banning 2007</a>].
               This late refinement of numbering schemes was again facilitated (but not determined)
               by social and technological developments such as the transition from scriptoria to a
               highly specialized bookmaking industry, which was eventually succeeded by the first
               printing shops [<a class="ref" href="#rouse2000">Rouse and Rouse 2009</a>]. In this case the enrichment of numbering
               systems was motivated by pedagogy and scholarship, not liturgy. University scholars
               and students who wished to discuss and compare a text and its translation, e.g., a
               Hebrew work translated into Latin, required a rough method of alignment, and the best
               coordinating mechanism was to number the text segments and promulgate the system
               through the managed production and distribution of books [<a class="ref" href="#moore1893">Moore 1893</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e199">[3]</a> Broad
               consensus about numbering schemes, and the creation of complex hierarchies of small
               textual parts (e.g., subchapters) occurred only in the modern era, with the printing
               press, which helped stabilize clear, fixed reference systems [<a class="ref" href="#zola2012">Zola 2012</a>]. Long columns of a printed book could be marked by intercolumnar letters, and
               individual page or chapter lines could be numbered, each copy guaranteed to be
               identical. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Ancient texts critically edited in the modern era are pinned to the scaffolding of
               numbering schemes that have come to be called canonical, much in the same special
               sense Eusebius used κανών [<a class="ref" href="#wallraff2013">Wallraff 2013</a>, 1–2]. That is,
               canonical numbers refer not to what we <em class="emph">ought</em> to read but to items in a
                  <em class="emph">list</em>, i.e., a sequence, whether flat or hierarchical. That canonical
               list allows readers to point to items with precision, clarity, confidence, and
               convenience. These familiar and indispensable numbering schemes have become the basis
               for structuring the texts in digital corpora such as the Thesarus Linguae Graecae
               (TLG, an extensive database of ancient Greek literature) and the CLCLT/Cetedoc
               Library of Latin Texts (a similar database for Latin). </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Despite their convenience, canonical numbers are not always simple. Many ancient and
               medieval works have attracted more than one system, each based on incommensurate
               logic. A reference to Arist., <cite class="title italic">Cat.</cite>
               5.2 (2a14–15) is
               commonly, and without contention, understood to refer doubly to a single passage in
                  Aristotle's <cite class="title italic">Categories</cite>. The first pair of numbers
               points to the medieval-inspired chapter 5, subchapter 2; the latter pair, to the
               modern milestones of the highly influential 1831 Bekker edition: page 2, first
               column, lines 14 and 15. The Bekker labels do not necessarily require one to consult
               the original nineteenth-century version. Any edition or translation that includes his

               widely used and highly regarded, since each serves a different purpose. The medieval
               system elegantly captures passages, <span class="foreign i">sententiae</span>, and logical
               segments; the Bekker numbers pinpoint specific lines, phrases, or words. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Canonical numbering systems are also fertile. They can change with new versions or
               editions. So, for example, the <cite class="title italic">Taktika</cite> compiled by Leo VI
               in the tenth century has different paragraph numeration in the three editions
               published in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries, each shaped by
               the distinct perspective of the editor.<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e233">[4]</a> Some alternative numbering
               schemes take hold and become standard; others face resistance. In some cases
               resistance or support for a particular system stems from assumptions about the origin
               and structure of the text. A good example is the Psalter. The most widely used
               numbering looks to the Hebrew tradition, in which Psalm numbers were not added until
               the tenth century at the earliest (and even then, in a system different from the
               modern one: [<a class="ref" href="#yarchinforthcoming">Yarchin forthcoming</a>]). This numbering differs from that
               used in the oldest Greek translations, anachronistically but usefully called the
               Septuagint (LXX). Most of the Psalm numbers in the Hebrew and the LXX differ by one.
               Such differences might seem trivial today, but to many early Christians the number of
               a Psalm was a key to its interpretation. For example, Didymus the Blind
                     (<cite class="title italic">Commentary on the Psalms</cite>,
               106.24-109.4) held that
               Psalm 50 LXX (51 Hebrew) was to be understood as a revelation that the number fifty,
               wherever it was found in scripture, symbolized repentance. According to Jerome
                     (<cite class="title italic">Homilies on the Psalms</cite> 5), Psalm 14 LXX (15
               Hebrew) was to be read in concert with Exodus 12:6 and the fourteen-day half-cycle of
               the moon. Such interpretive readings corroborated how Christians understood
               themselves and how they characterized those outside the Church. Apologists as early
               as Justin Martyr (fl. 2nd c.) accused the Jews of having altered or dropped parts of
               the Bible that were faithfully preserved by the LXX (e.g., <cite class="title italic">Dial.
                     Tryph.</cite> 71–73).<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e250">[5]</a> Thus, the
               two systems sustain views about the ideal state of the Psalter, and the boundaries of
               individual Psalms (Hebrew 9 and 10 = LXX 9; Hebrew 147 = LXX 146 and 147). To assign
               a number to a Psalm is to take part, even if unwittingly or unwillingly, in old
               Jewish-Christian debates about the priority of one text tradition over the other, and
               the authentic structure of the Psalter. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">These are but a few of the difficulties found in the canonical numbering systems we

               conventions, some used subconsciously, that adhere to readers' expectations for
               clarity and meaning. An object (or its surrogates) might undergo multiple
               transcriptions, but each one can be placed somewhere on this spectrum of graphic to
               semantic, diplomatic to normalized. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">Letter or number labels may be applied to texts at any stage. They tend to come later
               rather than sooner. Numbers are rarely applied to the original object, the numbers
               written by a modern curator in the corners of a manuscript's folios being a rare
               example. On surrogates such as digital images or line drawings, line or object
               numbers might be superimposed. And in transcriptions, numbering is all but
               inevitable. The further along the process, the more likely a scholar is to label and
               number the lines, columns, pages, paragraphs, gaps, or other visible textual units.
               This numbering nudges a transcription, even if very slightly, toward the normalizing
               side of the spectrum, since the editor makes judgments about the boundaries and
               contours of the writing. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">That accounts for textual study of individual objects. Work may then turn to groups
               and collections of objects recognized as carrying similar or identical texts. Where
               sufficiently similar, transcriptions are collated, and aligned and compared where
               they are not. Well-collated transcriptions become the foundation for critical
               editions. And upon these transcriptions, collations, and editions, a whole series of
               other activities depend: translation, annotation, commentary, analysis, and
               interpretation (scholarly or not). This class of work normally addresses questions
               that go beyond the visual features of individual text-bearing objects. What is the
               plot? Does this sentence exhibit sarcasm? What significance does this claim have on
               assessing the price of whale oil in the nineteenth century? Such activities
               necessarily come at the end of a complex trajectory of textual scholarship. Our work
               is rooted in the visual, graphic experience of text-bearing objects, and, without
               ever abandoning those foundations, presses out to the semantic, conceptual, and ideal
               realm. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">My description is, of course, a broad generalization. For any given text, steps could
               be omitted, repeated, or worked on concurrently. Scholars regularly step back and
               oscillate between reflecting on ideas and scrutinizing objects. And anything created
               within this process could itself become the starting point for a chain of scholarship
               to begin anew. My argument depends not upon specific paths taken but upon the overall
               thrust, which is better or poorly served at each stage by the two basic types of
               canonical numbering. Every canonical numbering scheme of a text serves one
               end of this process better than the other. Attending to the physical object, we
               number or label folios, pages, columns, sides, anonymous blocks, lines, glyphs,
               strokes, or Cartesian coordinates. On the semantic side, we label logical or
               conceptual components: books, poems, stanzas, chapters, entries, speeches, sentences,
               clauses, words, letters. Thus, Bekker numbers in Aristotle are object-oriented (page,
               column, line numbers that correspond to the 1831 manifestation) but the medieval
               references are semantic-oriented (chapter, subchapter). Even when those systems are
               repurposed (e.g., Bekker numbers applied to paragraphs), one type of numbering is
               better suited to the text-bearing object, the other to a text's meaning and import. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">All taxonomies and structures respond to and serve the purposes of questions and
               assumptions scholars bring to their research. Canonical numbering systems are such a
               structure. Therefore an object-based canonical numbering scheme is ideally suited to
               serve questions or purposes that are focused on the original text-bearing object (or
               its surrogates) that is the foundation of that system. Similarly, semantic sequences
               help one set aside the variety of physical objects that carry versions of a text so
               one can engage questions of meaning, significance, and importance. Object-based
               canonical numbers nicely accommodate the need to refer to texts with specificity.
               Semantic-based ones tend to support discussions about how works are internally
               structured. The two have different functions; neither is inherently superior. But
               they are each governed by two different domains — physical and
               conceptual — whose
               relationship complicates any reference system that intends to bridge the two worlds. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">Our example CTS URN for the manuscript A of <cite class="title">Iliad</cite>

                  <em class="term">manifestation</em>, and <em class="term">item</em> (sometimes called
                  <em class="term">WEMI</em> as a mnemonic). A <em class="term">work</em> is
               "a distinct intellectual
               or artistic creation" but it is also "an abstract entity"[<a class="ref" href="#ifla2008">IFLA 2008</a>, 17]. The <cite class="title italic">Iliad</cite>, treated as a FRBR work, is to
               be found in no material object — it is an ideal, as is the second tier,
                  <em class="term">expression</em>, "the intellectual or artistic realization of a work....
               [T]he specific intellectual or artistic form that a work takes each time it is
               'realized'." Thus, Aristotle's <cite class="title italic">Categories</cite> may be a work,
               but the lost Greek original, Andronicus's edition, Bekker's edition, and Bodéüs's
               translation would all be expressions of that single work. Works have a one-to-many
               relationship with expressions. Their metadata include descriptions of the creators,
               the subjects, dates of creation, and so forth.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">On the third tier is <em class="term">manifestation</em>, "the physical embodiment of an

               be described. Expressions and manifestations share a many-to-many relationship. Just
               as any expression may be embodied by any number of manifestations (e.g., multiple
               print runs of a book), so any physical object might have multiple creative works
               (e.g., an anthology). Metadata about manifestations usually include descriptions
               about who made the physical artefact, when, where, and so forth. Thus, Bekker's
               edition, its later reprints, and arguably the digital scans housed by Google or
               Archive.org are individual manifestations. Any specific instance of a manifestation
               is described by the fourth and final tier, the <em class="term">item</em>:
               "a single exemplar
               of a <em class="emph">manifestation</em>"[<a class="ref" href="#ifla2008">IFLA 2008</a>, 24]. Examples of an
               item would be the copy of Bekker that sits on the shelf of my library, or the copy
               sold by a bookstore in New York. Manifestations and items form a pair, and like the
               corresponding upper pair (works and expressions), the first stands to the second in a
               one-to-many relationship.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">The hierarchy of WEMI follows the sequence of the creative process. A writer (or

               the mental work becomes physical, that is, when the printing press inks the paper,
               the work is made <em class="emph">manifest</em>, and through distribution the public

               come under sharp criticism, especially by librarians, best seen in the 2012 special
               issue of <cite class="title italic">Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly</cite> (vol.
               50, nos. 5–7). One FRBR difficulty touches on canonical numbering systems, namely,
               how to interpret the definitions of the four Group 1 entities. For example, the
               lavishly illuminated manuscript the <cite class="title italic">Book of Kells</cite>, as
               noted by Ian Fairclough, is not easily and unambiguously modeled in FRBR.<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e696">[22]</a> If
               treated as simply another biblical manuscript, the <cite class="title italic">Book of
                  Kells</cite> would be catalogued as the sole exemplar (item =
               manifestation) of the New Testament Gospels (the work) in Latin translation (the
               expression). And a digital project dependent upon this approach to FRBR would be
               inclined to use the New Testament's traditional canonical reference system. But if
               thought of as a creative work of art in its own right, the <cite class="title italic">Book of
                     Kells</cite> could be reasonably classified simultaneously as work,
               expression, manifestation, and item. To some this approach would be absurd; to
               others — especially those who need to catalogue photographic reprints of the
                    <cite class="title italic">Book of Kells</cite> as independent
               manifestations — it
               would be sensible. A digital project following this interpretation of FRBR would
               would be well suited to use principally folio numbers, columns, and cartesian
               coordinates.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">All other problems aside, FRBR's architecture has salient points of comparison with
               the process of textual scholarship (described above) that touch on canonical numbers.
               Some differences should be immediately evident. For example, textual work begins with
               a physical object and moves up; the FRBR model begins at the opposite end, and moves
                  down.<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e711">[23]</a> The two models describe two different kinds of activities,
               each with a distinct set of necessary conditions. FRBR focuses on the creative
               process that leads from the mind of the writer to the hands and eyes of the readers.
               An account of the workflow of textual scholars describes how they take a preexisting
               artefact and incorporate it into their own creative work. Consequently, a digital
               project that approaches its texts with the FRBR perspective is likely to start with
               semantic canonical numbering as a foundation upon which to superimpose any other
               visual ones. But a project that takes a viewpoint grounded in the sequence of textual
               work is likely to adopt visual numbers as a starting point. Once again, neither
               approach is inherently superior. But in any given project one should always be aware
               which type of system has been given primacy.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">A second obvious difference between editorial work and FRBR's model is in the
               latter's differentiation between <em class="term">manifestation</em> and <em class="term">item</em>.
               Scholars dealing with texts that survive primarily on premodern text-bearing objects
               will nearly always be dealing fundamentally with unica perhaps best thought of as
               item-manifestations. No manuscript or carving is identical to another, regardless of
               how closely a copy imitates its model. This distinction then is of little consequence
               to some canonical numbering systems, but of great importance to those that must
               include both manifestations and items as distinct categories, for example, projects
               that compare inscriptions on coins or seal impressions (among the few ancient
               artefacts that can be described in terms of manifestations) or that compare different
               print impressions of a book. Any canonical numbering convention
               that disallows manifestations or requires them runs the risk of excluding certain classes of
               texts.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Some points of comparison between FRBR and scholarly practice are tempting to
               construe as differences, but those differences are only superficial. The most salient
               for canonical numbering pertains to what CTS calls text groups or collections, e.g.,
               the collected works of Homer. This class is treated as a conscious departure from
               FRBR [<a class="ref" href="#smith2009">Smith 2009</a>, 19–21]. But that deviation may be more
               apparent than real since, in fact, FRBR allows works to encompass, and to be
               encompassed by, other works, so-called aggregating works. For example, the Bible, the
               New Testament, the Gospels, Matthew, and the Lord's Prayer can all be legitimately
               classified as FRBR works [<a class="ref" href="#ifla2008">IFLA 2008</a>, 29].<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e734">[24]</a> That complexity makes it impossible to introduce a FRBR Group 1 entity higher
               than work, even if it were desirable.<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e745">[25]</a> Deliberating over how works relate to collections,
               or works relate to works, importantly affects how one thinks about canonical
               numbering systems. Canonical references, as noted above, follow a hierarchical model,
               which can be represented as a tree. Each node in a hierarchical tree is the child of
               one node and no more, and it does not overlap with its sibling nodes. But a
               hierarchical model cannot fully describe works or collections. Any work may
               incorporate multiple works or collections or be incorporated by multiple works or
               collections, and "sibling" works frequently overlap. So the relationship of works to
               each other — singly or in groups — cannot be described in a tree hierarchy. One needs
               not a hierarchical model but a network one, to express sets and many-to-many
               relations. Thus, any protocol that is meant to deal with the relations that hold
               between textual parts and wholes cannot depend exclusively upon a hierarchical model,
               which will suit only canonical numbers of individual predetermined works.
               Alternatively, if a protocol chooses for practical reasons to adopt a hierarchical
               model not only for canonical references but for their superstructures, then the
               documentation for that protocol should explain how users should convert complex
               work-work or work-collection relations into a simpler
               hierarchical model.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">Now some similiarities between FRBR and editorial work habits,
               particularly those
               that touch on canonical numbering systems. One pertains to the distinction between
               conceptual and material realms. As might already be apparent, object-based numbering
               schemes (e.g., page numbers) correspond to the lower half of the FRBR model (item and
               manifestation); semantic-based ones, e.g., paragraphs, parallel the upper half
               (expression and work). The bottom half of FRBR Group 1 entities is comparatively
               straightforward, implemented by library cataloguers without a great deal of
               confusion. This corresponds to the relatively clear and unambiguous use of
               object-based canonical numbering systems. An editor needs merely to number the pages
               and lines of any transcription, which is rather uncontroversial to do if the writing
               is clear. A reference to the smallest unit in an object-based numbering system, e.g.,
               folio 3v, left column, 7th line, 5th glyph, can be written, read, and cited with
               little potential for confusion — low entropy as it were. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">But the upper half is oftentimes not well understood, and precision can be
               problematic [<a class="ref" href="#peponakis2012">Peponakis 2012</a>]. I have already pointed out how FRBR has
               not attempted to formalize a mechanism to describe how one work relates to another.
               To that should be added the uncertainty about the boundary line between expression
               and work. By FRBR definition, translations are individual expressions of a single
               work. But clearly some translations or adaptations take a life of their own,
               generating other translations or becoming independently culturally significant (e.g.,
               Plautus's plays, or free adaptations of Shakespeare). The transition point, where an
               expression might be legitimately described as a work in its own, is noted but not
               defined by the FRBR model [<a class="ref" href="#ifla2008">IFLA 2008</a>, 29                   3.2.1]. The
               discernment a cataloguer must exercise to distinguish a work from an expression
               resembles the judicious choices a textual scholar makes in devising a semantically
               oriented system of canonical numbers. To divide a text and attach numbers to
               sentences and paragraphs requires interpretive discernment of a sort quite different
               than the one that labels lines and pages of an object. Segmentation of the former
               kind relies upon the contestable interpretation of the boundaries of meaning, much
               like the work-expression and work-work boundaries that must be determined by library
               cataloguers. Some libraries might disagree with how the Library of Congress
               classifies a work, and they would be within their rights to catalogue it as they see
               fit, especially if the decision is in service of the libraries' specialized missions.
               So too in textual scholarship. If the modern editor of a previously edited text
               faults the interpretation that motivated the received semantically oriented canonical
               numbering system, and if the editor cannot adapt it without doing violence to the
               interpretation of the text, then that editor is entirely justified in renumbering. Of
               course this runs the risk of introducing confusion. But it is up to the editor to
               think critically about how a work should be interpreted and to determine whether the
               risk is justified. And it is up to readers and other editors to decide whether or not
               the new system deserves acceptance. Our reasonable desire for a uniform convention
               should not always prevail. All semantic canonical numbering schemes are

               innovation. Chapter numbers in prose came with the codex and served the Church.
               Subchapter and verse numbers came with the book industry and served both the Church
               and the academy. We now have the opportunity to refine to an unprecedented level our
               existing cross-reference systems, and to introduce varieties of new ones, to serve a
               much wider swathe of society. Architects of digital projects should do all they can
               to support that trend, not curtail it.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">Anyone designing and populating digital projects should keep in mind the two types of
               canonical numbering systems, and make decisions accordingly. This is not to say that
               the two types cannot or should not be combined (e.g., Bekker numbers to identify
               paragraphs in Aristotle's <cite class="title">Categories</cite>). There may be
               situations where a mixture would be appropriate. But project architects should be on
               the lookout for cases where a fusion of the two might entail confusion or invalid
               data.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">New or enriched numbering systems should be encouraged, not discouraged. New systems
               should be coordinated with predecessors. Provision should be made, when possible, for
               tables that allow one canonical numbering system to be converted to another. This
               would permit scholars not only to structure and therefore interpret their corpora in
               new ways, but to look afresh at texts through obsolescent numbering schemes that may
               be objects of study in their own right. Consider, for example, an edition of a
               classical text coded to be read not only in its modern segmentation but in an earlier
               one, so that a scholar specializing in sixteenth-century culture might study how the
               classical legacy was then being interpreted.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">Numbering systems should be maximally human readable without sacrificing machine
               parsability, and they should be useful independent of any specific project or
               algorithm. Although not every project will find CTS URNs suitable, their model should
               be studied. For example, the use of the token specifier
               <span class="monospace">#ἐγὼ[1]</span>
               discussed above may make no sense for a particular project that wishes to specify a
               fragment independent of a particular language. But the CTS convention demonstrates an
               important way to attain new levels of specificity in our canonical numbers. Along
               these lines I have argued that object-based numbering schemes offer more precision
               than semantic-based ones do, because the former are not as likely to be confused or
               contested. But that is not to say that granularity in semantic numbering systems are
               impossible; rather, specificity in each of the two types requires different
               strategies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">For object-based numbering systems, there is enormous potential for clear,
               unambiguous, and precise (or precisely fuzzy) cross-referencing. With existing
               technology one can point not just to pages and lines but to shapes, blotches, white
               space, or any spatial region. Thus, project managers do well to accommodate
               descriptions of specific rectangular regions of an image. They do better to support
               polygonal regions. Even better are scalable vector graphics, which can identify the
               most erratically shaped regions in a flat digital image.<a class="noteRef" href="#d978e790">[26]</a> Although there are challenges in
               coordinating and synchronizing the description of a single region across multiple
               digital surrogates of the same object, that difficulty is best addressed not in the
               numbering scheme but in how the surrogates are coordinated. Scholars who are editing
               and labeling texts should not have to negotiate that answer.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">Semantic numbering schemes also have enormous potential for specificity. In theory,
               we could label not just paragraphs and sentences, but semantic units as small as
               words, letters, and accents. For example, one could coin Arist.,
                     <cite class="title italic">Cat.</cite> 5.2.9.2 to refer to the 9th word, 2nd letter of
               Aristotle's  (<span class="bibl"><span class="ref" id="d978e800"><!-- close --></span><cite class="title">Categories</cite></span>) , chapter 5 subchapter 2, i.e., the
               ρ in the word πρώτως ("firstly"). But editors and linguists may legitimately differ
               on how to define semantic units, and even then on how to interpret those definitions.
               At what point does a paragraph or sentence begin and end? What is a word? Does a
               contraction count as one or two? Should a ligature be counted as one or two letters?
               Should combining characters (U+0360..036F) be counted individually or not? How should
               punctuation factor in any word or character counts? [<a class="ref" href="#manningandschuetze1999">Manning and Schütze 1999</a>, 124-136], [<a class="ref" href="#zwickyandpullum1983">Zwicky and Pullum 1983</a>]
               The problem is twofold, because such commitments must be made both by those who
               create transcriptions and by those who use them. If people working on the same
               transcription are in disagreement or confusion about the interpretation of a new
               numbering system, then it cannot be reliably shared. But I believe the challenge
               merits consideration, not despair. If the assumptions and definitions that underlie
               incommensurate semantic numbering schemes could be unambiguously declared, then it
               should be straightforward to develop concordance tables, much like the ones proposed
               above for larger semantic units. The main challenge is to find ways to allow those
               who are preparing a transcription the means to declare, in a machine-readable way,
               what normalization techniques they have imposed upon a text. And those who wish to
               use transcriptions should be provided a similar mechanism, to declare how they have
               defined and interpreted semantic units such as sentences, words, and characters. Both
               mechanisms — one for editors and one for researchers,
               interdependent — would be
               enormously useful. At the same time, if it can be demonstrated that certain kinds of
               declarations are limited, difficult, impossible to make, or impossible to coordinate
               with other declarations, then the philosophical implications for linguistics,
               computing, and logic would be significant, making the effort all the more
               worthwhile.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">Almost every text lends itself to numerous types of milestones that could be used for
               canonical numbering systems. Beyond the simple, straightforward examples of Bible
               chapters and verses, the systems can get quite complex and can be prone to ambiguity.
               To mitigate confusion on the part of both humans and computers, digital projects
               should require canonical numbers to be typed, or they should be clear about what
               default typology has been assumed, so each number or letter clearly corresponds to a
               particular unit. For example, an encoding of Arist., <cite class="title italic">Cat.</cite> 5.2
                  (2a14–15), which cites five different measures, should specify which label
               corresponds to what kind of unit. I defer for now a discussion of how to do this

               it is upon coordinating semantic units (words and phrases) across versions will have
               to deal with segmentation challenges both in the source text and in the translated
               text. For example, the <span class="monospace">πρώτως</span> discussed above breaks midword and so spans two Bekker

                  TLG numbers are structured upon principles of practicality, not a consistent
                  domain or data model. The goal of the TLG has been to put all of ancient Greek
                  literature into a convenient, simple numbering scheme. Some inconsistency has been
                  allowed in the taxonomy to minimize confusion and duplication. The end result is a
                  useful key for text retrieval but not a FRBR-like model, which the architects of
                  TLG never intended to provide. In fact, TLG violates key FRBR principles. A full
                  TLG number might point not to a work (as defined in FRBR) but to an expression, a
                  manifestation, or an item, sometimes many of them at once (see any TLG number
                  assigned the title <cite class="title">fragmenta</cite>, which collect assorted texts from
                  known but otherwise lost works). A work or an expression could have multiple TLG
                  numbers (see, e.g., Irenaeus, author 1447). Some TLG numbers refer to texts that,
                  according to FRBR's definitions might be preferably treated as works of other
                  languages (e.g., the books of the Septuagint). Comparable communities using Greek
                  texts that overlap with TLG's catalog may classify ancient or medieval Greek works
                  in a way incommensurate to TLG numbers. See, for example, the Dumbarton Oaks
                  Hagiography Database
                  (<a class="ref" href="http://www.doaks.org/research/byzantine/resources/hagiography-database" onclick="window.open('http://www.doaks.org/research/byzantine/resources/hagiography-database'); return false">http://www.doaks.org/research/byzantine/resources/hagiography-database</a>),
                     e.g.,
                  the <cite class="title italic">Life of Theophanes the Confessor</cite> (which
                  corresponds only roughly to TLG 3153); Euodius's version of
                  the <cite class="title italic">42
                        Martyrs of Amorion</cite> (largely based on TLG 3083.007 but
                  incorporating readings from TLG 5098.003); and about nineteen lives that are
                  culled from individual works collected in an edition classified singly under TLG
                  4411. None of the observations in this note should taken as a criticism of the
                  TLG. I mean only to show that it is impossible to rely on a registry system such
                  as TLG if one needs to follow a consistent domain model of texts. </div><div class="endnote" id="d978e464"><span class="noteRef">[16]</span>The third segment, called <em class="term">version</em>, corresponds to

                  (RFC 2141) all URNs are restricted to the twenty-six Latin letters (upper
                  U+0041..005A and lower U+0061..007B, which cannot be treated as equivalent) plus
                  the numerals and nineteen punctuation signs (some of which are reserved). It is
                  unclear what provision will be made for canonical numbering conventions that
                  extend outside the basic Latin alphabet or require decisions on whether uppercase
                  or lowercase Latin letters should be used. For example, Frankenberg's edition of
                  the Syriac translation of works by Evagrius of Pontus introduces canonical numbers
                  that use a manuscript-based double-Greek letter system, e.g., <span class="monospace">fol.
                     2bα</span> to refer to the part in his edition that corresponds to folio 2,
                  verso, 1st column of the manuscript he used. Of course this can be converted to a
                  CTS URN scheme, but neither an editor nor a researcher will be able to predict
                  whether such a number should be rendered <span class="monospace">2b1</span>, <span class="monospace">2ba</span>,

                  that the WEMI model presupposes a kind of Platonism, and that following an
                  Aristotelian approach (his preference), "turning the model upside down — flipping
                  WEMI to IMEW — will make the model easier to understand and to

                  FRBR listserv, 2003-11-18,11:29. Under this approach to FRBR, one begins with
                  written artefacts and tries to extrapolate types and archetypes, much as literary

                  FRBR 3.3: "The structure of the model, however, permits us to
                     represent aggregate and component entities in the same way as we would
                     represent entities that are viewed as integral units. That is to say that from
                     a logical perspective the entity work, for example, may represent an aggregate
                     of individual works brought together by an editor or compiler in the form of an
                     anthology, a set of individual monographs brought together by a publisher to
                     form a series, or a collection of private papers organized by an archive as a
                     single fond. By the same token, the entity work may represent an intellectually
                     or artistically discrete component of a larger work, such as a chapter of a
                     report, a segment of a map, an article in a journal, etc. For the purposes of
                     the model, entities at the aggregate or component level operate in the same way
                     as entities at the integral unit level; they are defined in the same terms,
                     they share the same characteristics, and they are related to one another in the
                     same way as entities at the integral unit level." Further work on aggregates is
