    open-endedness and incompletion as inherent qualities of digital work. But a scholarly publisher
    undertaking preparation and sale of digital objects cannot altogether dispense with traditional
    notions of deadlines and completion if those publications are to enter the dual marketplaces of
    peer review and institutional purchase. The Electronic Imprint of the University of Virginia
    Press was funded in 2001 with the goal of bringing born-digital scholarly projects under the
    aegis of the same review and marketing system that applies to books. In this article I describe
    how we defined the criteria for "done-ness" in creating two very different projects, a
    born-digital edition of Herman Melville’s <cite class="title italic">Typee</cite> manuscript and a conversion of
    the letterpress <cite class="title italic">Papers of George Washington</cite> into a digital edition. Our
    experience suggests that it is possible to categorize different genres of digital creations
    based on the extent to which intrinsic criteria for “done-ness” can be applied to them, and that
    decisions about completeness are always subject to extrinsic factors as well, such as budgetary
    constraints and the pressures created by competition and the evolution of standards.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Some History of Terms</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Viewed from the perspective of 
someone who works for a university press, the 
semantics of the term "done" as 
applied to digital objects is rather curious. 
From our point of view, it's generally a good 
thing for a scholarly publication to be 
"done": review copies can be sent 
out, books can be shipped to distributors, and 
budgets perhaps even met. Traditional publication 
in the scholarly publishing world has always 
meant the implicit guarantee that a work is the 
end product of a rigorous process of peer review, 
revision, copyediting, design, and proofreading 
shared institutionally by author, press boards, 
outside scholars, and in-house staff. When a book 
or journal issue is "done" it is a 
source of pride and satisfaction for everyone 
concerned.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The case seems to be different 
with digital objects. The claim that a digital 
project or publication is "done" 
may be met with suspicion. What do you mean, your 
Web-thing is finished? Since it's nonlinear, 
how do you know where it starts or ends? Won't 
there always be more features or links you can 
add? If your Web-thing is  so much like an 
old-fashioned codex book that you can call it 
"done", does it really belong 
online in the first place? This suspicion has a 
history. Theoretical discussion of projects in 
the digital humanities has, since the 1990s, 
suffered from semantic slippage between two 
related but nonidentical pairs of contradictory 
terms: on the one hand, "open" 
versus "closed"; on the other 
hand, "complete" versus 
"incomplete" (or 
"unfinished" versus 
"done", etc.). The tendency has 
been to merge these two sets into a single pair, 
then to valorize the first pair of terms and to 
demonize the second.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">One of the more polished articles on 
Wikipedia these days, ironically, 
is on the topic "Unfinished Work"; it 
discusses incomplete works in various domains 
from literature and music through architecture to 
software. On the article's discussion page, the 
first thing we find is some amused perplexity 
about the label's applicability to the very 
source it appears in <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#wiki2007">#wiki2007</a></span>:</div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000039/resources/images/figure01.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000039/resources/images/figure01.png" alt="Screen shot of the quoted &#xA;             discussion from Wikipedia"/></a></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">It is a familiar conundrum about the 
nature of digital texts. Obviously, a formally 
defined text like a sonnet can be recognized as 
complete or incomplete; it's the difference 
between a well-wrought urn and a pot whose clay 
is still wet. But can a nonlinear, extensible, 
text ever be said to be finished? Is it by 
definition unfinished, or is the opposition 
"finished/unfinished" just plain inapplicable 
to open-ended texts?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">These are theoretical questions I'm 
not in a position to answer, but I would submit 
that early in the 1990s the postmodern admiration 
of the "open-ended" at the expense of the 
"closed" somehow got turned into a 
celebration of the "unfinished" 
and a suspicion of the "done," and 
that this transmutation may have been one of the 
things that delayed the entrance of digital 
scholarship into the traditional system of 
peer-reviewed academic publication.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Consider these assertions from George 
Landow and Paul Delany's 1991 essay 
"Hypertext, Hypermedia and Literary Studies: 
The State of the Art":
          <blockquote><p>Particularly 
inapplicable [to hypertext] are the notions of 
textual "completion" and of a 
"finished" product. Hypertext 
materials are by definition open-ended, 
expandable, and incomplete. If one put a work 
conventionally considered complete, such as the 
<cite class="title italic">Encyclopedia Britannica</cite>, into a 
hypertext format, it would immediately become 
"incomplete." [<a class="ref" href="#landow1991">Landow and Delany 1991</a>, 13]</p></blockquote>
          A clever reader might object that even 
in print the <cite class="title italic">Encyclopedia 
Britannica</cite> is always incomplete: 
like any reference work, it is constantly being 
updated and reissued. So when Landow revises this 
particular passage for his 1992 book 
<cite class="title">Hypertext</cite>, he makes the claim 
even more radical by making a single change to 
the second sentence to replace the encyclopedia 
with a work of literature:
             <blockquote><p>Hypertextual 
materials, which by definition are open-ended, 
expandable, and incomplete call such notions into 
question. If one put a work conventionally 
considered complete, such as 
<cite class="title italic">Ulysses</cite>, into a hypertext format, 
it would immediately become 
"incomplete." [<a class="ref" href="#landow1992">Landow 1992</a>, 59]</p></blockquote>
             Landow is now claiming that even a 
recognizably closed, well-wrought modernist text 
becomes both open and unfinished when put online. 
And he ends his 1992 discussion of completion by 
citing Derrida to the effect that "a form of textuality that goes 
beyond print 'forces us to extend...the 
dominant notion of a "text"'," so that 
it "is henceforth no longer a 
finished corpus of writing, some content enclosed 
in a book or its margins but a differential 
network, a fabric of traces referring endlessly 
to something other than itself, to other 
differential traces" [<a class="ref" href="#landow1992">Landow 1992</a>, 59].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Julia Flanders has observed in a 
memorable phrase that the digital humanities have 
sometimes suffered from "a culture of the 
perpetual prototype" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#flanders2007">#flanders2007</a></span>, and identified some 
plausible economic and institutional causes. To 
them I think we can add the theoretical 
conflation of the digital with 
<span class="foreign i">différance</span>. After all, what 
was the postmodern project if not a cult of the 
perpetual prototype?</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Rotunda: A Scholarly Digital Imprint</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">My organization, the Electronic 
Imprint of the University of Virginia Press, was 
established in 2001 to test the proposition that 
instances of digital scholarship <em class="emph">can</em> 
be bounded, completed, and presented for review, 
sale, and academic consumption in much the way 
journals and monographs had been for decades. We 
were grant funded, with support from the 
University and the Mellon Foundation awarded to a 
proposal co-written by the Press and John 
Unsworth, who was then head of the <a class="ref" href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/" onclick="window.open('http://www.iath.virginia.edu/'); return false">Institute 
for Advanced Technology</a> (IATH) at Virginia. 
We became fully staffed in late 2002, and two 
years later released our first publication, a 
born-digital edition of Dolley Madison's 
correspondence, under our new imprint name of 
"Rotunda." Since then we have 
expanded to a total of seven publications in two 
separate collections: nineteenth-century 
literature and culture, and the American Founding 
Era. Our main focus for the next few years will 
be creating fully-featured digital versions of 
the papers of American presidents and other 
Founding Era figures that began as multivolume 
(and often still ongoing) print editions, joining 
our <cite class="title italic">Papers of George Washington Digital 
Edition</cite> (<cite class="title italic">PGWDE</cite>), which was 
released in February 2007.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">The underlying data format of all of 
our Rotunda publications is XML, tagged according 
to the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative 
(TEI), plus accompanying digitized graphical 
material. Unlike many other university presses 
with digital projects, we outsource none of our 
technical work except for graphic Web design; our 
markup specifications, stylesheets for file 
transformation, and programming for Web delivery 
(mostly coded in XQuery using <a class="ref" href="http://www.marklogic.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.marklogic.com/'); return false">MarkLogic 
Server</a> as the back-end platform) are all 
done in-house by several programmers and 
technical editors.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Born-digital Rotunda publications go 
through the same steps that our books go through: 
approval by a Press committee and then the Press 
Board after reports from external reviewers; 
signing of a contract complete with royalty 
agreements; sharing of "review 
copies" (in the form of password access) 
with librarians and academic reviewers. Digital 
editions such as <cite class="title italic">PGWDE</cite> that are 
based on existing print series are produced in 
close collaboration with the scholarly 
communities (historians and documentary editors) 
who create and use the letterpress volumes. 
Clearly all parties to our process of publication 
and sale are implicitly agreeing to bracket the 
theoretical issue of when or whether a digital 
work is ever "done" by applying a 
socioeconomic definition: it is 
"done" when the Press is prepared 
to offer it for purchase and customers are 
prepared to buy it.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">I turn now to two very dissimilar 
examples of our 
publications — <cite class="title italic">PGWDE</cite> and an

decisions we made about what we could or 
couldn't include in the finished work; when we 
counted each as "done" for initial 
release; and to what extent we consider the 
published release genuinely complete or part of a 
work still in progress.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Melville's <cite class="title italic">Typee</cite>: A Fluid-Text Edition</h1><div id="figure02" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000039/resources/images/figure02.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000039/resources/images/figure02.png" alt="Splash page of Rotunda &#xA;&#34;Typee&#34; edited by John Bryant"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div><cite class="title italic">Typee</cite> splash page</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">John Bryant's edition of a portion 
of Herman Melville's novel <cite class="title italic">Typee</cite> 
was first envisioned and prototyped years before 
Rotunda came into existence. Bryant has been 
editing Melville's texts for two decades, and 
has long felt that any critical edition of a text 
that survives in more than a single version needs 
to be faithful to its evolutionary history; it 
should be what he calls a 
"fluid-text" edition. Because a 
fluid-text edition needs to capture a dynamic 
process, a computer-based format is a natural 
fit, and he began imagining one for Melville as 
early as the 1980s (personal communication).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">The textual history of 
<cite class="title italic">Typee</cite> is fairly complicated. The 
only surviving manuscript fragment covers about 
three chapters of the published novel. It 
contains a multitude of cancellations, erasures, 
and additions by Melville, both in ink from the 
time of first composition and in pencil from 
later stages of revision and proofreading <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>.

             We know that Melville made changes in 
proof before the first English edition was 
issued, and that the first American edition 
contained still more changes, some requested by 
Melville, others made by the publisher probably 
without the author's assent. Bryant's goal 
for a digital fluid-text edition was to capture 
all of these stages and to allow the reader to 
follow the sequence of composition and the 
editor's narrative reconstruction of that 
sequence, zooming in and out to any point in 
manuscript time and space during the entire 
period from initial composition through the 
published editions.</div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Development of the Edition</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Bryant was not himself a 
programmer or XML specialist, but he did have 
ideas about what a computer edition might look 
like, and created detailed storyboards before any 
actual programming work began. Although these 
were necessarily static, they used frame- and 
button-like boxes to suggest how a screen 
presentation might respond dynamically to reader 
choices (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). In 1998 he 
was named an IATH <a class="ref" href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/other_fellows.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.iath.virginia.edu/other_fellows.html'); return false">Visting

its adaptation to a fully-featured online format

value to the print edition required a preliminary

the basic textual unit is the single document, 
always accompanied at a minimum by 
bibliographical information and usually by 
editorial annotation, and sometimes by 
translations, enclosed documents, or other 
ancillary material. (Diaries and journals are a 
special case: depending on how chronologically 
structured they are, the basic textual unit may 
be the single-day entry, the single-month entry, 
or a longer narrative.) Besides the original text 
and editorial material, documents contain 
metadata, cross-references, abbreviations and 
other special features that are represented using 
a variety of editorial and typographical 
conventions, as highlighted in the facsimile of the 
original letterpress version of a letter from 
William Livingston to George Washington (shown <a href="#figure11">below</a>). Beyond 
the document level, most volumes contain 
scholarly apparatuses (lists of abbreviations and 
bibliographic expansions of short-title 
references), editorial and historical 
introductions, and a detailed index of all proper 
names and hundreds of topic categories. The 
translation of all of these print conventions

Yes and no. It is a stable release version with 
some remaining imperfections, but there's a lot 
more we plan to do with it, even apart from 
adding content as we digitize new volumes after 
they appear in print. We've recently met with 
the PGW staff to agree on a list of priorities 
for enhancement. The tasks fall into three 
general categories:
                <ol class="list"><li class="item">Optimization of existing 
features. Examples: improving search speed and 
index retrieval; rewriting the search parser to 
make it more Google-like and to include more 
boolean operators.
          </li><li class="item">New features. Add an 
"advanced search" 
page that will allow users to search by document 
features or language, for example. We'll add 
full-text searching on the index. Farther down 
the road may be "keeping up with the 
Joneses" enhancements, like enabling the 
user to save a personal workspace containing 
bookmarked documents and search result sets as 
the <a class="ref" href="http://edwards.yale.edu/archive/" onclick="window.open('http://edwards.yale.edu/archive/'); return false">Works 
of Jonathan Edwards Online</a> at Yale has done.
          </li><li class="item">Features required by 
aggregating <cite class="title italic">PGWDE</cite> into the larger 
Founding Era collection. Over the next year we 
will be adding editions of the <cite class="title italic">Adams 
Family Papers</cite>, the <cite class="title italic">Papers of 
Thomas Jefferson</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">The 
Documentary History of the Ratification of the 
Constitution</cite>. In order to build an 
extensible framework, we have already begun a 
thorough rewrite of our delivery code and 
encoding specifications so that our publication 
system will scale gracefully as more publications 
are added.</li></ol>
                But it is impossible for us to 
project all of the enhancements that may become 
desirable or possible in the future. We are in a 
position not too different, really, from that of 
the editors who began planning American 
documentary historical editions beginning in the 
1950s. They of course knew that their completed 
volumes would eventually need to be supplemented 
and corrected as new documents and historical 
information emerged. What they couldn't 
envision was a time, our own, when scholarship 
that exists only in print is increasingly seen as 
<span class="hi italic">ipso facto</span> lacking an 
essential quality. Likewise, we can really only 
guess at what new features advancing technology 
may make possible. For instance, we have often 
wished we had time and funding to add rich XML 
tagging for personal and place names (beyond the 
author/recipient identifications in existing 
metadata), and assumed that this would require a 
major commitment of human labor. But it's not 
impossible that advances in automated <a class="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/named_entity_recognition" onclick="window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/named_entity_recognition'); return false">named 
entity recognition</a> will enable us in a 
not-too-distant future to pipe 
<cite class="title italic">PGWDE</cite> through a program that will 
reliably recognize and tag those names and link 
them to, say, genealogical databases or a 
GIS-based interface like Google Earth.

from the Rotunda Experience</h1><div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p class="quote">Ask any developer out there if 
a program is ever finished and they'll tell you, 
"No, of course not, I still need to...". But, 
ask any developer out there if the program is 
<em class="emph">almost</em> finished and, assuming that 
the development cycle has progressed far enough 
along, their answer will invariably be, "Yes, 
all I have to do is...". They may even quantify 
it: "80% complete". Ask them a couple of 
days, weeks, months (depending on the magnitude 
of the project) later and you will get a similar 
response, but with a different percentage, say 
90%. And so forth…but never 100%. (<a class="ref" href="http://quay.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/never-finished/" onclick="window.open('http://quay.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/never-finished/'); return false">"Never Finished; or Zeno's Paradox 
as an Analog to Software Development"</a>)</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">It is entirely possible to define 
"done-ness" for computer software 
in such a way that no instantiation of a software 
project can ever satisfy the definition. For 
example, suppose we stipulate that:
          <blockquote><p>A program is complete and 
can be distributed when it (1) satisfies all 
initial design requirements, (2) is known to run 
100% bug-free under all potential conditions of 
use, and (3) incorporates state-of-the-art 
programming techniques and tools at the time of 
distribution to offer the user an optimal mix of 
powerful features and ease of use.</p></blockquote>
           The second and third criteria entail 
that none but the simplest programs could ever 
count as complete. To claim "my program is 
bug-free because I have found no bugs in it" 
is <span class="foreign i">argumentum ad ignorantiam</span>; 
that you haven't found any doesn't mean they 
aren't there. And criterion 3 turns done-ness 
into a Red Queen's race, since the state of the 
art is constantly advancing, and at release time 
most complex software projects are already 
"belated" relative to the cutting 
edge of technology. To the extent that digital 
publications count as software projects, they too 
would fail ever to count as finished under such a 
definition.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">The adjective "simplest" in the 
preceding paragraph hints at a way around the 
paradox. If my goal is to write a "hello

the one-line program <blockquote><p><span class="monospace">print "Hello 
World!\n";</span></p></blockquote> I can confidently say 
I'm done. If my task is to write a new 
operating system, it's another matter. As a 
rule, the more <span class="hi italic">complex</span> a 
task is, the less susceptible it is of being 
judged finished by any set of formal criteria. 
Contrast these two assignments:
             <ol class="list"><li class="item">Create a crop circle in the

             The first project is done once 
you've made a single circuit while tromping 
down wheat at the end of a 20m tether. The second 
project is done when you've created as accurate 
a representation as your time and skill allow. 
Tracing a coastline is a problem in fractal 
geometry for which completeness will always be 
relative. In a sense, it is a formal property of 
project 2 that it is done only when you decide it 
is done. To put it another way, intrinsic 
criteria are used in both cases to determine when 
the project qualifies as finished, but as project 
2 is formally undecidable (embodying the Turing 
halting problem that Matt Kirschenbaum mentions 
in his introduction), extrinsic criteria are also 
required to make the determination.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">The digital publications that we have

"coastline" we needed to reproduce 
was, like that of Britain, a pre-existing and 
well-defined object, the fifty-two volumes of the 
print edition. To have omitted a volume would 
have been as clear a sign of incompleteness as 
leaving Cornwall out of the crop circle. But 
decisions about the richness of our feature set 
were very much a matter of "how far to 
trace", and in the end were dictated by our 
available time and skill (and budget). If our 
experience is representative, deciding when to 
call a digital project "done" usually requires a

and external factors.</div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Intrinsic Criteria</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">Intrinsic criteria are formalist:

continuum from objects like a monograph (or a 
lyric poem) that can be judged to possess organic 
unity, to ones like a collaborative virtual world

familiar in scholarly publishing, hence the most 
fully integrated into the tenure-and-review 
system. Bryant's <cite class="title italic">Typee</cite> 
essentially falls into this category. Probably 
owing to the influence of online publishing, 
Category 2 objects are becoming more familiar: 
online preprints are accredited scholarly 
communications in a growing number of 
disciplines, and cutting-edge book publishers 
like O'Reilly with their <a class="ref" href="http://www.oreilly.com/roughcuts/" onclick="window.open('http://www.oreilly.com/roughcuts/'); return false">Rough 
Cuts</a> series of early-access PDF are 
adopting a "versioned" model of 
publication.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">Category 3 objects are also 
familiar from the print world, where they 
represent the one kind of open-endedness that 
does not upset traditional notions about 
scholarly authority. The <cite class="title italic">Oxford English 
Dictionary</cite> is a good example. It has been 
supplemented, transformed, and extended many 
times since the first fascicles were issued in 
1884. Yet each discrete stage of publication was 
accepted by the academic community as 
authoritative for its moment. It is no accident 
that this category has translated easily to 
digital format: the only essential difference 
between the print and online <cite class="title italic">OED</cite> 
is that the latter is updated far more often.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Category 4 is the one to which the 
term "done" seems the most 
inapplicable. Its characteristic objects are more 
like processes than products, and it is difficult 
to think of genuine analogues in the print world 
outside the realm of experimental literature of 
the Oulipo variety. A publication like 
<cite class="title">Wikipedia</cite> can perhaps be seen as a 
special case of Category 3 in which discrete 
stages succeed each other with extreme rapidity, 
but a virtual world like <a class="ref" href="http://secondlife.com/" onclick="window.open('http://secondlife.com/'); return false"><cite class="title">Second 
Life</cite></a> exists in such constant motion 
that it requires something akin to calculus for 
adequate description. Unsurprisingly, Category 4 
is the form of digital creation least amenable to 
naturalization in the academic reward system or 
the scholarly publishing marketplace.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Extrinsic Factors</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">For a scholarly publisher, 
intrinsic criteria of done-ness are important but 
are often trumped by extrinsic factors. The 
judgement that a book manuscript is done and 
ready for press requires an agreement among 
author, acquiring editor, external reviewers, and 
the manuscript editorial and production 
departments that is based largely on its formal 
content. But completely extrinsic factors such as 
the desire to include the book in a particular 
season's list will often lead a press to veto 
an author's wish to continue tinkering with a 
manuscript. Similarly, an author may not consider 
a monograph on Chinese art formally complete 
without the inclusion of several dozen full-page 
color reproductions on glossy inserts, but a 
publisher may omit them for the wholly extrinsic 
reason that the profit-and-loss sheet doesn't 
budget for them. Once a book is in print, 
decisions about its subsequent 
"done-ness" (i.e., whether to 
reprint, revise, issue in paperback, etc.) are 
based almost entirely on economic factors. In the 
case of digital publications, I will suggest, 
extrinsic factors become important at an earlier 
stage and are proportionately more important at 
every stage of composition and publication.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">The following list of extrinsic 
factors is not meant to be exhaustive; they are 
the ones that have been most prominent in 
Rotunda's experience.</div><div class="ptext"><dl><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Economic constraints</span>Two maxims apply: <em class="emph">(1) 
if a digital publication doesn't sell, it's 
"done"; (2) if the projected cost 
of upgrade exceeds projected revenue, it's 
"done"</em>. (For freely 
distributed projects, substitute "when no more 
grant funding or volunteer time is available, 
it's done.") <br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Competition</span>Maxim: <em class="emph">when your 
competition is adding features to its product, 
they can render your finished product 
"incomplete."</em> In the print 
world, this phenomenon is familiar in textbook 
and reference publishing. In the digital world, 
it is absolutely pervasive. No online 
publication, free or for sale, can afford 
long-term stasis when the peer publications it is 
compared with are adding bells and whistles (a 
list that would include, as of 2008, things like 
Ajax-powered form fields, tag clusters, user 
reviews and personal workspaces, page previews on 
mouseover, selectable themes or 
"skins" . . .) In the 
prestige economy as in the market economy, 
keeping up with the Joneses is not optional.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Standards evolution</span>Maxim: <em class="emph">even absent 
competition, the evolution of standards can make 
a finished project 
"incomplete."</em> This is 
primarily a matter of adhering to best practices, 
though not entirely free from the 
keeping-up-with-the-Joneses factor. Certainly if 
your academic discipline adopts a new format for 
metadata, or your institution adds a requirement 
that Web publications meet accessibility 
guidelines, your projects need to be revised for 
conformity. In other cases, it may be a matter of 
pride to demonstrate that a project has upgraded 
to the latest standard, for example by converting 
archival XML from TEI P4 to P5 compliance, or by 
following the very latest W3C recommendation for 
XHTML or CSS.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Aggregation</span>Maxim: <em class="emph">a stand-alone 
publication will probably become 
"incomplete" when it is aggregated 
with other material.</em> In Rotunda's 
experience, it is inevitable that the user 
interface and back-end coding one develops for a 
single digital project will need to be 
substantially revised once a second project is 
added and meant to interoperate with the first. 
(As a case in point, it would require major 
effort to get our first publication, the <a class="ref" href="http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu:8080/dmde/" onclick="window.open('http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu:8080/dmde/'); return false"><cite class="title italic">Dolley 
Madison Digital Edition</cite></a>, seamlessly 
integrated with <cite class="title italic">PGWDE</cite>, as the 
back-end programming and underlying XML data 
formats of the two publications are quite 
different.)<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Technological change</span>Maxim: <em class="emph">new technology 
<span class="hi bold">will</span> make your publication 
"incomplete"</em>. This goes 
almost without saying. The evolution of hardware, 
operating systems, programming languages, and Web 
standards will eventually make any online 
publication obsolete. Failure to migrate a 
digital object periodically as technical 
conditions require is the analogue of allowing a 
published book to go out of print. (In fact 
it's worse: it's like printing the book on 
high-acid-content paper with ink that fades on 
exposure to light, and <em class="emph">then</em> letting 
it go out of print.)<br/><br/></dd></dl></div></div><div id="synthesis" class="div div1"><h2 class="head">A Necessary Synthesis</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Whether you are a publisher or the 
editor of an open-access publication, allowing 
extrinsic factors to influence your decision 
about whether a digital project is done is in no 
way an admission of defeat or an abdication of 
responsibility. It is, in fact, the only way to 
avoid the form of Zeno's paradox whimsically 
propounded in the epigraph to this section. The 
progress of knowledge in the arts and sciences is 
continuous, but in order for it to happen at all, 
scholarly discourse must be distributed in the 
form of discrete objects that can be shared, read 
or viewed, responded to, assimilated, quoted, 
disputed, and revised. In the marketplace of 
ideas, it's less important how you decide when 
your piece is done than that you <em class="emph">do</em>

Kennedy's Residence at his Farm was
          injurious to the State, &amp;amp; occasioned great Clamours from the
          People in This Neighbourhood, the 
Council ordered his Attendance on the

          sent us by return of the Express three Affidavits with Copies of which

          know the Nature of that Parole (of which he has no Copy) &amp;amp;

          has taken Paroles from persons professedly Subjects of this State

Prisoner we suppose him exchangeable
