    Perhaps never. Something done is past, irrevocable, requiring nothing more
    and indeed immune from further action. The case of the Orlando Project, a
    large-scale and longstanding digital humanities undertaking, reveals an
    arbitrariness, even a fictiveness or contradictoriness, to the notion of
    completion of the project as a whole or even of its major online product.
    Digital humanities projects are considerably more prone than traditional
    humanities undertakings to riding off into the sunset until the next
    installment rather than being laid to rest. "Doneness" circulates
    discursively within a complex and evolving scholarly ecology where new
    modes of digital publication are changing our conceptions of textuality,
    at the same time that models of publication, funding, and archiving are
    rapidly changing. Within this ecology, it is instrumental and indeed
    valuable (indeed, as Matt Kirschenbaum suggests here, highly satisfying)
    to consider particular tasks and stages done, even as the capacities of
    digital media push against a sense of finality. However, careful
    interrogation of aims and ends is required to think through the relation
    of a digital project to completion, whether modular, provisional, or of
    the project as a whole.</div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Projection and Experimentality</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">In the digital humanities we often organize undertakings in terms of
      "projects", research endeavours that are probably, ideally, a
      collaborative enterprise "carefully planned to
          achieve a particular aim" (<span class="error"><a href="#oed2007">Oxford English Dictionary 2007,
              "project"</a></span>). The emphasis is on the future, on the projected outcome and
      potential of the undertaking: projects, as the cognate verb "to project"
      suggests, are future-oriented. Some — an example would be the nora Project
      [nora] — last about as long as the money from a particular grant, but
      others — the Perseus Project and the Women Writers Project are
      examples — continue over many years and multiple grant funding cycles. A
      successful project is thus not necessarily geared to realizing a
          "particular aim". Perseus as "an evolving digital
              library" (<a class="ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/" onclick="window.open('http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/'); return false">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/</a>) situates its work in the vast scale of biological time; the WWP’s
      aims are equally open-ended. These trajectories of digital humanities
      undertakings don’t pin themselves to a specific end, but carry "A planned or proposed undertaking; a scheme, a proposal; a
          purpose, an objective" (<span class="error"><a href="#oed2007">Oxford English Dictionary 2007, "project"</a></span>) 
      into the foreseeable future, with gusto. Such an orientation is actually
      at odds with the definition of a project in relation to particular aims.
      The success of these projects is not pegged on completion, but measured
      in other ways.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">So there's clearly a lot that scholars involved with such projects
      want to do without being done, particularly insofar as being undone is
      compatible with disseminating materials to others and engaging in
      scholarly dialogue about them. At root is not only, as the introduction
      here suggests, a culture of perpetual prototypes that mitigates desire
      for closure, or funding structures that poorly support the "finishing"
      process for non-commercialized projects. It is also the very
      multi-faceted nature of much digital humanities research, which so often
      straddles the divide between content development and technological
      experimentation. This interplay between traditional humanities content
      and innovative methodologies means there is always more to be done.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The Orlando Project, with its aim of "producing
      the first full scholarly history of women's writing in the British
      Isles" (<span class="error"><a href="#brown2006">Brown et al. 2006, home page</a></span>), is a
      long-term digital humanities project that is both done and yet not done.
      Unlike many electronic projects, the project held off making its major
      resource available until it was in quite a polished and complete state.
      <cite class="title italic">Orlando: Women Writers in the British Isles from
      the Beginnings to the Present</cite> was published online by Cambridge
      University Press in June 2006. It is not a collection of primary texts,
      but a massive born-digital resource in literary history amounting now to
      almost 7.7 million words in the form of 1,206 detailed and often quite
      lengthy entries on writers’ lives and writing careers, more than 13,000
      independent chronology items, and 22,000 bibliographical records. Yet
      the project is far from done: its content and technical work continue.
      This paper explores the tension between projection and completion over
      this project’s history to date as a means of considering that tension in
      relation to digital humanities research generally.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The project’s cofounders (Susan Brown, Patricia Clements, and Isobel
      Grundy) were new to digital humanities research, so our notions of
      scholarly process and completion related to conventional print
      publications. As Claire Warwick has noted, the idea of what is
      "complete" or "publication-ready" in academic culture has emerged from a
      complex set of human factors relating to such matters as the attribution
      of credit by institutions and funding structures, as well as the
      conception of what is required intellectually for a product to be done
      [<a class="ref" href="#warwick2004">Warwick 2004</a>, 368]. Such factors undoubtedly entered into how the
      Orlando Project was conceived. In our original funding application, we
      projected a single moment of completion at which the planned electronic
      history would be ready alongside several related print volumes of
      scholarship. We were fortunate to receive a Major Collaborative Research
      Initiative (MCRI) grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
      Council of Canada (SSHRC), and embarked on the project as planned. And
      then things changed.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Working at the interface between humanities research questions and
      evolving digital methods means that projections about the trajectories
      of digital humanities work are less likely to be accurate than those of
      traditional scholarship. This is not to say that any research project
      may not run into snags or unforeseen delays - instances, particularly in
      the history of earlier scholarship, include Samuel Johnson's having to
      restart his dictionary mid-stream because he realized that working with
      small slips of paper would be better than the old technology of full
      sheets - but these are less often related to the methodology per se of
      the scholarly undertaking. In the case of Orlando, the ambition and
      experimentality of what we had undertaken on the technical side had a
      radical impact on the progress of the literary work with which it was
      interdependent, both because key researcher time was involved in the
      development of the custom tagset we developed and successively refined
      as a key component of our methodological experimentation, and because we
      had to build in-house production and delivery systems from scratch in
      ways that we had not anticipated. The risk of these sorts of impacts is
      endemic to methodologically experimental research of any kind, and
      particularly relevant to digital humanities work. Such impacts don’t
      mean that the project is not pursuing its aims effectively, but they can
      have a major impact on anticipated timelines and perceptions of
      productivity, especially if the project has been articulated in relation
      to a particular aim or deliverable.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Modularity and Incrementalism</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Digital humanists therefore need to plan and sequence with care their
      deliverables, which are important not only because our work must take
      objective form to be shared with our colleagues, but also because those
      are the ways in which we are accountable to the funding bodies that make
      our often costly work possible. Given the risk-oriented nature of
      experimental research, it is strategic to promise outcomes that are both
      multiple and modular. The Orlando Project struggled for funding in later
      stages as a result, we believe, of a project design that focused on a
      single, end-loaded monumental deliverable.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The big "ta-da!" moment of publication is a very common strategy, one
      followed by the Blake Archive in 1996 with its release of <cite class="title italic">The Book of Thel</cite>, copy F, and then again in 1997
      with further fanfare when it released the first SGML version of that
      text with additional functionality for users, and in 2008 by The
      Nineteenth-Century Serials Edition, which launched all six serials with
      a splash. The "ta-da" provides both that crucial sense of satisfaction
      and progress for the participants and a landmark achievement that
      constitutes important evidence of completion of at least a phase of the
      project for funding agencies. It has drawbacks, however. Focus on an end
      deliverable can obscure interim accomplishments. The Orlando Project's
      research plan was designed to proceed through a number of stages.
      Indeed, the milestones and the mid-term review required by the MCRI
      Program are examples of the kind of official part-done marker which,
      although it may not arise organically from the research needs or
      achievements and is imposed from the outside by the bureaucratic rules
      of another entity, can nevertheless be used by researchers as a spur to
      setting and meeting meaningful interim goals. Many of those markers
      were, however, internal to the project, which meant that they didn't
      provide the same kind of objective sense of progress that comes with
      public release. Externally, and for our funding agency, what registered
      was what we had not done, rather than what we had accomplished. An
      immense online "product" such as that Orlando promised from the outset
      does well then to be balanced by some objective, interim goals. In
      addition, the launch that suits a book does run somewhat counter to the
      ongoing life of many digital projects if it leaves people thinking that
      the project itself is finished.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Other projects have made their way into the world rather differently,
      in ways suggestive of ongoing curation. The Poetess Archive, for
      instance, began as a series of rather modest web pages that have grown
      over time in both scope and sophistication, moving from HTML into XML
      with a sophisticated search interface. Editorial ventures perhaps lend
      themselves particularly well to an incremental approach. The Brown
      University Women Writers Project (<a class="ref" href="http://www.wwp.brown.edu/" onclick="window.open('http://www.wwp.brown.edu/'); return false">http://www.wwp.brown.edu</a>), for instance,
      first transcribed and encoded texts, made printouts available and
      partnered with a publishing house, and released Renaissance Women
      Online. By the time Women Writers Online was made available by
      subscription, it was clear that, although it was a major event, it was
      part of a continuing project. Just as software projects typically put
      out numbered releases, which provide the triumphant moment of
      celebration while suggesting that more is yet to come, designing
      projects to incorporate such incrementalism by way of staged releases
      that mark phases of accomplishment or a number of discrete and in some
      way publishable deliverables, seems a particularly useful way to
      structure digital projects.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">So it seems crucial to design digital humanities
      projects with a number of discrete and in some way publishable
      deliverables. Ideally, these should be modular, that is, functionally
      independent of one another. This means each has the potential for
      separate funding, can proceed on its own, and can provide a satisfying
      moment of completion. Modularity, however, suits some kinds of projects
      better than others. Both content and software systems often rely on the
      interrelation of various parts that can make it a challenge for one part
      to develop independently of the others. And even where a high degree of
      modularity is possible, modules usually need to be integrated at some
      point, so careful coordination to ensure eventual compatibility is still
      necessary, as well as an eventual convergence of module completion.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Various factors can work against modular publication. <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>’s content structure was modular in form,
      composed as it was of author entries and chronological materials. Each
      of these theoretically could have been published as soon as they were
      "done". Yet doneness there was relative: there occurred a regular effect
      whereby the production of a new entry spurred significant improvement in
      several supposedly complete ones. An iterative process developed, not
      unlike the successive stages required in traditional humanities
      research, where the gradual accretion of knowledge slowly modifies the
      researcher’s view and understanding of material. There was a strong
      sense both that the content work had to progress to a certain point of
      intellectual maturity, and that there were intellectual demands for a
      certain degree of coverage. We wouldn’t be "done", for instance, without
      having completed the materials on Virginia Woolf or George Eliot.
      Because much feminist work has resisted the establishment of a small
      canon of female writers at the expense of others, such major writers
      needed to be situated in relation to less prominent contemporaries, and
      because we rejected a separatist understanding of literary history, we
      needed to include some male and international writers. Despite the
      apparent modularity of our content, we held off publishing until we had
      1,149 entries completed. Thus, where scholarly content is concerned, a
      certain critical mass may be held necessary to establish scholarly
      confidence in the quality of a resources. Whether that threshold
      constitutes a single digital object, such as an edited text, or
      thousands of objects will vary. But it can work against a modular
      approach. Further revision is of course possible: the <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> entries on Eliot and Woolf continue to be
      extended or revised at almost every update. In this sense, the digital
      done with its easy accommodation of incrementation is infinitely
      preferable to the printed done. But any project wishing to publish in
      stages will have to decide its initial content threshold according to
      the particular research goals of the project, criteria in the field for
      scholarly reliability, and user expectations.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Technical considerations constitute a further challenge to modular
      publishing, since a prototype is one thing and a debugged,
      multiple-browser-supporting, polished publication vehicle is
      another. We know that users are very easily put off by frustration in
      the use of new resources or tools, so publishing components that are
      unstable or poorly integrated may have a seriously negative impact. In
      the case of <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>, our customized tagset
      required us to build a fairly complex XML delivery system, a task we had
      not anticipated in the mid-90s when TEI-SGML was emerging as a standard
      and XML was just over the horizon. Only a quite finished interface, we
      felt, stood a chance of convincing our core users from the
      technologically-resistant field of literary studies of the strengths of
      the markup into which the project had invested so much intellectual
      labour. <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> offers users a range of
      affordances beyond that of looking up specific writers’ entries, as the
      menu bar on the home page as it was at initial release (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>)
      makes clear. These extend to searching in quite precise ways on the more
      than 2 million semantic tags embedded in its literary-historical prose.
      To make the system’s unique strengths apparent, we again needed a
      critical mass of materials to populate search results and showcase
      innovative features — such as the links screens that provide
      semantically-categorized access to mentions of writers across the
      textbase (see <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000040/resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/2/000040/resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt="Screen shot showing Orlando home page"/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div><cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> home page,

      electronic from the print publication, so that the former stands alone
      initially. Yet the textbase was published relatively complete. Thus,
      while structuring projects modularly is highly desirable for a range of
      reasons, truly modular publication may present challenges with respect
      to audiences from beyond the digital humanities community. Research
      domain, project conceptualization, and publication options are all crucial
      determinants of how "done" will be defined for a particular project.
      Project members need to arrive at a shared understanding of what
      constitutes an acceptable degree of intellectual maturity, critical mass
      of content, and technological finish at initial publication. This is
      particularly important since projects often seem to be judged by both
      funders and traditional humanities users according to their state at
      first release, as if they were a book. Once a first set of material is
      released, staged publication — such as the addition of new components,
      functionalities, or alternative interfaces — and incrementation — such as
      additions to or enhancement of existing content — become easier. However,
      in project planning, it seems strategically important for researchers to
      stress to funders the value of interim publications and subprojects, and
      generally not to allow a major deliverable to swallow up the identity of
      a project as a whole, so that the perception that the former is "done"
      does not carry with it a sense that the latter is also finished. Release
      or version numbers, or other ways of flagging the open-endedness of an
      electronic publication may be helpful in this regard.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Digital Textuality and Publication</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Digital projects, if they aim to move beyond prototypes and court a

      sense finished.<a class="noteRef" href="#d31256e355">[1]</a> We need to think through with our funding agencies not
      only how to sustain digital publications over the long haul, but also
      how to help projects with hugely valuable content leap that imposing
      hurdle from prototype to polished publication. At the same time,
      digitally published may not mean "done" in several respects.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Published is traditionally done, as David Sewell argues in his essay
      in this cluster. But published electronic projects don’t get put on a
      shelf in a library. Being unconstrained by print materiality reinforces
      the arbitrariness of deciding that something is done in the sense of
      "complete", which is defined in the <cite class="title italic">Oxford English
      Dictionary</cite> as "Having all its parts or
      members; comprising the full number or amount; embracing all the
      requisite items, details, topics, etc.; entire, full." Published
      may mean (provisionally) done without meaning complete, and there is of
      course a long tradition of encyclopedic print publications issuing a
      series of updates or supplements. Digital publication allows us to
      define done in terms of the kind of intrinsic completeness suggested by
      the <cite class="title italic">OED</cite> rather than because we’ve reached
      an arbitrary limit (a deadline, a word length) related to print
      processes. In this sense, <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>, though
      published, remains incomplete. Though all the items we considered
      requisite for initial publication are there, we remain aware of those
      figures, topics, approaches, and perspectives that demand inclusion in a
      "full" history of women’s writing in the British Isles. Our contract
      with our publisher recognises the provisionality of our completion by
      stipulating for updates, as well as in the plan for the volumes of
      discursive history. We’ve increased and enhanced both content and
      functionality semi-annually since publication.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">The "done" founded on digital publication is fragile in another sense
      because of the rapidity of technological change. The stability of book
      technology means that a book can be done and put to rest by both authors
      and publishers: even if it goes out of print, so long as copies endure
      in libraries they can continue to be used in perpetuity. But digital
      publications require more active support. Even if no technological
      enhancements are desired, for an electronic text to remain usable, it
      has to be stored somewhere in a form that is accessible to evolving
      technologies. This means it requires more active curation: even a quite
      straightforward web publication becomes unusable if it can’t keep pace
      with browser releases. A new version of a project produced to migrate
      with current standards and practices is different from a second print
      edition in a number of respects. While both respond to a perception of
      continued demand for the product, the electronic migration is required
      to keep the resource accessible at all, and it does not supplement the
      first edition, which in the case of print will persist, but materially
      speaking supercedes or replaces it. This means that updates to
      electronic publications, while having a decided formal edge over errata slips or supplemental volumes, bear the
      additional burden of keeping the text in circulation. Being done with a
      digital publication may mean that the work disappears entirely from
      use.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">The potential evanescence of a project’s digital output creates
      pressures on the scholar, team, or publisher to keep it available. The
      academic community is still groping to discover how best to sustain
      digital publications over the long term. In the meantime, to meet even
      modest needs for technical migration and to keep content current,
      projects must continue to find funding, which can be challenging if a
      project is perceived as done as a result of publication. The Orlando
      Project, as part of its strategy of sustainability, licensed the
      textbase to the University of Alberta, and the University in turn
      sub-licensed it to Cambridge University Press. This arrangement created
      a revenue stream to help support the project’s preparations for
      publication and its updates and ongoing activities. It also sustains
      Orlando’s identity at its home institution and gives a broader
      constituency than the team members an interest in the project’s success.
      This is important because, although like other ongoing projects Orlando
      has been able to obtain research funding for new initiatives,
      maintenance funding is a major challenge.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Part of the problem is in how we conceive of digital publications.
      Many ongoing digital publications should be understood by analogy with
      journals, for whom "done" can be applied to particular issues but not to
      the relevant research area. Continuing work despite previous publication
      is then part of the mandate, rather than the extraordinary burden it
      would seem in comparison with a book. The analogy applies only in part,
      because of course the entire text of a digital publication is fluid and
      subject to ongoing revision as that of a print journal is not. But it
      helps conceive more appropriately what "done" might mean for a lot of
      digital projects, with their capacity to increment and to migrate both
      technologically and with their field, just as does the analogy of the
      library for the Perseus Project.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Indeed, from a theoretical perspective, an electronic publication
      will arguably never be "done" precisely because of the nature of
      electronic textuality. Print texts are susceptible (as indeed were
      manuscripts and printed texts) to all sorts of repurposing, from reissue
      through quotation and anthologizing, to reprinting or incorporating in
      works of graphic art. In a digital environment, this aspect of
      textuality is greatly intensified by the ease with which one can
      "sample" texts, and the ability to separate content from presentation in
      digital formats means that entire works can be readily reformed or
      deformed. To take a familiar digital activity as an example, textual
      editing in an electronic environment must be reconceived as involving
      several different modes of editing. A TEI-conformant XML edition can
      form the basis of other quite divergent editions, such as an
      intentionalist rather than a genetic or "fluid-text" edition such as the
      Rotunda Press edition of Melville’s <cite class="title italic">Typee</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#bryant2006">Bryant 2006</a>]. Scholars will increasingly be able to build on existing
      electronic texts, restructuring or adding to them, or recombining them
      with new content to produce new texts. In a radical extension of earlier
      forms of textuality, the possibility that an electronic text will
      continue to morph, be reproduced, and live on in ways quite unforeseen
      by its producers makes "done" to an extent always provisional.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Archives</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">The fact that electronic texts are not static leads to the thorny
      issue of archiving them, surely a marker of some kind of doneness. For
      although the "digital archive" is used loosely to refer to the total
      volume of material available in digital form, attempting to do for
      digital culture what government, university, museums, and other
      organized archives have done for print culture — preserve records of the
      past so as to allow others to access it in the future, including
      selection, arrangement, conservation, cataloguing — is a major challenge.
      Even the term "archive" may suggest misleading parallels between older
      archival practices and what is possible or appropriate for digital
      materials. People deposit books, personal papers, or theses in an
      archive, where they remain, unchanged, unless a medium like acid paper
      demands conservation, for future generations to consult. That may be
      possible for some resources such as collections of static web pages, as
      recorded by the Internet Archive, but for dynamic digital resources such
      as the Orlando Project, archiving even a substantial set of web pages
      would be only the tip of the iceberg. The Orlando Project has committed
      to archiving with the University of Alberta Library, which currently
      entails a fairly well-defined set of practices designed to ensure
      long-term survival of the data. However, current practices are unlikely
      to be able to document either the dynamic text or the research process,
      which was an experiment in large-scale humanities research and
      computing. We can archive our internal materials, such as meeting
      minutes, policy documents, and so on. We have an archive of all past
      versions of the documents that make up the textbase, and of past
      versions of the delivery system (code and content), so that what it
      looked like in the past is recoverable. But particular versions will
      only be recoverable as we have machines that run the browsers and the
      coding behind them. We need as a community to grapple further with the
      question of how to archive dynamic resources.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">Funding bodies such as SSHRC have policies requiring the public
      archiving of data, even though many researchers are unaware of this
      requirement and despite the fact that the country lacks the standards
      and indeed the facilities to permanently archive digital material
      <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#macdonald">#macdonald</a></span>. The notice one frequently encounters accessing materials
      through the Library and Archives Canada Electronic Collection is a
      sobering reminder of what may be lost: "You are viewing a document
      archived by Library and Archives Canada. Please note, information may be
      out of date and some functionality lost"[<a class="ref" href="#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a>]. We anticipate
      out-of-date information in an archive, of course, but if considerable
      functionality is lost, a digital artifact can hardly be said to have
      been archived successfully. And this site is devoted to archiving just
      "monographs and periodicals" rather than more complex artifacts.
      Archiving an experimental digital project must include the daunting task
      of somehow preserving not just text but code and functionality, either
      by maintaining systems on which they can run or migrating them to newer
      ones. If not, the project will be not done but done for.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Evading the Archive</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">But archiving alone would represent a form of doneness that many
      digital projects hardly seek. We want <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> to be up and running, to be alive and
      evolving, being updated and used far into the future. Such longevity in
      more than an archived state has major implications in terms of
      resources. Lack of people, time, or funding has consigned more than one
      project involuntarily to becoming a static tribute to its former
      activity. The reasons for this include people moving on, intellectually
      or institutionally, without taking their projects along with them, or
      people using electronic media to disseminate without particularly
      desiring to exploit their potential for continual updating, but even
      where the will to continue persists, inadequate funding mechanisms for
      sustainability may make it impossible. This is a shame, since, as we
      have argued here, in the case of <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite>
      and many other digital publications not only does there remain the
      potential to enrich the contents, but the first iteration often merely
      begins to tap the potential of the project’s data architecture and
      potential for interface development. Yet once a project publishes a
      first major release of materials, the assumption that the research is
      finished makes attracting funding more difficult. While experiments with
      various models of maintenance and sustainability proceed with both
      subscription-based and open-access digital publications, it is clear
      that a fundamental shift is needed in the understanding of the value of
      project sustainability and ongoing development, along with a concomitant
      shift of funding models <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#acls2006">#acls2006</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">Nor should sustainability be narrowly conceived. Informal user
      feedback on <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> suggests that, at least
      with respect to encyclopedic resources, users now firmly expect that
      scholarly digital publications will be kept up-to-the-minute and respond
      to user suggestions. Most digital humanities projects presumably would
      wish to benefit from this respect in which they remain "undone": if we
      are to evolve useful tools and resources we need carefully to assess how
      people use them and experiment with ways of making them better. Such
      inquiry is integral to the Orlando Project’s continuing research, since
      two of its major aims were to establish the viability of extensive,
      domain-specific semantic markup to enable new kinds of scholarship, and
      to help shift scholarly users of electronic materials towards more
      complex engagement with electronic resources. The project also aimed to
      leverage the markup in ways that we did not have the resources to
      implement: whether we can ever have done with, that is to have realised,
      those ambitions will depend on future developments.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">The Orlando Project directs its research towards two practically
      inexhaustible fields: women’s literary history and the capacity of
      computing — specifically of extensive XML markup — to serve the needs of
      this area of humanities inquiry. "Done" becomes, over the course of such
      an ongoing and complex digital project, a strategic, continually
      negotiated marker valuable in a range of ways for defining a specific
      stage of a process which is not unlike that of Lady Mary Wortley
      Montagu’s solo periodical "To be continued as long as the Author thinks
      fit, and the Public likes it" [<a class="ref" href="#montagu1993">Montagu 1993</a>, 105]. Although <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> diverged radically from the sense of
      authorship invoked here, Montagu conjures succinctly a dynamic
      relationship between continued production and reception that is as true
      to the era of digital production as it was to print culture in the
      eighteenth century. "Done" for <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> the
      textbase is only newly open, that is beginning, for our users. For this
      project, so closely focused on a major deliverable, the post-publication

      our two fields of research: that of the relations between <cite class="title italic">Orlando</cite> and its users.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">Although they are by no means all unique to digital publication, the
      factors outlined here, ranging from project conception and design
      through modes of textuality and publication to complications in
      sustainability and archiving, work collectively to complicate what
      "done" means in the context of digital research. They come of
      participating in a rapidly transforming context for research and
      publication in the humanities. Many of these threads are tied together
      by a common concern that has not been present for major projects that
      issue in print publication: the question of how to make the results of
      the research continuingly available to others after the point of initial
      publication. Whatever "done" means for a particular project, those
      involved face the challenge of ensuring that it does not paradoxically
      mean a swift end to scholarly circulation and contribution. While a
      comparison to the loss of the library at Alexandria in the pre-print era
      might be a tad hyperbolic, it is sobering to contemplate the waste of
      knowledge and intellectual effort that would result from the failure of
      the academic community to resolve the thorny problem of how to sustain
      access, over the long term, to the results of the first generation of
      experimental endeavours in the digital humanities if we can’t figure out
      what is to be done.</div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d31256e355"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>Even with the relatively straight-forward
