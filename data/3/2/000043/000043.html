    searching for meaningful patterns across many hundreds or thousands of documents. In this study,
    we apply comparative text mining to a large database of 20th century Black Drama in an effort to
    examine linguistic distinctiveness of gender, race, and nationality. We first run tests on the
    plays of American versus non-American playwrights using a variety of learning techniques to
    classify these works, identifying those which are incorrectly classified and the features which
    distinguish the plays. We achieve a significant degree of performance in this
    cross-classification task and find features that may provide interpretative insights. Turning
    our attention to the question of gendered writing, we classify plays by male and female authors
    as well as the male and female characters depicted in these works. We again achieve significant
    results which provide a variety of feature lists clearly distinguishing the lexical choices made
    by male and female playwrights. While classification tasks such as these are successful and may
    be illuminating, they also raise several critical issues. The most successful classifications
    for author and character genders were accomplished by normalizing the data in various ways.
    Doing so creates a kind of distance from the text as originally composed, which may limit the
    interpretive utility of classification tools. By framing the classification tasks as binary
    oppositions (male/female, etc), the possibility arises of stereotypical or "lowest common
     denominator" results which may gloss over important critical elements, and may also
    reflect the experimental design. Text mining opens new avenues of textual and literary research
    by looking for patterns in large collections of documents, but should be employed with close
    attention to its methodological and critical limitations.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The Black stage has been an important locus for exploring the evolution of Black identity and
    self-representation in North America, Africa, and many African diaspora countries.
    African-American playwrights have examined many of the most contentious issues in American
    history since emancipation — such as migration, exploitation, racial relations, racial violence,
    and civil rights activism — while writers outside of the United States have treated similar
    themes arising from the history of colonialism, slavery, and apartheid. Alexander Street Press
    (ASP), in collaboration with the ARTFL Project, has developed a database of over 1,200 plays
    written from the mid-1800s to the present by more than 180 playwrights from North America, as
    well as English-speaking Africa, the Caribbean, and other nations. The Black Drama collection is
    remarkable for the wealth of information provided for each play as well as for the authors,
    characters, and performance histories of these works. While such extensive metadata permits
    sophisticated search and analysis of the collection, it also provides an environment that lends
    itself well to experiments in machine learning and text mining.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Using the Black Drama data, we examine the degree to which machine learning can isolate
    stylistic or content characteristics of authors and/or characters having particular attributes —
    gender, race, and nationality — and the degree to which pairs of author/character attributes
    interact. We attempt to discover if lexical style or content markers could be found which
    reliably distinguish plays or speeches broken down by a particular characteristic, such as
    gender of character. A positive result would constitute strong evidence for distinctive, in this
    example male and female, character voices in the sample of plays. If distinctiveness could be
    shown, we then sought some "characterization" of the differences found, in terms
    of well defined grammatical or semantic classes.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3109e154">[1]</a> Secondarily, we attempt to see whether and
    how plausibly comparative data mining tools could aid scholars doing literary critical work.
    Beyond the statistical results, we examine features the various algorithms used to classify
    texts and try to determine the degree to which they illuminate or deepen our understanding of
    the texts in the database.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">We find that comparative tools doing supervised learning are quite good at classifying plays
    by American versus non-American authors. Even the outliers, or misclassified plays, demonstrate
    that these algorithms are able to identify American writers by language usage with remarkable
    reliability. We are slightly less successful when trying to distinguish the gender of author
    and/or character. This gender experiment, however, does reveal differences in the ways male and
    female authors and characters use language.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Equally important to the relative abilities of individual tools to classify texts, our
    experiments have alerted us to potential concerns about data mining as a critical or
    interpretive endeavor. Comparative classifiers quite powerfully lump together texts and objects
    that they find "similar" or "dissimilar." However, as we go
    forward, we have to try to develop results analysis that does not rely on simple binary
    opposition. Framing comparative tasks based on existing, often binary categories, can lead to
    results which have a distinctly stereotypical or "lowest common denominator"
    feel. Application of these new technologies in humanistic research requires that that we
    understand not only how the tools work, but that we also bring to bear critical evaluation of
    the questions we ask, the tasks we ask the tools to perform, and the results obtained.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Black Drama Database</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The Black Drama collection developed by Alexander Street Press has, at the time of this work,
    over 1,200 plays by 181 primary authors containing 13.3 million words, written from the middle
    of the 19th century to the present, including many previously unpublished works [<a class="ref" href="#bldr2005">BLDR 2005</a>]. As
    might be expected of a collection of texts from a particular literary genre, this collection
    cannot in any way be considered a "random" or statistically representative sample of Black
    writing in the 20th century. Rather, it reflects editorial decisions and includes key works from
    a number of American and non-American artistic movements, such as the Harlem Renaissance, Black
    Arts Movement, and Township Theatre, as well as the principle works by many critically acclaimed
    authors whom the editors consider, not unreasonably, the most important playwrights. The
    database contains 963 works by 128 male playwrights (10.8 million words) and 243 pieces by 53
    female playwrights (2.5 million words). The most important authors in the collection include
    Langston Hughes (49 plays), Ed Bullins (47), OyamO (43), and Willis Richardson (41). Plays by
    Americans dominate the collection (831 titles), with the remaining 375 titles representing the
    works of African and Caribbean authors. The database contains 317,000 speeches by 8,392 male
    characters and 192,000 speeches by 4,162 female characters. There are 336,000 speeches by 7,067
    black characters and 55,000 by 1,834 white characters with a smattering of speeches by other
    racial groups. As would be expected, the predominance of American authors is reflected in the
    nationalities of speakers in the plays. 272,000 speeches are by American characters and 71,000
    by speakers from a variety of African nations.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Like other Alexander Street Press data sets, the Black Drama collection is remarkable for its
    detailed encoding and amount of metadata associated with authors, titles, acts/scenes,
    performances, and characters. Of particular interest for this study are the data available for
    authors and characters which are stored as "stand-off mark-up" data tables. The
    character table, for example, contains some 13,360 records with 30 fields including name(s),
    race, age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, occupation, sexual orientation, performers, if a real
    person, and type. Even more extensive information is available for authors and titles. The
    character data are joined to each character speech, giving 562,000 objects that can be queried
    by the full range of character attributes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The ARTFL search system, PhiloLogic [<a class="ref" href="#philologic2007">PhiloLogic 2007</a>], allows joining of object attribute
    searches, forming a matrix of author/title/character searching. For example, one can search for
    words in speeches by female, black, American characters depicted by male, non-American authors
    in comedies first published during the first half of the 20th century. Given this architecture,
    designed to support traditional digital humanities research tasks, user-initiated full-text word
    searches on author and character attributes can help scholars examine specific questions about
    language use and character depiction. Initial work, for example, on racial epithets in this
    collection reveals striking differences in the use of such language between male and female
    authors and characters as well as characters of different races. The plays feature extensive use
    of racial epithets, especially the frequently appearing "n-word" and its
    variants. The 5,116 (3.8/10000 words) occurrences of this slur appear in just under 1 in 100
    dialogue shifts in the collection and in almost half of all the plays (515). Its extensive use
    by a substantial majority (119/181) of playwrights in this collection suggests that it has had
    an important role in the representation of Black experience in the past century.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3109e194">[2]</a> An
    examination of frequencies suggests that its use is marked by a variety of social factors, such
    as gender of author and gender/race of character. Male playwrights use the
     "n-word" twice as frequently as female authors (4.2 vs 2.1/10000 words).
    Similarly, male characters overall are depicted using this slur almost twice as frequently as
    female characters (9.5 vs 5.0/1000 speeches). However, factoring author gender into the equation
    changes the rates somewhat. While male playwrights still represent the genders using it at
    roughly a 2 to 1, male to female ratio (10.3 vs 5.4/1000 speeches), female authors depict female
    characters using it at a rate more closely equal to that of males (4.8 male vs 3.5 female/1000
    speeches). This leveling of comparative rate may be an artifact of the moderate preference of
    female authors to represent female characters, as just over a third (34.7%) of speeches in plays
    by male authors are female characters, while female playwrights allocate slight more than half
    (52.1%) of speeches to female characters. Similar gender distinctions are also apparent in
    representation of character race. White characters comprise 14% of speeches (10.5% in female
    authors). Male authors represent white characters using this racial slur at just under twice the
    rate as black characters (15.1 vs 8.6/1000 speeches), female authors represent this distinction
    at a 5 to 4 ratio (5.4 vs 4.3/1000 speeches).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">While illustrative, such "micro-studies" based on standard full-text searches
    for specific words or patterns can do little more than hint at larger discursive and
    representation issues, such as differences between male and female writing. We believe that the
    new generation of machine learning tools and text data mining approaches have the potential to
    reveal more general variations in language use because they look for patterns of differential
    language use broken down by various combinations of author and character attributes. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Philomine: Machine Learning and Text Mining</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Machine learning and text mining techniques are commonly used to detect patterns in large
    numbers of documents. These tools are often used to classify documents based on a training
    sample and apply the resulting model to unseen data. A spam filter, for example, is trained on
    samples of junk mail and real mail, and then used to classify incoming mail based on the
    differences it found in the training set. In our application, we already know the
    classifications of interest, such as author gender and race, for the entire collection. Thus, we
    apply supervised learning techniques<a class="noteRef" href="#d3109e210">[3]</a> with three rather different objectives: to test whether
    we can build a training model to classify texts accurately, to identify individual texts which
    are incorrectly identified after training, and to isolate a set of features<a class="noteRef" href="#d3109e213">[4]</a> which are
    strongly associated with a particular class. To test the accuracy of a training model, we use
    n-fold cross-validation, which trains on some of the sample and then attempts to predict the
    remaining portion of the data set.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3109e218">[5]</a> The machine learning algorithms employed for this study,
    several implementations of Multinomial Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine learners, build
    models by assigning weights to features.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3109e224">[6]</a> Features with high weights, positive or negative,
    are the most influential in identifying a text as belonging to one class or another. Thus,
     "viagra" would be assigned a high feature weight in a model underlying a spam
    filter. In a classification task that results in a high success rate, misclassified documents
    draw particular interest because these failures of the model often point to literary or
    linguistic elements which distinguish the outliers from the mass of correctly classified
    documents.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">To support text mining experimentation, we have implemented a set of machine learning
    extensions to PhiloLogic, our full text analysis system, called PhiloMine [<a class="ref" href="#philomine2007">PhiloMine 2007</a>].
    PhiloMine allows the interactive construction of machine learning and text mining tasks, and
    provides links back to documents and features which facilitate further examination. The
    interactive environment allows users to select and modify the features used for any task in a
    variety of ways. Feature selection and manipulation may be the most important aspects of text
    mining, since the accuracy and validity of classification tasks arise from careful feature
    selection. For example, basing a strong classification of American and non-American texts on
    orthographic variations (color/colour) is certainly effective, but of little use for exploring
    more interesting differences. In addition to PhiloMine, we also use stand-alone text mining
    applications in cases where we require more sophisticated text sampling or other functions not
    supported in the interactive environment.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Black Nationality and the Diaspora</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The diverse Black Drama corpus is a useful collection for examining the stage throughout the
    Anglophone black diaspora, allowing specific focus on the impact of colonialism and
    independence, and for comparing African-American plays with works from other cultures. The
    collection contains 394 plays by American and 303 plays by non-American playwrights written
    during the period we are studying, 1950-2006. In this experiment, we tested the degree to which
    we could distinguish between American and non-American plays. To this end, we generated an
    excluded feature list of words with common spelling differences — such as
     "color/colour,""center/centre," etc — that would have had an impact on results. We further
    excluded words or names that might appear frequently in a small number of texts, limiting
    classification on features present in less than 80% but in more than 10% of the documents. The
    resulting feature list numbered approximately 4200 surface forms of words.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">For this preliminary experiment, we achieved accuracy rates ranging 85% to 92% depending on
    the algorithm selected. Specific classifiers yielded slightly different accuracy rates, partly
    because they weight features and function differently. Using the parameters described above with
    PhiloMine, the Multinomial Naive Bayesian (MNB) classifier generally had high rates of success
    distinguishing American and non-American plays, 88.8 percent correct with 84.4 percent correct
    on cross-validation. Other classifiers achieved similar performance rates for this task. The
    Weka (Weka3) implementation of MNB attained 91.4% training and 84.7% cross-validated accuracy
    and the Weka SMO<a class="noteRef" href="#d3109e249">[7]</a> achieved 94.0% cross-validated accuracy. To ensure that results were not
    artifacts of the classifiers themselves, we ran random falsification tests, deliberately
    randomizing the document instances to confuse the classifier [<a class="ref" href="#ruiz1998">Ruiz and López-de-Teruel 1998</a>]. As
    would be expected, random falsification generally gave accuracy rates around 50%, such as 49.2
    percent using MNB. Our tests revealed that there are significant differences between American
    and non-American plays, and various learning algorithms can identify them reliably.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Splitting the time period in 1984, we found some indication that American and non-American

    The somewhat lower accuracy for the classification of plays in the later period
    suggests that these discourses might be merging to an extent. But one should not exclude the
    possibility that smaller sample sizes may have had some impact on this task.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">The efficacy of this classification task is matched, to some degree, by the less than
    startling features most strongly associated with the two bodies of texts. <a href="#appendix1">Appendix One</a> shows the
    top 200 features most predictive of works by American and non-American playwrights. The American
    plays are marked by their use of slang, references to some place names, and orthographical
    renderings of speech. The state names suggest a Southern, rural backdrop to many plays, but the
    terms "hallway" and "downtown" have a decidedly urban feel. The
    top features of non-American authors had very few slang words and comparatively fewer words that
    reflect spoken language. Many, in fact, belong to a traditional social sphere or reveal more
    formal attitudes toward government, as noted by terms like "crown,""palace,""politicians" and "corruption." The features assigned the highest
    probabilities in this classification task strike the casual observer as both expected and
    reasonable.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">While an extended discussion of the features isolated in this experiment is beyond the scope
    of this paper, a couple of observations are warranted. First, is the number of features that can
    be selected for a successful classification task is surprisingly small. We selected the top 30
    features from the lists for American and non-American playwrights (a standard PhiloMine
    function): <blockquote><p>abroad alabama blasted buddy cattle chief chop colored compound
     corruption county custom don downtown dude eh elders forbid funky gal georgia git goat goats
     gods gon' gonna hallway hmm hunger jive jones lawd learnt mississippi momma mon na naw nothin
     outta palace pat politicians priest princess professor punk quarrel rubbish rude runnin' sho
     tryin' warriors whiskey wives y' ya' yo'</p></blockquote> Based on this tiny feature set, we achieved
    similar cross-validated classification performance: MNB 90%; Weka Bayes 85.5%; and Weka SMO
    88.8%. While effective on a technical level, few critics would find this list to be a sufficient
    way to characterize the differences between American and non-American Black drama. The second
    observation is that different classifiers appear to give weights to remarkably different
    features. For example, the Weka Naive Bayesian classifier generates a single list of features
    that looks very little like those above. One sees no place names, no "speech"
    words, and few terms that stand out on their own as necessarily African, traditional, urban, or
    Southern: <blockquote><p>thinks, greeting, aid, million, taken, facts, serve, obviously,
     mighty, guitar, gray, medicine, twenty, tied, shown, practical, matters, corn, luther,
     interview</p></blockquote> The Weka SMO classifier identifies features that are more comparable to the
    list from the MNB. The 20 most heavily weighted features of each corpus were, for American
    authors: <blockquote><p>practically, folks, ought, besides, hung, screamed, negro, range,
     asses, traveling, finishing, underneath, toward, negroes, barely, surround, humor, reaches,
     bound, ending, sounds</p></blockquote> and for non-American authors: <blockquote><p>eh, quiet,
     pause, rubbish, expose, taxi, hides, concrete, noise, behave, food, sympathy, although, remind,
     usual, useless, visiting, trousers, towards, leaves, sleep</p></blockquote> While all three of these
    algorithms produced strong results classifying authors as American and non-American, the
    different features they rely on raise questions about their usefulness for literary scholars
    studying text collections.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">In the case of these three tests, the MNB classifier's feature sets are the easiest to grasp
    immediately. They point to differences in speech patterns between Americans and non-Americans,
    different social structures, and different environments. The feature set of the Weka Naive
    Bayesian classifier makes very little intuitive sense. Why is it that the word
     "thinks," either by itself or in conjunction with other terms, most effectively
    distinguishes a play as American or non-American? To a lesser degree, the Weka SMO classifier's
    feature set suffers from the same liability. These last classifiers do not give the easy access
    into the plays that the MNB does. The user can look at the feature set of that classifier and,
    almost immediately, begin thinking about issues like the migration of black Americans from the
    rural South to Northern cities. The drawback to the immediacy of this feature set is that it
    also has a "stereotypical" feel. Plays by non-American black authors, following a
    simple-minded reading of the MNB result set, might be thought to take place in villages where
    chiefs and elders buy wives with goats and cattle. In this sense, the features tend to obscure
    any nuance in either corpus because the algorithm itself tends to be very selective as it
    generates a model.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Beyond feature lists, an examination of incorrectly classified documents demonstrates the
    utility of comparative classification. In most PhiloMine tasks, the system will identify
    documents that are not correctly classified. As might be expected, some non-American subgroups
    were classified better than others. Thus, British, Australian, and Canadian authors were more
    frequently misclassified in this task than African or Caribbean playwrights. Inspecting the
    outliers was instructive. For example, eight plays by Kia Corthron were consistently
    misclassified as American. Upon further review, the problem arose not because of the algorithm,
    but the metadata we provided it. The editors incorrectly identified this American playwright as
    a Canadian. Because of the lexical features it found, the classifier decided that her plays, in
    fact, should not be grouped with those of the non-American authors, as the metadata would have
    had her, but with the American authors. This misclassification was actually a correct
    classification that alerted us to the error in the metadata. Other outliers also bear further
    inspection, which may raise further critical questions. The plays of Montserratian Edgar White
    were correct classified except for one, <cite class="title italic">When Night Turn Day</cite>, which
    is set in the Bronx. Similarly, American Joseph Walker was correctly classified in 9 of 10
    cases, except for <cite class="title italic">The Lion is a Soul Brother</cite>, set in "rural/jungle
    West Africa." OyamO's <cite class="title italic">Three Red Falcons?</cite>, set in rural Nigeria, was
    incorrectly classified, but so too was his 1995 play, <cite class="title italic">Dancing on the
     Brink</cite>, which was set in Palo Alto. Examination of outliers in a generally successful
    classification task may provoke new questions about why a particular text was not classified
    properly.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Comparative text mining on the nationality of Black playwrights in the second half of the 20th
    century shows clear distinctions between American and non-American authors. The algorithms
    consistently achieve high levels of performance and generate distinguishing feature lists that
    are of potential interest in helping to characterize topics, themes, and styles that mark each
    group. Finally, the outliers or incorrectly classified authors and plays may lead to further
    critical scrutiny, allowing for variations within the general classification.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">It may be objected that our classification task itself is a trivial case, attempting to
    confirm a distinction that is all too obvious to be of significant literary interest. A task
    like this, however, provides a good test case for verifying how well classifiers are able to
    function. We were able to check the accuracy of our results easily through the bibliographic
    data. In the case of the outlier, Corthron, a web search confirmed that she is, in fact,
    American. Of course, features that reveal certain linguistic and dramatic differences between
    the American and non-American plays might not be particularly surprising. Authors tend to place
    characters in localities and use idiomatic language they themselves know. For example, an
    American playwright is more likely to set a play in Mississippi and depict characters using a
    Southern vernacular. However, the features are often able to bring out further, less obvious
    stylistic and creative choices in operation across text corpora. It is beyond the scope of this
    paper to address just what these could be. A scholar with a deeper knowledge of this body of
    works could potentially examine the feature sets and find lexical patterns that point to larger
    tendencies. In the end, the algorithms can only rely on and propose what they find to be
    statistically significant. The scholar, as always, must decide the meaning of the results.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Mining Author and Character Gender</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Classification tasks based on the gender of authors, characters, and a combination of the two
    provides a more challenging test than classification by author nationality. Previous work
    suggests that gender classification tasks are somewhat less accurate and that the feature sets
    they generate are less obviously distinctive [<a class="ref" href="#argamon2003">Argamon et al. 2003</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#koppel2002">Koppel et al. 2002</a>]. The nature of these
    documents, plays with male and female characters and with a significant amount of generic
    language found in stage directions and other textual objects, increases the difficulty of
    automatic classification. The issue of male authors writing female characters and vice versa
    makes the task of classifying by gender more difficult, but also introduces the ability to test
    the degree to which authors of one gender can effectively write characters of the other
    gender.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">The Black Drama collection contains 573 (82%) plays by male and 124 (18%) by female

    selection is deceptively accurate, with MNB returning 79.4% cross-validated accuracy and Weka
    SMO 85.1% cross-validated. The Weka "confusion matrix" indicates that a
    significant majority of male authors are correctly classified while performance on female
    authors is less than 50%:

    The classifier performed only slightly better than if it had simply guessed
     "male" for every document (82%). Therefore, to determine whether the system was
    in fact finding a gender difference, we had to balance corpus sizes. PhiloMine supports a
    standard corpus balancing option that randomly selects documents from the larger sample until it
    has found a number equal to the smaller class. Since this is a random selection, effectively
    comparing all of the female plays against a set of male documents, one needs to perform this
    task numerous times to determine an average accuracy rate. Using the Weka NB and SMO functions
    five times each, cross-validated results indicate a fair degree of success: <blockquote class="eg"><pre><tt>WekaSMO (cross-validated): 70.2%, 78.2%, 79.0%, 73.0%, 73.8%</tt></pre></blockquote><blockquote class="eg"><pre><tt>WekaNB (cross-validated): 65.7%, 74.2%, 68.1%, 70.2%, 69.8%</tt></pre></blockquote> Classifying author gender
    of randomly balanced test sets arrived at an accuracy of 70% for Naive Bayesian and 75% for
    Support Vector Machine. Similar performance of high 60%/low 70% accuracy was also generated by
    the MNB function. Applying a random falsification test to one of these tasks we found an
    accuracy rate of 49%. This suggests that, while it is not as strong as in the nationality
    classification, a signal can be found that is not an artifact of the selected classifier or
    other influences.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">The classification tasks to this point have been looking at entire plays with no attempt to

    of the other gender. Controlling for obvious skewing influences, particularly as a control
    following more generic experiments, tends to provide more coherent results, but at the cost of
    creating composite documents which do not reflect the structure and organization of the plays as

    We eliminated stage directions, cast lists, and other such apparatus containing some 4.5 million
    words, while combining individual speeches of each character into one object for faster
    processing. This changed the unit of analysis from documents to composite character speeches
    with associated metadata, including author attributes. For the period 1950-2006, there are 4,228
    characters by male authors and 865 characters by female playwrights with more than 200 words.
    For the same period, there are 3,226 male characters and 1,742 female characters.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Classifying all the characters by author gender using the PhiloMine Bayesian function resulted

    72.1%, 71.0%, 72.2%, and 71.6%. Deliberately shuffling the character instances of randomly
    balanced characters returned results approximating the expected 50% accuracy: 47.6%, 51.2%, and
    50.8%. Similar results were obtained for classifications by character gender. Overall, for all
    of the characters, MNB accurately classified 73.2% of the instances. Five runs of randomly

    Random falsification tests again approximate the expected 50% accuracy: 48.4%, 48.1%, and 50.4%.
    Classification of gender or author and character on composite character objects showed modest

    authors, female authors, male characters, and female characters. For each of these, we used
    SVM-Light<a class="noteRef" href="#d3109e415">[8]</a> to build a model to identify authors and characters by gender. As indicated in

    and female playwrights without respect to character gender. The features suggest a rather
    traditional set of gender distinctions. Male authors tend to focus on legal/criminal issues
    (officer, gang, pistol, jail, etc.); numerous obscenities and slurs (bullshit, nigger(s),
    goddamn, fuck, shit); music (band, drum, leader, drums, spiritual, player, jazz); and money
    (dollars, price, cents, cash, etc.). Female playwrights of this period tend to privilege issues
    concerning family/home (child, stories, hug, mama, girls, birth); emotive states (smiling,
    imagine, memories, memory, happiness, happy); descriptions (handsome, lovely, grace, cute,
    courage, loving, ugly); and women (herself, girls, she, female, lady, women, her). The
    representation of traditional gender roles are most notable in the characterization of
    non-American male authors. As shown in <a href="#appendix3">Appendix Three</a>, male characters are given very clear
    public roles, with the top eight words by probability ratios being "chief, order,
     government, lead, power, position, country, land" while the female characters are
    limited to the private realm ("husband, dress, shame, marry, doctor, married, please,
     parents").</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">Gender characterization among American authors writing between 1950-2006 (Appendices 4 and 5)
    provides evidence that men and women depict characters slightly differently. The feature sets
    are rather similar: both contain numbers (men generally do counting) and share terms as varied
    as sir, american, power, bitch, country, and killed. But the male list is noticeably coarser,
    with more profanity, the term "nigger(s)," and more references to law enforcement
    and violence. With only a few exceptions, the female character feature lists have basically the
    same domestic tenor. In contrast to male characters, female characters apparently use very
    little profanity and seem to be much less involved in struggles with public authorities. Of
    course, these lists only reveal generalities. The features are differential frequencies. There
    might in fact be foul-mouthed female characters in the corpus who are active in the public
    sphere. But those characters would probably be exceptions. The degree to which these lists
    reveal true differences among black American male and female authors is a matter for discussion.
    The important thing is that the mining algorithm gives fuel to the discussion and serves as a
    starting point for closer textual study.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">This same character gender classification test on non-American authors yields feature sets
    suggesting even more disparate depictions of the sexes than among American authors. Appendices <a href="#appendix6">6</a>
    and <a href="#appendix7">7</a> show that, for authors of both sexes, male characters inhabit the public sphere, their
    discourse deals with leadership, and they are more likely to use grammatically precise terms
    like "which" and "whom." Female characters' language, again,
    primarily centers on domestic concerns. Distinctions between male and female authors' use of
    language in the depiction of their characters are few. One of the striking differences, however,
    is that only the male characters written by female authors in this data set use scatalogical
    language at a significant rate. And comparing the results from the American and non-American
    tests highlights the different concerns for these characters who inhabit different cultures.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Classification of texts by gender of playwrights, characters, and the combination of the two
    is a more difficult test than by nationality. Results ranging from high-60 percent accuracy for
    plays as they are found to the mid-80s in carefully constructed samples extracted from the
    texts. It is also clear that the features used to construct classifier models might be of
    interest to literary researchers in that they identify themes and language use that characterize
    gender distinctions. Of course, men talk more of wives than women and only women tend to call
    other women "hussies," so it is hardly surprising that male and female
    authors/characters speak of different things in somewhat different ways. The features suggest,
    however, that we are finding "lowest common denominators" which distinguish male
    from female, but which may also privilege particular stereotypes. The unhappy relationship of
    Black American men with the criminal justice system or the importance of family matters to women
    are both certainly themes raised in these plays. The experimental design itself, using
    classifiers to detect patterns of word usage which most distinguish the genders, may bring to
    the forefront literary and linguistic elements which play a relatively minor role in the texts
    themselves.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">We have found that, although algorithms can in fact detect differences in lexical usage to a
    striking degree and output feature sets that characterize differences between corpora of data,
    human scholars must still do the work of scrutinizing results and, more importantly, decide how
    best to develop these tools for humanities research. Fundamentally, automatic classifiers deal
    with general features and common traits. In contrast, in recent decades, literary criticism has
    focused on the peripheries, often looking at the ways understudied works by authors from
    underrepresented groups work within a larger cultural context. Literary critics have tried to
    nuance general understanding about what the mainstream is and how it works. As we mentioned
    above, a danger in framing comparative tasks based on binary oppositions is that doing so can
    produce simplistic or stereotypical results. Furthermore, given the power of classifiers, we
    might always be able to prove or detect some binary opposition between two groups of texts. And
    so the task before us, if we want to develop tools to aid literary criticism, is to try in some
    way to respond to the values driving scholarship currently and, as those values change, continue
    to take them into account. We must also keep in mind that measures of success and procedure are
    often different for computer scientists and literary critics. For example, using only 60 total
    feature terms, 30 per corpus, we can classify the Black Drama texts as American or non-American
    with approximately 90% accuracy. Distinguishing differences on such a small number of words is
    an impressive technical feat, to be sure. But to a literary scholar, such a circumscribed way of
    thinking about creative work may not be terribly fruitful. As we go forward, we will have to try
    to bridge gaps such as these. Our success in this endeavor will, of course, depend upon close
    collaboration between those building the data mining tools and those who will finally use
    them.</div></div><div id="appendix1" class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Appendix One</h1><div class="table"><table class="table"><tr class="row label"><td valign="top" class="cell">American Playwrights</td><td valign="top" class="cell">Non-American Playwrights</td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">ya', momma, gon', jones, sho, mississippi, dude, hallway, nothin, georgia, yo', naw, alabama, git, outta, y', downtown, colored, lawd, mon, punk, whiskey, county, tryin', runnin', jive, buddy, gal, gonna, funky, louis, busted, piano, banks, folks, huh, talkin', ol', stack, rip, washington, exiting, hisself, lyin', kin, tellin', blues, callin', preacher, porch, tom, luther, an', buck, stairs, lookin', pops, dime, holler, nothin', lotta, workin', puttin', doin', negro, sittin', somethin', johnson, chocolate, thinkin', chicago, dope, uh, neighborhood, humor, negroes, crosses, c', ain', sayin', pop, askin', should', reverend, bein', oughta, yep, givin', basement, gray, mule, smith, bitches, bill, closet, freak, figured, makin', feelin', havin', clay, hammer, livin', ta, gut, upstage, ass, avenue, lee, sidewalk, waitin', reckon, wanna, rap, dig, ma', hop, takin', singers, someplace, lincoln, cats, june, gotta, playin', niggers, asses, mama', gettin', comin', walkin', goin', em, satan, cute, intense, nigger, ole, harlem, cept, daddy', lord', righteous, nerve, sofa, awhile, jazz, bullshit, somebody', apartment, punches, toward, um, da, summer, liable, aunt, grace, paul, could', rag, shit, dammit, blackness, hooked, joint, southern, frank, gotten, upstairs, sung, holiday, honey, baby, downstairs, messing, con, grins, hung, dreamed, would', d, kinda, yea, juice, cause, traveling, fuck, bar, downstage, butt, drift, name', guys, favorite, colors, sadness, screw, congregation, dollar </td><td valign="top" class="cell">na, learnt, don, goat, rubbish, eh, chief, elders, compound, custom, rude, blasted, quarrel, chop, wives, professor, goats, pat, corruption, cattle, hmm, priest, hunger, palace, forbid, warriors, princess, gods, abroad, politicians, dey, boot, harvest, ancestors, mate, idiot, d', trace, witch, nearer, frighten, bloody, economic, messenger, native, palm, government, royal, crown, greetings, properly, addressing, tradition, visitors, madam, strangers, development, patience, drumming, mere, village, citizen, rejected, husbands, youth, fourth, fathers, disturb, proceed, shall, salute, surrender, dem, forest, hen, port, duties, british, prisoners, panting, gate, prime, flood, accused, rejoice, politics, x, excitedly, trousers, taxi, senior, reject, branches, towards, officer, seas, tribe, political, wailing, accompanied, fetch, whom, sand, official, england, arrives, disgrace, beads, reply, market, guards, hut, oil, 1st, sacrifice, wisdom, o, boss, disaster, assistant, obey, corpse, behave, arrival, improve, cannot, stream, expose, council, iron, matters, tax, democracy, london, wealth, leadership, women', 2nd, warrior, kneel, obeys, appeal, thief, soldier, greet, burial, advise, deaf, alarmed, throne, arrive, therefore, judgement, warn, petty, powers, haste, stinking, medical, await, armed, instructions, sergeant, fails, estate, worship, soil, madness, land, foreign, breed, military, beg, rushed, liberty, graves, secretary, absence, greeting, cock, enemies, court, politician, object, lake, urge, oath, greets, fruits, disease, gathering, insult, sons, shield, bundle, succeed, idle, useless, message, thirst</td></tr></table><div class="caption"><div class="label">Table 6. </div>American vs non-American Playwrights, 1950-2006: MultiNomial Naive

     e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#argamon2003">Argamon et al. 2003</a>], addresses both goals using techniques from machine learning,
     supplemented by more traditional computer-assisted text analysis.</div><div class="endnote" id="d3109e194"><span class="noteRef">[2]</span>It is important to mention that this term occurs much more frequently than less offensive
     terms like negro* (3351) or positive expressions such as afr.* americ.* (230) in this sample.</div><div class="endnote" id="d3109e210"><span class="noteRef">[3]</span>Supervised machine learning is a process for building a classifier from labeled training
     data. For example, one might present a learner with two sets of e-mails, identified by human
     evaluators as either spam or not spam. The learner generates a statistical model which best
     captures this distinction. Following training, the model generated by the learner is used to
     classify unseen instances, such as incoming e-mail. Supervised learning is contrasted with
     unsupervised learning, which is not based on preidentified class labeled training data. For
     example, clustering algorithms use a variety of measures of similarity to assign instances to
     groups.</div><div class="endnote" id="d3109e213"><span class="noteRef">[4]</span>"Features" in this context means the data being used to perform the machine
     learning task. Each instance, typically a document or part of a document, may have an arbitrary
     number of features which may include word, lemma or word sequence (n-grams) frequencies as well
     as other elements of the data which can be computed, such as sentence length or part-of-speech
     frequencies.</div><div class="endnote" id="d3109e218"><span class="noteRef">[5]</span>Cross validation is a technique to evaluate the likelihood that the machine learning model
     being generated by a learner is "over-fitted" to the training data, which would limit the
     effectiveness of the classifier to properly handle unseen instances. Over-fitting will also
     tend to weight relatively unrepresentative features too highly. Cross validation is performed
     by subdividing the training data into random groups (often 10), training on some of these
     groups and evaluating the predictions on the remainder.</div><div class="endnote" id="d3109e224"><span class="noteRef">[6]</span>Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are commonly used
     techniques in the machine learning community. MNB is based on calculating the prior
     probabilities of each feature in two or more classes. Thus, "viagra" in an MNB spam filter
     would be assigned as very high probability of being in a spam e-mail. For an unseen instance,
     the system calculates the probabilities for each feature being a member of a particular class,
     adding up all of the probabilities to assign one or more classifications to the new instance.
     SVMs are somewhat more complex, as they attempt to divide training data into maximally
     separated groups by adjusting feature weights.</div><div class="endnote" id="d3109e249"><span class="noteRef">[7]</span>The Weka3 system refers to Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) which is one of a number
     of heuristics to allow Support Vector Machines to perform reasonably quickly and effectively.</div><div class="endnote" id="d3109e415"><span class="noteRef">[8]</span>We conducted these experiments using a stand-alone parallelized implementation of the
