                that are intended for use by humanities scholars interested in applying data mining
                and information visualization tools to the task of hypothesis formulation. The
                trained droplets provide several functions. Their primary purpose is to encapsulate
                the results of the software training phase. They can be saved for future re-use
                against other collections or combinations of collections. They can be modified by
                having the user accept or reject features identified by the data mining software.
                Finally, they can also contain choices for how to display and organize items in the
                collection. The opportunity to develop a new interface object presents the designer
                with the challenge of effectively communicating what the tool is good for and how it
                is used. This paper outlines the design process we followed in creating the visual
                representations of these interface objects, describes the communicative strengths
                and weaknesses of a number of alternative designs, and discusses the importance of
                the study of new interface objects as the means of providing the user with new
                interface affordances.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The goal of this paper is to address some of the conceptual issues that arise in the
                design of a new kind of interface object for a specific domain — data mining for the
                humanities. In that context, we describe one component of our research: the design
                of a form of visual representation that would provide humanities scholars with some
                insight into the data mining process, while at the same time making the activity of
                data mining attractive and easy to carry out.</div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000067/resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000067/resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the data mining worksheet for step three."/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>An early sketch of the data mining environment (in this case for the
                        NORA project) shows someone using a droplet trained for identifying the
                        erotic in a set of poems from the Emily Dickinson collection in the
                        Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University
                        of Virginia. Note that the preliminary droplet design shown here (bottom
                        right) has no specifically communicative morphology.</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Our strategy in this interface was to provide the user with a variety of empty
                "droplets" which would be filled with the results of the software training phase
                [<a class="ref" href="#ruecker2006">Ruecker et al.</a>]. Each droplet would
                contain or encapsulate an entire working state of the system, including the
                algorithmic consequences of a particular training exercise, combined with some
                parameters for organizing and selecting the form of the display. The choice of the
                proper word to identify the droplets is in itself a subject of design. Other terms
                that have been suggested include "magnet,""crystal,""capsule,""lens,""charm,""filter,""system state,""kernel," and the very Canadian "hockey puck." Whatever
                these objects are eventually called, for the time being we are using the term
                "droplet," which suggests to us a densely compressed item that can unpack in an
                organic way to influence the entire surroundings. Once a droplet has been trained
                for data mining, it can be saved and applied to the entire collection, or to a
                different collection. A droplet is applied to a collection by dragging and dropping
                it onto a display representing each item, after which the display organizes itself
                in a series of "oil and water" effects. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Of vital significance to the success of this strategy is the design of the droplets.
                The droplets need to be able to represent the relevant information about the data
                mining process in a form that is readily interpretable by humanities scholars. The
                droplet serves in one sense like an icon — a person looking at it will hopefully
                remember what system state it contains. This iconic function should work at
                different scales, at least one of which is quite small. The droplets therefore need
                to be easily visually differentiable one from another, at every scale. Finally, the
                droplets need to be visually appealing. We describe here our initial attempts to
                design these interface objects, based on a set of metaphors to real-world items that
                combine complex visual appearance with a compact form.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Background</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The online availability of a wide range of digital data has resulted in a
                corresponding increase in various kinds of tools for retrieving and manipulating the
                items in a collection [<a class="ref" href="#hockey2000">Hockey 2000</a>]. Interface design researchers have
                worked on systems intended to help users access digital images, work with electronic
                text files, and apply data mining algorithms to a variety of problems, both in the
                sciences and in the humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In the area of digital images, [<a class="ref" href="#bederson2001">Bederson 2001</a>] describes a
                zoomable browser, [<a class="ref" href="#bumgardner2005">Bumgardner et al. 2005</a>] provides an
                experimental search tool that uses a colour wheel as its interface, and <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hascoët1998">#hascoët1998</a></span> discuss the use of maps in accessing a digital library.
                Other examples include [<a class="ref" href="#rodden2001">Rodden et al. 2001</a>], who studied the
                use of similarity clustering for browsing tasks, and [<a class="ref" href="#ruecker2005">Ruecker et al. 2005</a>], who developed a prototype image browser for pill
                identification.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">For tools related to text files, [<a class="ref" href="#pirolli1996">Pirolli et al. 1996</a>] describe
                a system for visualizing documents which allows the user to form dynamic groups.
                [<a class="ref" href="#small1996">Small 1996</a>] developed a 3D prototype for text navigation, where
                the reader moved between columns of text from Shakespeare’s plays. A variety of
                researchers have worked in the area of data mining for text collections of various
                kinds. For example, [<a class="ref" href="#feldman1997">Feldman et al. 1997</a>] discuss early
                efforts in this area, and [<a class="ref" href="#weiss2005">Weiss et al. 2005</a>] provide a recent
                update on methods.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Some researchers have pointed out that the potential for applying data mining tools
                to questions in the humanities lies largely in the capacity of such tools to
                contribute, not primarily to hypothesis testing, but instead to hypothesis
                formulation [<a class="ref" href="#shneiderman2001">Shneiderman 2001</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2003">Ramsay 2003</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2004">Unsworth 2004</a>]. The standard approach in humanities research is not
                to solve a problem by testing one hypothesis against another, but rather to enrich
                the object of study by repeated observation and reporting. Data mining tools and
                their accompanying visualizations, which facilitate pattern finding across a wide
                range of data, can definitely play a role in this process.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">With respect to the design of interfaces for data mining, it is important to remember
                that each new online tool represents a new opportunity for action, or affordance
                [<a class="ref" href="#gibson1979">Gibson 1979</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#vicente2002">Vicente 2002</a>]. For instance, in a
                more conventional approach to the interface for data mining, it would be possible to
                create a history palette that records previous states of the system. However, it is
                not necessarily straightforward to repurpose an item from that history to a new
                collection. By encapsulating the history states as droplets, we make the repurposing
                simpler.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Another significant feature of the droplets is their role in interactivity. By
                providing the user with an item to drag and drop to trigger a series of dynamic
                responses from the system, the droplets help facilitate an instructional aspect: the
                user can see the steps carried out by system, which correspond to the steps
                associated with the droplet. While visually dynamic responses are not reliant on the
                presence of droplets as objects, their existence as part of the user interaction
                helps to suggest to the designer these various new forms of feedback, which are a
                kind of affordance.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Studying these new affordances presents a challenge, in that the researcher by
                definition does not always have an existing object with a similar
                affordance — otherwise it would be a case of a redesign rather than a new tool [<a class="ref" href="#ruecker2003">Ruecker 2003</a>]. Though opinions vary, the current dominant perspective
                is that interface research requires a component of usability study [<a class="ref" href="#nielsen2000">Nielsen 2000</a>], but that usability study alone is probably not enough.
                Attention should also be paid to other factors, such as aesthetics [<a class="ref" href="#karvonen2000">Karvonen 2000</a>], effect <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dillon2001">#dillon2001</a></span>, and sustained use
                over time [<a class="ref" href="#plaisant2004">Plaisant 2004</a>].</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Methodology</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">We began by identifying the kinds of information the user might want to know while
                working with the system. These included an overview of the process, suggestions
                about the kinds of tasks that could be performed using the system, reassurance at
                each point that the right things were happening, and assistance in interpreting the
                results of each stage and moving successfully to the next stage. With the droplets,
                we hoped to be able to communicate what had been done to create them, in order to
                suggest how they might be successfully deployed once they were created.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">To construct the droplets, we generated a candidate list of real-world items that
                have a sufficiently complex physical shape to serve as possible metaphors for the
                complexities of the data mining process. We determined early in the process that it
                would be difficult and probably not helpful to attempt to communicate for this
                demographic the actual algorithms involved, as for example by superimposing an
                equation on a geometric shape. Instead, we hoped to be able to visually express the
                following information:</div><div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Is this a trained droplet or an empty one?</li><li class="item">For trained droplets, has the user accepted the features recommended by the
                    system or has the list of features been modified?</li><li class="item">What kinds of features were included?</li><li class="item">How many features were included?</li><li class="item">What options for display have been associated with the droplet?</li><li class="item">What choices for organizing the display have been applied?</li></ul></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">There are also other pieces of information that could be useful for understanding
                what has been happening. These items need to be communicated somehow but could be
                difficult to associate with the visual appearance of the droplets. These
                include:</div><div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">The name of the collection or collections used in training.</li><li class="item">The size of the collection.</li><li class="item">The size of the training set.</li><li class="item">The name and goals of the person responsible for training the droplet.</li></ul></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Some strategies involving droplet morphology might include using the size of the
                droplet to indicate the size of the training set or of the collection the set was
                drawn from. Internal and external lines can also be thickened or lightened as a way
                of suggesting robustness of the training set. Finally, depending on the visual kind
