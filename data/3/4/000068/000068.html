The inference tool Racer and the programming language Prolog were tested and compared to see if they can serve as a computer assisted approach in this scenario.</p><p>Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good comprehension of logics. Intuitive and individual queries are also difficult to produce with solely logic constructs. Furthermore, information in humanities is often vague, ambiguous, or even contradictory. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply based on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might exceed the limits of logic reasoning.</p><p>At the moment, to the author’s knowledge, only few such approaches, especially in literature studies, have been published. Existing approaches show promising results in modelling information in humanities. Therefore, further research should be directed to make ontologies and further approaches like logic reasoning even more popular and applicable in the humanities and literature studies.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Information seems to be essential for our lives. Humans get information everywhere,
                not only on the Internet, TV or radio channels and books, but also by talking to
                people or looking at road signs. We are constantly faced with problems and by
                solving these problems, our ability of using information is requested. But do we
                always find a solution just in time? And do we know when and where we can use
                information correctly? In daily life, we have to get information as quickly as
                possible. The Internet is a "mine" of information, but, like in a
                real mine, we need to light the darkness, to navigate by maps so that we are able to
                dig at the right point. The Internet is a giant source of information but often
                completely unstructured, leading many to the idea of structuring and grouping
                information presented on the Internet, the <cite class="title italic">Semantic
                Web</cite>. Since the introduction of Semantic Web technologies and standards,
                like <cite class="title italic">RDF</cite> and <cite class="title italic">OWL</cite>,
                ontologies and other related methods have entered many research fields. In life
                science, they are already established, e.g. GeneOntology [<a class="ref" href="#stevens2000">Stevens et al. 2000</a>]. Ontologies belong to approaches of information or
                knowledge representation. Now, this technology has been also introduced into several
                projects in the humanities, e.g. GOLD [<a class="ref" href="#farrar2002">Farrar et al. 2002</a>], WordNet [<a class="ref" href="#gomez2004">Gomez 2004</a>], TermNet [<a class="ref" href="#lungen2007">Lüngen 2007</a>], FRBR <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#renear2006">#renear2006</a></span>, and DISCOVERY [<a class="ref" href="#smith2007">Smith 2007</a>]. GOLD is an ontology for descriptive linguistics, e.g. syntax, morphology or linguistic data structures. WordNet is a lexical database of English that is also presented as an ontology. Thereby, TermNet, a terminological net for the domain of text technology, takes the concepts of WordNet into account. While these are linguistic ontologies, the FRBR ontology defines concepts of bibliographic cataloguing and indexing. Based on domain ontologies and other data bases, the DISCOVERY project links different philosophical projects together.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">But does the obvious popularity of ontologies really point at the advantages? Or is the popularity only a trend in research?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">There are some criticisms of ontologies [<a class="ref" href="#veltman2004">Veltman 2004</a>], <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#shirky2005">#shirky2005</a></span>. Veltman points out that the definition of meaning is often rather limited when using ontologies, especially in humanities. He argues that this definition is adequate for machine-to-machine transactions in, for example, business, but it does not address the needs of culture. There, meaning comprises much more and needs to be handled by more suitable methods. In addition, Shirky criticizes the incomplete methods of classifying things. Summarized, he argues that categorization is always dependent on world views, which might not be accepted by other parties. Both authors hint at very important points, which should be discussed critically. But that goes beyond the scope of this contribution.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Nevertheless, the results of the approaches mentioned before show that ontologies and
                supporting technologies like logic reasoning are useful ways to express structured
                and hierarchical information in the humanities. In literature studies, the usage of
                ontologies is not very common. A reason for this might be that in this field, the
                contribution of an ontology to research topics is often rather difficult.
                Definitions of literary phenomena are unstable and unclear. Furthermore, in
                humanities and especially in literature studies, topics of research often cannot be
                measured like in life science [<a class="ref" href="#zw2008">Zöllner-Weber &amp; Apollon 2008</a>]. As such it seems to be ever more challenging to introduce ontologies to these research areas, and, one might ask, which kinds of applications are offered and whether benefits might be drawn when applying such technologies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Since their initiation in philosophy, ontologies, with their methods of subsumption
                related to semantics, have been expressed by logical expressions. Thereby,
                information about an ontology can be obtained using logic reasoning <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#baader2003a">#baader2003a</a></span>. By formulating logic expressions, information that is
                often implicit or hidden in the ontology can be queried and conclusions can be
                drawn. This means that information about the structure and elements of ontologies
                can be retrieved, which can be of interest for human users, i.e. manual processing
                and automated processing, respectively. For example, even for human users, it might
                be difficult to get a detailed overview of relations between the elements in large
                ontologies without appropriate methods and utilities. Another interesting aspect
                might arise if ontologies from different sources are merged or mapped [<a class="ref" href="#noy2003">Noy 2003</a>, 18–9]. A merging or mapping may result in an enlarged description of the ontology domain.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Such a method is also of interest for schemes and models of topics in the humanities.
                Semantic relations that are essential in humanities can be expressed by creating an
                ontology. After storing information in an ontology, consecutive processing, like logic reasoning, creates further possibilities like consistency checks or support by merging data.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The aim of this work is to investigate probable applications for ontologies in the humanities, especially for literature studies. As mentioned, it is rather challenging to work with ontologies in humanities. In this contribution, an example ontology and its supporting tools, here focused on logic reasoning, are reviewed on three levels: a) the user’s view, b) the methodological limits and c) limits of the tools with respect to literature studies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">In Section 2.1, an introduction to ontologies, especially the way they are used in
                Artificial Intelligence, is given, and their connection to logic reasoning is
                outlined. In Sections 2.2 and 2.3, an ontology for the description of literary
                characters and the application of logic reasoning to this ontology is presented
                [<a class="ref" href="#zw2006a">Zöllner-Weber 2006</a>]. In Section 3, logics related to ontologies are introduced.
                Afterwards, the ontology for literary characters is used to test different
                logic-based methods; two tools, <cite class="title italic">Racer</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Prolog</cite>, are compared. <cite class="title italic">Racer</cite> represents pure inference machines, whereas <cite class="title italic">Prolog</cite> has been taken as an example for logic programming languages. In Section 4, the ontology and the applied logical reasoning tools regarding the aforementioned points are discussed. Finally, a conclusion and an outlook are given.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Materials and Methods</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">In the next sections, an introduction to ontologies and especially to the ontology for literary characters is given.</div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Introduction to Ontologies</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Briefly, ontologies are used to provide organisation and retrieval of information
                semantically. Thereby, similarities between information provided by an ontology are searched by means of a semantic relation rather than by matching search strings or other similar measures. There are two comprehensions of the term of ontology: the pure formalistic approach of classifying objects as in the field of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, and the more transcendental approach in the humanities and especially philosophy.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The term ontology, which originates from philosophy and contains the study of
                    being or existence in general, was introduced by Aristotle [<a class="ref" href="#pl1991">Philosophie-Lexikon 1991</a>].  Aristotle was interested in describing the existence of things in the
                    world. He asked fundamental questions like "What is
                    existence?" On the one hand, he discussed human existence as it is
                    still discussed in philosophy, and on the other hand, he developed a system
                    (universals and particulars) of how the existence can be described, a formalism.
                    In particular, this is based on descriptive logics. The system of these logics
                    is contained in an ontology, which inherits formalistic principles, and
                    therefore is a form of expressing logics. In the ancient world and maybe in
                    Aristotle’s view, the different sciences did not exist separately. In today’s
                    view, he mingled transcendental questions with pure formalism. Over the course
                    of centuries, these two parts have been split into different sciences. In a
                    simplified way, formalism and classification have been moved to natural science
                    and mathematics while the transcendental core of Aristotle’s questions is
                    discussed in philosophy and theology. By transferring the term of an ontology to
                    the AI, it is more restricted and focused on modelling of concepts of the real
                    world in computer systems. Gruber gives a definition: "An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared
                        conceptualisation" [<a class="ref" href="#gruber1993">Gruber 1993</a>, 199]. In
                    this approach, Gruber refers to groups of people with a common comprehension of
                    the world. In that respect, the initial question of existence is no longer in
                    focus but still has to be described. Therefore, the formalism relied upon in an
                    ontology is used. An ontology in AI comprises hierarchically structured
                    concepts, also called classes, of a part of the world (a <em class="term">domain</em>).
                    The representation should be produced in a machine-readable language. Noy et al.
                    explain, "An ontology defines a common vocabulary for
                    researchers who need to share information in a domain" [<a class="ref" href="#noy2001">Noy et al. 2001</a>, 1]. An ontology consists of a set of objects
                    that are divided into classes, concepts, properties (also slots, or roles) and
                    the restrictions of the roles [<a class="ref" href="#noy2001">Noy et al. 2001</a>, 3]. By relating main
                    and more specialized classes to an ontology, a hierarchy can be created.
                    Additionally, so-called instances of the classes represent individual objects of
                    the selected domain. Although, the structure of an ontology is rather static,
                    the included information can be queried and manipulated in several ways, e.g.
                    using W3C standards like the <cite class="title italic">Web Ontology Language</cite>
                    (OWL) or <cite class="title italic">Resource Description Framework Schema</cite>
                    (RDFS) [<a class="ref" href="#antoniou2003">Antoniou &amp; Harmelen 2003</a>]. OWL has been created to enlarge web sites
                    with semantic information and to make the Internet usable as a structured
                    information source [<a class="ref" href="#ziegler2004">Ziegler 2004</a>, 126].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Discussion about ontologies, in this contribution, is focused on the formalistic method. Therefore, the discussion of existence, which has a long tradition in humanities, is not relevant here because an ontology is just seen as a very useful method to structure phenomena of literature studies. In the following, the ontology, criteria, and tools are presented.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">An Ontology for the Description of Literary Characters</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">To investigate ontologies and logic reasoning as tools in humanities, a concrete
                example is used. Here, the description of literary characters has been realised as an ontology.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Briefly, several theories of literary characters [<a class="ref" href="#jannidis2004">Jannidis 2004</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#nieragden1995">Nieragden 1995</a>] are combined to create a base of
                    a formal description using an OWL ontology [<a class="ref" href="#zw2006b">Zöllner-Weber &amp; Witt 2006</a>]. Categories which describe features and actions of
                    characters mentioned in stories had to be adapted and applied. It is aimed at
                    representing the mental information structure of a reader, which (s)he has in
                    mind when reading a book [<a class="ref" href="#jannidis2004">Jannidis 2004</a>, 185]. Categories
                    describing general aspects of literary characters form the main classes of the
                    ontology, e.g. inner and outer features, actions on other characters and
                    objects. In this contribution, characters are regarded as individual objects,
                    which are not linked to roles or archetypes [<a class="ref" href="#propp1968">Propp 1968</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#greimas1971">Greimas 1971</a>]. Asking what a character means to a reader means not
                    what kind of characters we have, but what general structure and attributes a
                    character has. We regard a character as a complex cognitive entity in the
                    reader’s mind, rather than emphasizing metaphors or archetypes. In this
                    contribution, approaches that separate characters by roles, genres, etc., are
                    fazed out, because they might superimpose literary criticism on the daily
                    phenomenon of reading literature. Reading literature and understanding
                    characters does not necessarily require that everyone be a scholar in literature
                    studies. It is of interest how a normal person as well as a scholar describes a
                    character. By using a hierarchy, individual descriptions of characters should
                    get a common ground to comparing these descriptions. By using sub classes,
                    categories can subsume features of special characters or groups of characters.
                    In addition, so-called instances of the classes represent individual and
                    explicit objects of the domain of literary characters. Here, direct information
                    about a character given in a text is assigned to an instance. Together with the
                    information of the class hierarchy and other instances, a single mental
                    representation of a character is modelled (cf. <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). In this
                    approach, individual description, the pre-step of interpretation, is focused.
                    Finding the same patterns revealed in different descriptions might be regarded
                    as a common sense. By analysing these, similarities based on the cultural
                    background of readers or of writing and reading traditions might be found. A
                    more detailed description of this ontology is given in [<a class="ref" href="#zw2006a">Zöllner-Weber 2006</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#zw2006b">Zöllner-Weber &amp; Witt 2006</a>].</div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000068/resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000068/resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt="Graphic representation of the information structure of a&#xA;                    character."/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>Scheme of the representation structure of a character in the ontology.

                    information. This means implicit information is derived from explicit
                    information. In formal logic, given information is called assumption; the
                    operation is called conclusion. The methods induction [<a class="ref" href="#charniak1985">Charniak &amp; McDermott 1985</a>, 22] and deduction [<a class="ref" href="#charniak1985">Charniak &amp; McDermott 1985</a>, 14] are subsumed under the term of logic reasoning. Induction means inferring from special concepts to general concepts whereas deduction constitutes the opposite process from general concepts to special ones. Here, the conclusions can only receive the values true or false. The assumptions of the induction have to be true so that a conclusion can be constituted as true as well. The conclusion is called an inference.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Logic reasoning is one possible application for ontologies. It is probably
                    helpful (i) to check consistency during ontology development, (ii) to enable
                    semi-automatic merging of (domain) ontologies as well as (iii) to deduce hidden
                    information contained in the ontology. These three tasks can be applied to all
                    elements of ontologies, classes as well as instances. As Baader et al. mention,
                    logic reasoning can fulfill different purposes in the phase of creating an
                    ontology and in the phase of using it <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#baader2003a">#baader2003a</a></span>, e.g. investigating the structure of categories/ concepts, or testing if every object is used in the intended and not contradictory way. In different situations of a work process, logic reasoning can be used to avoid or to solve problems: If several persons build together an ontology, new included elements can be checked for inconsistency or redundant information can be detected.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Coming back to the mentioned mapping processes, one can state that for the ontology of literary characters, it might be useful, if two persons add categories with the same or similar meaning to the ontology, to produce suggestions for mapping. Applications like mapping or merging are useful for the development and usage of ontologies. But recently, to the author's knowledge, there have been no other ontologies in literature studies which deal with literary characters or narratology and which could be related to this ontology, i.e. by merging or mapping. To be successful, synonymy has to be taken into account and a relating mechanism has to be implemented, because processing of synonymy is not included directly in an ontology so far. Therefore, these tasks cannot be applied completely to the ontology for literary characters at the moment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">Especially in the humanities, where textual data is often crucial, applications
                    can be used which combine ontologies with text annotations or information
                    retrieval. Ontologies consist of information, ideas, and/or facts, which also
                    occur or are repeated in (text) sources that are not included in an ontology.
                    This might be especially interesting when dealing with ontology learning. For
                    example, terms contained in both sources, in text annotations/web pages and an
                    ontology <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#baader2003a">#baader2003a</a></span> can be queried for. But here
                    arises the question of whether arranging data that both sources can match would
                    be a redundant and time-consuming work. In addition, setting up more elaborate
                    match processes could require a complex system including lexica or external
                    rules [<a class="ref" href="#puppe2000">Puppe et al. 2000</a>, 635–6], [<a class="ref" href="#benjamins1999">Benjamins et al. 1999</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Nevertheless, logic reasoning is not only useful for such processes.

For example, a user wants to retrieve every instance with the name of a given author in its property. Information can be filtered.

                standard, has to be transformed into the programmes’ own representation in advance. 
                Additionally, a possible user has to be familiar with the concepts of an ontology to

It is questionable if these skills can be a requirement for a scholar with traditional education in literature studies without proper training. In summary, both programs are reasonable for inference tasks with ontologies in humanities. Both have advantages and disadvantages, especially formulating queries seem to be difficult. SWI-Prolog might be a choice since complete scripts can be executed. On the other hand, Racer provides a graphical representation of ontologies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">As mentioned, an ontology consists of a set of objects, concepts, and further

                Additionally, instances of the classes represent individual objects of the selected
                domain. By relating main classes and more specialised ones of an ontology, a
                hierarchy can be created. Therefore, only information in a hierarchical order can be
                modelled using an ontology. Similarities between concepts or classes commonly

                directly by an ontology. However, there exist certain structures within the OWL
                languages that allow for such relations. But these relations have to be modelled
                explicitly during the creation of the ontology. Concerning the description of
                literary characters as in this work, theories which tend to have a hierarchical
                structure for describing the characters as Nieragden [<a class="ref" href="#nieragden1995">Nieragden 1995</a>] should be included. Theories that are based more on network-like structures, however, should be modeled using topic maps or similar techniques, for example.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">Besides this disadvantage, one has also to note that vague information can be handled by the ontology through the instantiation of a class. While the class describes the more general and common agreed on concept, the instance refers to a concrete example, also including possible individual interpretations. This kind of modelling has been used for the ontology of literary characters.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">In principle, drawing inferences can retrieve implicit and hidden information. The
                structure of OWL DL allows logic and formal applications, but the scope of the
                logic-based queries is often restricted. Since the logic theorem is based on the
                closed world assumption, only information already included in a fact base can be
                returned. Mostly the implicit information that possibly exists in an ontology is
                anchored in the hierarchical relations between the classes and between classes and
                instances. Furthermore, the employed logical concept in description logics only can
                give back true or false conclusions (or the elements of the fact base that match a
                true result). However, when it is queried for vague information (not modelled via
                certain similarity constructs as explained before) this approach will fail since
                they cannot be expressed in logical terms [<a class="ref" href="#berthold2003">Berthold 2003</a>].
                Furthermore, such information is often ambiguous, or even contradictory [<a class="ref" href="#zw2008">Zöllner-Weber &amp; Apollon 2008</a>]. Here, fuzzy logics or statistically methods might be
                superior. In computer science, many approaches combine logic reasoning with other
                methods of information retrieval to overcome the limits of logics. Logical queries
                are often embedded in systems, which contain further sources like lexica to extract
                more information e.g. ontology learning <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#cimiano2006">#cimiano2006</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">More generally, when comparing literature studies and computer systems, one has to
                take into account that semantics in literature studies often do not match semantics
                in machine-to-machine learning [<a class="ref" href="#veltman2004">Veltman 2004</a>]. Often, technical, e.g.
                machine-to-machine, semantics are more flat and not too complex, whereas in
                literature semantics could be highly complex. As an example in the present work, the
                description of the literary characters is dependent on the reader’s interpretation.
                Therefore, the modelling of the ontology must allow for several interpretations
                side-by-side in the ontology (via instantiations). This is also covered in [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2005">McCarty 2005</a>], where he points out that proper modelling in humanities is important and that the model has to be kept open or flexible, i.e. to be able to include the thinking itself. 
                Furthermore, one has to note that the foundations i.e. the literary theories of
                character descriptions, on which the ontology is built on, mainly have hierarchical
                character and thus, are more advantageous for the proposed task. Nevertheless, also
                the structure of a hierarchy is critical. Shirky notes that hierarchies are usually
                built on a single world-view <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#shirky2005">#shirky2005</a></span>. But mostly the weighting or the level of
                detail within different branches in the hierarchy is influenced by the modeller or
                by economical aspects.  Therefore, the hierarchy might not be objective. This might
                not be a problem for machine-based processing; however, a user of this ontology might not agree on the presented hierarchy. This risks that the provided system will be abandoned by the user.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusion and Outlook</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">In this article, we evaluated approaches using logic reasoning applied to an ontology for literary characters. The inference tool Racer and the programming language Prolog were tested and compared to see if they can serve as a computer assisted approach in this scenario.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">Both offer options to draw inferences, but the usage requests a good comprehension of
                logics. In addition, intuitive and individual queries are also difficult to produce
                with solely logic constructs. Furthermore, the hierarchy model of an ontology might
                often not be suitable for certain topics in literature studies.  For example,
                strands of plots that evolve over time cannot be represented by using a hierarchy.
                For such analysis, other approaches are more suitable (for example [<a class="ref" href="#meister1999">Meister 1999</a>]). One should also keep in mind that information in
                humanities is often vague, ambiguous, or even contradictory. An example of such a
                situation is given by the relations between language and the world in Ludwig
                Wittgenstein’s philosophical work <cite class="title italic">Tractatus</cite>. If trying
                to model these by an ontology (hierarchy), the author was faced by the fact that the
                hierarchy changes during the progress of Wittgenstein’s approach [<a class="ref" href="#zw2007b">Zöllner-Weber &amp; Pichler 2007</a>]. However, a model represented by an ontology remains static. Solving such problems by logic reasoning which is simply based on true or false conclusions will become challenging and might exceed the limits of logic reasoning.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">Nevertheless, the potential of logic reasoning for literature should be explored. It is helpful in the different phases of the creation and deployment of ontologies in the humanities and its sub disciplines like literature studies. For example, when different experts are working on the same ontology, its consistency can be checked and errors can be minimised in an early state of an ontology.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">Probably, when dealing with such information and logic systems, Fuzzy Logic should be
                considered [<a class="ref" href="#halpern2005">Halpern 2005</a>]. It offers a range of values that weight a
                conclusion rather than a binary decision as the logics described in this
                contribution. Also, combinations with other types of systems, like additional knowledge bases, might support current ontology approaches in humanities and literature studies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53">At the moment, to the author’s knowledge, only few such approaches, especially in
                    literature studies, have been published. Therefore, a general judgement about
                    the value of computer-aided approaches as outlined in this contribution could
                    not be demonstrated to its limits. Existing approaches (for example [<a class="ref" href="#farrar2002">Farrar et al. 2002</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#lungen2007">Lüngen 2007</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#zw2006b">Zöllner-Weber &amp; Witt 2006</a>]) show promising results in modelling information in humanities. Therefore, further research should be directed to make ontologies and further approaches like logic reasoning even more popular and applicable in the humanities and literature studies.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Appendix</h1><div id="table1" class="table"><table class="table"><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Query for instance class relation:</td><td valign="top" class="cell">rdf(INSTANCE,'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
