            Digital Literary Studies</cite>, Stephen Ramsay argues that efforts to legitimate
                humanities computing within the larger discipline of literature have met with
                resistance because well-meaning advocates have tried too hard to brand their work as
                "scientific," a word whose positivistic associations conflict with
                traditional humanistic values of ambiguity, open-endedness, and
                indeterminacy <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#ramsay2007">#ramsay2007</a></span>.  If, as Ramsay notes, the
                computer is perceived primarily as an instrument for quantizing, verifying,
                counting, and measuring, then what purpose does it serve in those disciplines
                committed to a view of knowledge that admits of no incorrigible truth somehow
                insulated from subjective interpretation and imaginative intervention <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#ramsay2007">#ramsay2007</a></span>?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Ramsay's rich and nuanced answer to that question has been formulated across two
                publications, of which "Toward an Algorithmic Criticism"
                is the earliest.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e96">[1]</a>  Drawing
                on his experience as both a programmer and a scholar, he suggests that the
                pattern-seeking behavior of the literary critic is often amenable to computational
                modeling.  But while Ramsay is interested in exposing the algorithmic aspects of
                literary methods, he concedes that in searching for historical antecedents, we may
                be more successful locating them in the cultural and creative practices of antiquity
                rather than in scholarly and critical practices [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2003">Ramsay 2003</a>, 170].  His insight is born of the fact
                that a text is a dynamic system whose individual units are ripe for rule-governed
                alteration.  While these alterations may be greatly facilitated by mechanical means,
                historically they have been performed manually, as in the case of the
                "stochastic" aesthetics of the <cite class="title italic">I Ching</cite>
                or the "generative aesthetics" of the Dadaists and Oulipo [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2003">Ramsay 2003</a>, 170]. "Ironically," Ramsay writes, "it is not
                        the methods of the scholar that reveal themselves as
                        'computational,' but the methods of the gematrist and the
                        soothsayer" [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2003">Ramsay 2003</a>, 170].  Ramsay's emphasis on prophecy is apt, for it allows us
                to link the divinatory offices of the poet and soothsayer with the predictive
                functions of the computer. It is interesting to note in this context that one of the
                earliest uses to which a commercial computer was put was as an engine of prediction:
                the UNIVersal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC), the first digital electronic computer to
                debut in the United States, successfully predicted the outcome of the 1952
                Eisenhower-Stevenson presidential race.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e127">[2]</a>  The computer’s pedigree in symbolic logic, model-based reasoning, and data processing make it a predictive machine <span class="hi italic">par excellence</span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">With these observations in mind, the principal purpose of this essay is to establish an ancient lineage for what we might call <em class="term">computational prediction in the humanities</em>, a lineage that runs counter to Ramsay's assertions insofar as it is distinctly critical or scholarly rather than aesthetic in character.  Specifically, I argue that within the field of textual scholarship, conjectural criticism (the reconstruction of literary texts) can be profitably understood as a sub-domain of Ramsay's algorithmic criticism (rule-governed manipulation of literary texts). The essay seeks to do the following:
            <ul class="list"><li class="item">First, it challenges the assumption that "computational
                    processes within the rich tradition of interpretive endeavors [are] usually
                    aligned <em class="emph">more with art than criticism</em>" (my
                    emphasis) [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2003">Ramsay 2003</a>, 167]. Although
                    sometimes erroneously considered "pre-interpretive,"<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e152">[3]</a> textual scholarship, one of our oldest branches of literary study, is a fundamentally critical rather than artistic endeavor.</li><li class="item">Second, I provide preliminary evidence suggesting not only a formal, but also a genealogical relationship between Mesopotamian prophecy and textual scholarship, one that sanctions a prospective as well as retrospective view of the evolution of a text.  Such a proleptic viewpoint has, in fact, already been experimentally adopted in evolutionary biology and historical linguistics, disciplines whose conjectural methods parallel those of textual scholarship (about which see below).</li><li class="item">Third, it offers an alternative theory for why the analogy between science and the digital humanities apparently has so little traction among traditional literary critics.  Ramsay's contention is that the tasks at which a computer excels are frequently judged, rightly or wrongly, to be more compatible with the certitude of hard knowledge than the incertitude of soft knowledge.  An equally compelling (and complementary) reason is that the computer is too often seen exclusively as a device for processing numbers rather than manipulating text.  But if the computer can count numbers like a mathematician, it can also play with letters in ways, as we shall see, that poets and textual scholars alike would recognize.</li><li class="item">Fourth, the essay reconfigures the relationship between humanities computing
                    and science by exploring the common denominator of literacy rather than
                    numeracy.  In other words, the essay brings into focus those scientific
                    disciplines that manipulate a symbol system that semiotically  — 
                    <em class="emph">operationally</em>, we might say  —  more closely resembles letters than numbers, namely linguistics and bioinformatics.  The essay further posits that when viewed historically, the relationship among the three disciplines isn't unidirectional, but rather deeply reciprocal.  There is compelling circumstantial evidence that the conjectural methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology were largely derived from those of textual criticism in the nineteenth century.  Subsequently, however, linguistics and biology were (and to some extent remain) more active in exploiting the computer's ability to execute algorithms on strings as a way to predict, model, and analyze evolutionary change  —  or in other words to automate the methods first expounded by textual critics more than a century earlier.</li></ul></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Broadly conceived, then, this essay re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools of reconstruction and forecasting.

The object of conjecture is notional rather than empirical; possible rather than demonstrable; counterfactual rather than real.  This subjunctive mode, I contend, is not antithetical to the humanities, but central to it.  Whether it is a student of the ancient Near East deciphering a fragmented cuneiform tablet or a musician speculatively completing Bach's unfinished final fugue or a literary scholar using advanced 3D computer modeling to virtually restore a badly damaged manuscript, the impulse in each instance  —  vital and paradoxical  —  is to go beyond purely documentary states of objects.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The essay develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports

The essay thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic expression and simulation.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In an effort to overcome common objections to analogies between the humanities and

By <em class="term">tree paradigm</em>, I mean the grouping of manuscripts, languages, or genomes into families and showing how they relate to one another in genealogical terms, and using these relationships to conjecture about lost ancestors or archetypes. My themes are the interdependence and correspondence of tree methods (and their associated algorithms) in three diverse knowledge domains. From tree structures, I turn to a form of causal transmission known as a transformation series, a recognized phenomenon in the three disciplines surveyed.  Because of their similarity to a genre of word puzzle known as doublets, transformation series allow us to revisit the connection between wordplay and divination established earlier in the argument.</div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">A Rationale for Conjecture</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">In textual scholarship, conjecture is the proposal of a reading not found in any
                extant witness to the text.  It is predicated on the idea that words are always
                signs of other words; the received text also harbors the once and future text.  When
                A. E. Housman alters a line from Catullus's <cite class="title italic">Marriage of Peleus
                and Thetis</cite> (c. 62-54 BCE) so that it reads "<span class="foreign i">Emathiae
                tutamen, Opis carissime nato</span>," instead of "<span class="foreign i">Emathiae tutamen opis, carissime nato</span>," he is practicing
                the art of conjecture.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e210">[6]</a> Housman's small orthographic tweaks produce sizable semantic
                shifts: by relocating a comma and capitalizing <span class="hi quotes">Opis</span> so that
                it is understood not as the Latin term for <span class="hi quotes">power,</span> but as the
                genitive of <span class="hi quotes">Ops,</span> the mother of Jupiter in Roman mythology, he
                substantially alters the meaning of the line: "Peleus, most dear
                to his son, is the protector of the power of Emathia," becomes "Peleus, protector of Emathia, most dear to the son of Ops
                    [Jupiter]."   The emendation, as the fictional Housman explains in Tom
                Stoppard's <cite class="title italic">The Invention of Love</cite>, restores sense to
                nonsense by ridding the language of anachronism: "How can Peleus
                    be <span class="foreign i">carrisme nato</span>, most dear to his son, when his
                    son has not yet been born?" [<a class="ref" href="#stoppard1997">Stoppard 1997</a>, 37].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Expressed in grammatical terms, conjecture operates in the subjunctive and
                conditional moods.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e244">[7]</a>  Because its range of motion extends beyond the pale of the empirical, its vocabulary is replete with <em class="emph">could</em>s, <em class="emph">might</em>s, <em class="emph">may</em>s, and <em class="emph">if</em>s.  Such a vocabulary reflects not caution — on the contrary, conjecture is a radical, audacious editorial style — but rather a refusal to settle for attested states of texts.  In this it is opposed to the current wave of archival models of editing, which, in their rejection of speculative and inferential readings, opt for representation in the indicative mood.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Conjecture has at various moments in history held a place of honor in our repertory
                of editorial paradigms.  Taken collectively, for example, Housman’s critical
                writings offer a magnificent apologia of <em class="term">divinatio</em>, as conjecture is
                still sometimes called.  The strength of conviction, the peremptory eloquence, the
                sheer depth and breadth of knowledge contained in those pages brook no protests
                about the bugbear of intentionalist editing or the death of the author.  But at the
                same time, conjecture is a foundling, strangely lacking a well-defined history,
                theory, methodology.  Discussion of it, which more often than not occurs
                incidentally, tends to take place not on an expository or historical plane, but on a
                homiletic or poetic one.  Thus, for example, amid all his scientific discourse on
                compounded variational formulas, ancestral groups, successive derivation, and other
                arcane topics pertaining to recension, W. W. Greg falls almost quiet when he turns to the subject of conjecture: "the fine flower" of textual criticism he calls it, choosing metaphor over definition [<a class="ref" href="#greg1924">Greg 1924</a>].  Treatments of conjecture characterized more by brevity than rigor are the norm: the process is hazily glossed metaphorically or else grounded in the successful critic’s abstract qualities of mind, which do not always lend themselves to analysis (e.g., intuition, judgment, confidence, insight, authority, charisma).  For these reasons, conjecture has customarily been seen as either a practitioner’s art, the conspicuous absence of a meta-literature a symptom of the bottom-up approach it tends to favor, or a prophet’s.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The scholarly language can at times suggest the intervention of a supernatural agent.
                The classicist Robin Nisbet speaks of a "Muse of Textual Conjecture,"
                whom he playfully christens, appropriately enough,
                Eustochia.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e282">[8]</a>  As one response to the exquisitely difficult
                recovery mission that conjecture sets for its critics, Eustochia might be perceived
                as a sad contrivance to a misguided endeavor; a <em class="emph">deus ex machina</em> called
                in to artificially resolve all textual difficulties.  But consider, for a moment,
                the bleak alternative: a world in which conjectural knowledge never was or could be
                an article of faith.  Samuel Johnson’s plaintive verdict that conjecture "demands more than humanity possesses" [<a class="ref" href="#johnson1765">Johnson 1765</a>] gives our

                criticism, and its practice?  E. J. Kenney’s position (which he officially co-opts
                from the nineteenth-century critic Boeckh, but which nevertheless seems to be
                prevalent among Classical editors) that the solution to the more "difficult
                cases" of conjecture "comes in a flash or not at
                all" [<a class="ref" href="#kenney1974">Kenney 1974</a>, 147] is tantalizing, but the idea of a
                lucid eureka moment  —  eerily similar to the
                romantic notion of inspired creativity ("At its
                    inception, a [romantic] poem is an involuntary and unanticipated
                    donnée" [<a class="ref" href="#abrams1953">Abrams 1953</a>, 24])  —  shouldn’t curtail discussion; it should open the floodgates.  And because the archival model holds conjecture in abeyance, an entire new generation of young textual critics who have cut their critical teeth on documentary precepts are all but forbidden at the outset to engage in it.  For this reason alone conjectural criticism should inspire inquiry, but also precisely because it pretends to elude historical, cognitive, or technical understanding.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Would it be possible for conjecture to assume again a position of prominence in
                editorial theory?  It would take a concerted inquiry into history, method, and
                theory.  We would need to seriously engage the psychology of intuition, the AI and cognitive literature of inference, and the history of conjecture as divinatory art and scientific inquiry.  We would need to keep apace with advancements in historical linguistics and evolutionary biology (two fields whose relevance to textual criticism is vastly under-appreciated) and the burgeoning psycholinguistic literature of reading.  Indeed, we would reap many rewards from outreach to the linguistic community.  We would need to dispel the myth that conjecture is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.  A curriculum for conjecture would give us better insight into the method underlying the prediction — or retrodiction — of ancient readings of texts.  Not least, we would need to work decisively to bring conjectural criticism into the 21st century.  Because it has traditionally been described as a balm to help heal a maimed or corrupted text, conjecture is in desperate need of a facelift; the washed-up pathological metaphors long ago ceased to strike a chord in editorial theory.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">So what would an alternate language of conjecture sound like?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">We might, for starters, imagine conjecture as a knowledge toolkit designed to perform "what if" analyses across a range of texts.  In this view, the text is a semiotic system whose discrete units of information can be artfully manipulated into alternate configurations that may represent past or future states.  Of course the computing metaphors alone are not enough; they must be balanced by, among other things, an appreciation of the imponderable and distinctly human qualities that contribute to conjectural knowledge.  But formalized and integrated into a curriculum, the various suggestions outlined here have the potential to give conjecture a new lease on life and incumbent editorial practices  —  much too conservative for a new generation of textual critics  —  a run for their money.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">A Formal Definition and Methodological Overview</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">What do I mean by conjecture, then?  Giovanni Manetti's pithy definition — "inference to the imperceptible" — is good insofar as it captures
                the cognitive leap ("inference") from the known to the unknown.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e335">[9]</a> But
                it fails to denote the temporal dimension of conjecture so essential to a field like
                textual criticism, which deals with copies of texts that are produced in succession
                and ordered in time.  Moreover, <em class="term">inference</em> is not a monolithic category
                but can be further subdivided into inductive inference, deductive inference,
                abductive, intuitive, probabilistic, logical, etc.  Manetti's definition thus needs
                to be massaged into something more apropos to textual scholarship.  For the purposes
                of this essay, I'll define it as follows: conjecture is <em class="emph">allographic inference to
                past or future values of the sign</em>.  <em class="term">Allographic</em> is a semiotic term
                given currency by the analytic philosopher Nelson Goodman in his seminal <cite class="title italic">Languages of Art</cite> and refers
                to those media that resolve into discrete, abstract units of information — into what
                might be more loosely called <em class="term">digital units</em> — that can be systematically
                copied, transmitted, added to, subtracted from, transposed, substituted, and
                otherwise manipulated.  Conjecture as it is understood in this work is indifferent
                as to whether the mode of allographic manipulation is manual, cognitive, or
                mechanical. Allographic contrasts with autographic, or continuous, media.  Examples
                of the former include musical scores, alphabetic script, pixels, and numerical
                notation; examples of the latter, paintings, drawings, and engravings.  Painter and
                theorist Julian Bell summarizes Goodman like this: "Pictures
                    differ from other sign systems, such as writing, by being continuities in which
                    every mark is interdependent, rather than operating through a combination of
                    independent markers like the alphabet.  (In computational terminology, they are
                    'analog' rather than 'digital'
                    representations.)" [<a class="ref" href="#bell1999">Bell 1999</a>, 228]. Words are conventionally allographic, images autographic, though much important work in recent years has contested the validity of these distinctions and examined borderline cases, such as pattern poetry.  Indeed, the last two decades of textual criticism have witnessed a wealth of scholarship promoting the text's bibliographic or iconic codes.  Despite the virtues of such visual approaches to textuality (and there are many), conjectural criticism has been hamstrung by their success. The general argument in this essay is that conjecture flourishes in an allographic environment, not an autographic one.  By "allographic inference," then, I mean <em class="emph">the considered manipulation or processing of digital signs with the goal of either recovering a prior configuration or predicting a future or potential one</em>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">If we set aside for a moment the original terms of my definition (<em class="term">allographic
            inference</em>) and focus instead on the terms used to gloss them (<em class="term">digital
            processing</em>), then one of the salient points to emerge is that conjecture as
                formalized in these pages is semiotic in the first instance and computational in the
                second. Conjecture, that is to say, involves digital signal processing or, to use
                the more general-purpose term, <em class="term">computation</em>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e397">[10]</a>  Moreover, just as digitality, as a concept, extends beyond the boxy electronic machines that sit on our desktops, so too does computation.  As David Alan Grier reminds us in <cite class="title italic">When Computers Were Human</cite>, homo sapiens has been computing on clay tablets, papyrus, parchment, and paper for millennia [<a class="ref" href="#grier2005">Grier 2005</a>]. A <em class="term">computer</em> is simply someone or something that systematically manipulates discrete, abstract symbols.  As conventionally understood, those symbols are numbers, and the manipulations performed on them are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.   But computers are text manipulators as much as number crunchers.  The subfield of computer science that operates on textual rather than numeric data is known as <em class="term">stringology</em>.  Reflecting this broader emphasis, the symbols that are the focus of this essay are primarily alphabetic, but also phonemic and molecular.  The only criterion for the symbols to function conjecturally, as already stated in our definition, is that they be digital, or allographic. The processes discussed here and throughout likewise depart from computational norms.  They are not always or only mathematical operations, but also semiotic or grammar-like operations: transposition, deletion, insertion, substitution, repetition, and relocation. I will have more to say about them later, but for now let me summarize the four poles around which string computation has been organized in this project:

                whether human or mechanical, as a "computer."  From this standpoint,
                divination is not "knowledge in advance of fact" 
                so much as knowledge that is a (computational) permutation of fact [<a class="ref" href="#jones1948">Jonese 1948</a>, 27].  Justin Rye, for
                example, author of the imaginary language "Futurese," a projection of

                will be pronounced /bIl/ in some American dialects within a century or more as a
                consequence of consonant cluster simplification [<a class="ref" href="#rye2003">Rye 2003</a>]. Underlying this speculation is a simple deletion operation that has been applied to a factual state of a word to compute a plausible future state.  Transition rules of this kind are key ingredients in all of the examples of conjecture discussed in this project: the wordplay of Shakespeare's fools, soothsayers, and madmen; the puns of the Mesopotamian or Mayan priest; the "emendations" of textual scholars; the doublets of Lewis Carroll; the molecular reconstructions of geneticists; the projections of conlangers (creators of imaginary languages); the transformation series of historical linguists, textual scholars, and evolutionary biologists.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">These devices and systems are unified by their semiotic and, in some cases, cognitive
                properties and behaviors: a pun resembles an editorial reconstruction resembles a speech error resembles a genetic mutation, and so forth.  Each of these transitive relations is explored in the course of this essay.  Consider, as a preliminary example, the analogy between textual and genetic variation.  It is the allographic equivalence between the two — the fact that both are digitally encoded — that makes possible a strong theory of translation, allowing one system to be encoded into the other and, once encoded, to continue to change and evolve in its new state.  Brazilian-born artist Eduardo Kac, who coined the term <em class="term">transgenic art</em> to describe his experiments with genetic engineering, exploits this allographic equivalence in <cite class="title italic">Genesis</cite> (1999), a commissioned work for the Ars Electronica exhibition.  Kac's artist statement reads in part as follows: 
                <blockquote><p>The key element of the work is an "artist's
                gene," a synthetic gene that was created by Kac by translating a sentence
                    from the biblical book of Genesis into Morse Code, and converting the Morse Code
                    into DNA base pairs according to a conversion principle specially developed by
                    the artist for this work. The sentence reads: "Let man have
                        dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
                        every living thing that moves upon the earth." It was chosen for what it implies about the dubious notion of divinely sanctioned humanity's supremacy over nature. The Genesis gene was incorporated into bacteria, which were shown in the gallery. Participants on the Web could turn on an ultraviolet light in the gallery, causing real, biological mutations in the bacteria. This changed the biblical sentence in the bacteria. The ability to change the sentence is a symbolic gesture: it means that we do not accept its meaning in the form we inherited it, and that new meanings emerge as we seek to change it. [<a class="ref" href="#kac1999">Kac 1999</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Kac’s elaborate game of code-switching is enabled by what Matthew Kirschenbaum calls

                Shakespeare as a graduate student.  The ludic language of Shakespeare's fools,
                soothsayers, and madmen seemed to me to uncannily resemble the language of
                Shakespeare's editors as they juggled and transposed letters in the margins of the
                page, trying to discover proximate words that shadow those that have actually
                descended to us in the hopes of recovering an authorial text.  The pleasure George
                Ian Duthie, a postwar editor of Shakespeare, shows in permutating
                variants — juxtaposing and repeating them, taking a punster's delight in the
                homophony of stockt, struckt, and struck; hare and hart; nough and
                nought<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e497">[12]</a> — finds its poetic complement in the metaplasmic imagination of
                Tom O'Bedlam in <cite class="title italic">King Lear</cite> or the soothsayer Philarmonus
                in <cite class="title italic">Cymbeline</cite>.  Kenneth Gross points to what he calls
                Tom's "near echolalia" on the heath in the storm scene,
                the "strange, homeless babble" that "presses up from within Tom's lists, in their jamming up and
                    disjunctions of sense, their isolation of bits of language[:] . . .

                something scribal and exegetical in Tom's babble, just as there is something poetic
                and ludic in Duthie's editing.  And in the way both manipulate signs, there is also
                something fundamentally conjectural.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e520">[13]</a>  Conjecture, then, can be profitably understood by adopting a semiotic framework  —  expressed here in computational terms  —  within which we can legitimately or persuasively correlate the rules and patterns of conjectural transformation with those of mantic codes and wordplay.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">Consider, too, the soothsayer Philarmonus, solicited by Posthumus near the close of

                3.5.41.  And so can every prophet.  What the incident in <cite class="title italic">Cymbeline</cite> highlights is that the "capaciousness of ear" with which Kenneth Gross
                attributes Hamlet applies in equal measure to Shakespeare’s soothsayers, clowns,

                significant, for example, that Posthumus should initially mistake Jupiter’s oracle

                common register.  The fool, too, engages in the same digital remixing of sound and
                sense, and it is worth recalling in this context that Enid Welsford’s classic study
                of the fool’s social and literary history devotes an entire chapter to his dual role

                <cite class="title italic">Twelfth Night</cite>, for example, is fluent in the dialect of

In the following exchange with Viola, the bawdy and jocular terms in which Feste expresses this philosophy should not distract us from the radical theory of the sign that underpins it: that there exists an instrumental link between signifier and signified, such that reconfiguring the one provides a means for fashioning, shaping, or foreshadowing the destiny of the other:

                power to pervert the world by deforming ("dallying with") the language used to
                signify it.  But Shakespeare mobilizes other meanings as well. In the domain of
                textual scholarship, the term <em class="term">corrupt</em> has historically been used to
                describe a text riddled with copy errors.  Because Feste’s cunning mispronunciations
                and nonsense words hover between intelligibility and unintelligibility, they closely
                parallel scribal error: "I did impeticos thy
                gratillity" (2.3.27), Feste nonsensically proclaims to Sir
                Andrew, prompting one critic to wryly note that "words here are
                    at liberty and have little meaning apart from that which editors, at the cost of
                    great labor, finally manage to impose upon them" [<a class="ref" href="#grivelet1956">Grivelet 1956</a>, 71].  The "great
                    labor" to which Michel Grivelet alludes involves exploiting the
                digitally encoded phonological structure of language to conjecturally recover
                authentic words from corrupt ones: <em class="term">petticoat</em> from

                disfigured puns seem to compress temporality, exposing what the linguist D. Stein
                would call "diachronic vectors in synchrony."<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e742">[15]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Let me pause here to gather together a number of threads: my central tenet is that the linguistic procedures of Shakespeare's editors often seem to mimic those of Shakespeare's most inveterate "computers" of language. To emend a text — to insert, delete, and rearrange letters, phonemes, or sequences of words — is to ritualistically invoke a divinatory tradition of wordplay that dates back to at least the third millennium BC.  For a benign alien power observing human textual rites from afar, the linguistic manipulations of a Duthie or a Housman would, I imagine, be for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from those of a Philarmonus or Feste or Tom O’Bedlam or Chaldean or, for that matter, a computer programmer using string-rewriting rules to transform one word into another. What all these examples have in common are digital units manipulated by computers (programmers, soothsayers, madmen, fools, punsters, poets, scribes, editors) using a small set of combinatorial procedures (insertion, deletion, transposition, substitution, relocation) for conjectural, predictive, or divinatory ends. Duthie and Tom O'Bedlam, computer programmers and Kabbalists, Philarmonus and historical linguists: they all compute bits of language.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">As an editorial method, such alphabetic computation is dismissed by Housman as a wanton orthographic game.  Finding a kindred spirit in a nineteenth-century German predecessor, he approvingly quotes the following:
                <blockquote><p>Some people, if they see that anything in an ancient text wants
                    correcting, immediately betake themselves to the art of palaeography . . . and
                    try one dodge after another, as if it were a game, until they hit upon something
                    which they think they can substitute for the corruption; as if forsooth truth
                    were generally discovered by shots of that sort, or as if emendation could take
                    its rise from anything but a careful consideration of the
                    thought. (<a href="#housman1921">Qtd. in Housman 1921.</a>)</p></blockquote>
                And yet the conjectures of, for example, Richard Bentley (1662-1742), one of the few
                textual critics for whom Housman professes admiration, are as much the product of
                letter play and combinatorial art as they are of careful deliberation and thought.
                (Given the structure and workings of the mental lexicon, discussed below, we might
                reasonably assert that letter play is the 
                  <span class="foreign i">sine qua non</span> of conjectural thought.) Lamenting the corrupt state of the blind Milton's <cite class="title italic">Paradise Lost</cite>, which, according to Bentley, was not only
                dictated to a tone-deaf amanuensis, but also, adding insult to injury, later
                copy-edited by a derelict acquaintance, Bentley attaches a preface to his edition of
                the poem that includes a table of the "monstrous Faults" disfiguring
                the masterpiece, alongside Bentley's proposed emendations [<a class="ref" href="#bentley1732">Bentley 1732</a>]. Reflecting the editor's
                conviction that "Words of a like or near Sound in
                Pronunciation" were substituted throughout for what Milton
                intended [<a class="ref" href="#bentley1732">Bentley 1732</a>], the table reads like a dictionary of wordplay: 
                "is Judicious" is emended to "Unlibidinous";
                "Nectarous" to "Icarus"; "Subtle Art"
                to "Sooty Chark"; "Wound" to "Stound";
                "Angelic" to "Adamic."<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e807">[16]</a>  The same "near echolalia" that characterizes Tom O'Bedlam's speech in the storm scene also characterizes Bentley's editorial method.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">To adjudicate among variants, Bentley finds evidence and inspiration in diverse
                knowledge domains.  Milton's "<em class="emph">secret</em> top of
                Horeb" in the opening lines of <cite class="title italic">Paradise Lost</cite>
                is conjecturally restored to "sacred top" through an
                appeal to literary tradition, geology, meteorology, and logic.  According to
                Bentley, "secret top" finds little precedent in the works
                of antiquity, while "sacred top" has parallels in the
                Bible, Spenser, and various classical authors [<a class="ref" href="#bentley1732">Bentley 1732</a>, 1n6]. Emending a text by bringing it into alignment with literary antecedents is a technique in which Bentley takes recourse again and again, as though a poem were best thought of as a commonplace book filled with its author's favorite quotations.   The model of authorship that underwrites this approach is one that stresses sampling and collage over originality and solitary genius.  The more allusive and intertextual the work, the more susceptible it will be to conjectural reconstruction.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">Whatever the shortcomings of Bentley's appeal to precedent, it has the effect of helping systemize and guide his wordplay.  His paronomastic methods are constrained by other factors as well: the double articulation of natural language, comprised of a first level of meaningful units (called morphemes) and a second level of meaningless units (called phonemes), imposes order and rules on the process.  There are in English a total of twenty-six letters of the alphabet capable of representing some 40-45 separate phonemes, and phonotactic and semantic constraints on how those letters and sounds may be combined.  The sequence "ptk" in English, for example, is unpronounceable, and the sequence "paf," while pronounceable, is at the time of this writing meaningless, except perhaps as an acronym.  Bentley's wordplay is thus bounded by the formal and historically contingent properties of the natural language with which he works, properties that theoretically prevent his substitutions and transpositions from degenerating into mere gibberish.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">The importance of digital or allographic units to computation, as I have defined it

                "<em class="emph">bits</em> of language" (my emphasis).  Likewise,
                Elizabeth Sewell repeatedly emphasizes that nonsense poetry and wordplay require
                "the divisibility of its material into ones, units from which a
                    universe can be built" [<a class="ref" href="#sewell1952">Sewell 1952</a>, 53]. She goes on to say that this universe
                "must never be more than the sum of its parts, and must never
                    fuse into some all-embracing whole which cannot be broken down again into the
                    original ones.  It must try to create with words a universe that consists of
                    <em class="emph">bits</em>" (my emphasis) [<a class="ref" href="#sewell1952">Sewell 1952</a>, 53–4]. It is precisely the fusion of parts into an indivisible whole that has made pictures — particularly dense, mimetic pictures — historically and technologically resistant to manual computation and, by extension, conjectural reconstruction.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Textual Transmission as Wordplay</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">The similarities between scribal and poetic computation (understood in the sense in

                attempted to ascertain whether a particular verbal crux is a poetic device in need

                "solid," one that also plays on "sullied," or, more

Wordplay, one might conclude, is a poetics of error.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">Cognitive evidence supports this view.  Clinical experiments, slips of the tongue,
                slips of the pen, and the speech and writing disorders of aphasics (those whose
                ability to produce and process language has been severely impaired by a brain
                injury) all provide insight into the structure and organization of the mental
                lexicon.  Current research models that lexicon as a web whose connections are both
                acoustic and semantic: like-sounding and like-meaning words are either stored or
                linked together in the brain [<a class="ref" href="#aitchison2003">Aitchison 2003</a>].
                These networks of relation make certain kinds of slips or errors more probable than
                others.  As natural language users, for example, we sometimes miss a target word
                when speaking or writing and instead replace it with one that occupies a nearby
                node, making substitutions like <em class="emph">profession</em> for <em class="emph">procession</em> or <em class="emph">medication</em> for
                <em class="emph">meditation</em> relatively common [<a class="ref" href="#aitchison2003">Aitchison 2003</a>, 145]. Transpositions like
                <em class="emph">pasghetti</em> for <em class="emph">spaghetti</em> or blends like <em class="emph">frowl</em> (<em class="emph">frown</em> plus <em class="emph">scowl</em>) are also legion and
                suggest that the unit of production and manipulation is the individual phoneme or
                grapheme: discrete, digital, and mobile [<a class="ref" href="#aitchison2003">Aitchison 2003</a>, 216]. For many
                aphasics, these errors completely overtake normal speech: clip might become plick;
                butter, tubber; or leasing, ceiling [<a class="ref" href="#aitchison2003">Aitchison 2003</a>, 22]. As Jean Aitchison
                observes, "the problems of aphasic patients are simply an
                    exaggeration of the difficulties which normal speakers may
                    experience" [<a class="ref" href="#aitchison2003">Aitchison 2003</a>, 22].  But what is uncontrollable in the
                aphasic is deliberate in the poet.  "There is a sense in which a
                    great poet or punster is a human being able to induce and select from a Wernicke
                    aphasia," writes George Steiner in <cite class="title italic">After
                        Babel</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#steiner1998">Steiner 1998</a>, 297]. To which I would add: or from everyday speech and writing errors.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">Steiner’s insight repays further attention.  Poets, like artists in general, often creatively stress-test the system or medium with which they work, probing its edges, overloading it, and pushing it beyond normal operational capacity.  Discovering where language breaks down or deviates from regular use is the business of both poet and neuroscientist, providing a means of gaining insight into the mechanisms of language perception, processing, and production.  But whereas the neuroscientist gathers data from aphasic patients in a clinical setting, the poet becomes, as it were, his own research subject, artificially manipulating the cognitive networks of meaning and sound that form his dataset.  As Steiner notes, when intentionally created, ordered, and embedded in larger textual or linguistic structures, such distortions become poetry.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Divination as Wordplay</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">The mantic wordplay in Shakespeare's <cite class="title italic">Cymbeline</cite> has

                classification based on phylogenetic relationships in evolutionary groups of
                organisms.  Over the last several decades, cladistics has become a highly
                sophisticated computer-assisted methodology, one that has outpaced stemmatics and
                its linguistic counterpart technically if not conceptually.  It is unsurprising,
                then, that in addition to satisfying a general theoretical curiosity about the
                coincidence of trees of history in three seemingly disparate fields, O’Hara’s
                research is also an outreach project.  He has, for example, collaborated with Peter
                Robinson to produce cladistic analyses of Chaucerian manuscripts [<a class="ref" href="#ohara1993">O'Hara and Robinson 1993</a>, 53–74]. Such outreach has awakened both textual critics and linguists to the application of bioinformatics to their respective fields.  But while O'Hara triangulates all three historical sciences, the link between textual scholarship and linguistics receives comparatively less attention than the links each of them shares with evolutionary biology.  It is this third leg of the triangle that I want first to consider.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">The evidence suggesting a direct historical relationship between stemmatics in
                textual criticism and the comparative method in linguistics is relatively hard to
                come by in the secondary literature, and what little of it there is, is
                circumstantial.  The English-language textual scholarship has almost nothing to say
                on the subject,<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1223">[26]</a> although I suspect the situation with respect to German-language
                scholarship may be different, and the linguistic and biological literature for the
                most part falls in step.  Standard accounts of the comparative method, as the
                genealogical approach is known in historical linguistics, are more apt to note the
                influence of Darwinian principles than textual ones.  But a small cadre of linguists
                and biologists, following the lead of the late Henry Hoenigswald, have set about
                revising what we think we know about tree visualizations in the nineteenth
                century.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1229">[27]</a>
                Hoenigswald, a historical linguist as well as a historian <em class="emph">of</em>
                linguistics, has managed to unearth interesting connections by operating at a
                granular level of analysis.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1237">[28]</a> He succeeds where others fail because he has something of a detective mentality about him: his work demonstrates that to successfully trace the itinerary of ideas, one sometimes has to be willing to track the movements of the individuals who propagated them.  Who knew who when, where, and under what circumstances?  His lesson is that it is useful to think in terms of coteries and their membership if the objective is to map the spread of ideas.  While other scholars write very generally about the diffusion of the arboreal trope in the nineteenth century, Hoenigswald — and perhaps we see the imprint of the genealogical method here — attempts to discover direct lines of influence.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">Any account of the origins of the comparative method in historical linguistics must
                take into account the achievements of A. Schleicher (1821-1868), the founding father
                of the <cite class="title italic">Stambaumtheorie</cite>, or genealogical tree model, by
                which the relations of the variously known IndoEuropean languages were set forth in
                a pedigree, and an asterisked hypothetical ancestral form postulated. 
                <em class="term">Comparative method</em> is a misnomer to the extent that it suggests
                comparison is the focal activity of the method, when in fact it is more like a means
                to an end.  Comparisons of variants between two or more related languages are
                undertaken with the purpose of <em class="emph">reconstructing</em> their genealogy and
                proto-language.  While the method is partially indebted to the Linnean taxonomic
                classification system, Hoenigswald is quick to point out a second, perhaps more
                significant influence: as a student, Schleicher studied classics under Friedrich
                Ritschl (1806-1876), who, along with other nineteenth-century figures such as Karl Lachmann and J. N. Madvig, helped formalize the science of stemmatology [<a class="ref" href="#hoenigswald1963">Hoenigswald 1963</a>, 5]. The affinities between textual criticism and historical linguistics are such that very minor adjustments to the definition of comparative method would produce a textbook definition of stemmatics:
                <blockquote><div class="ptext"><em class="term">Comparative method</em>: Comparisons of variants between two or more related languages are undertaken with the purpose of reconstructing their genealogy and proto-language.</div><div class="ptext"><em class="term">Stemmatics</em>: Comparisons of variants between two or more related

                from attested forms, I want to briefly look at two competing classes of stemmatic
                algorithms: maximum parsimony and clustering. Broadly speaking, clustering or
                distance methods compute the overall similarities between manuscript readings,
                without regard to whether the similarities are coincidental or inherited,<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1282">[30]</a> while maximum parsimony computes the "shortest" tree containing the least number of change events still capable of accommodating all the variants.  The difference is often expressed in evolutionary biology as that between a phenetic (clustering) versus a cladistic (parsimonious) approach.  Here is how Arthur Lee distinguishes the two:
                <blockquote><p>Cladistic analysis is sharply differentiated from cluster
                    analysis by that which it measures.  Cluster analysis groups the objects being
                    analysed or classified by how closely they resemble each other in the sum of
                    their variations, using statistical "distance measures." 
                    Cladistic analysis, on the other hand, analyses the objects in terms of the
                    evolutionary descent of their individual variants, choosing the evolutionary
                    tree which requires the smallest number of changes in the states of all the
                    variants.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1293">[31]</a></p></blockquote>
                In cladistic analyses, the evidentiary gold standard excludes most of the textual
                data from consideration: only shared derived readings as opposed to shared ancestral
                readings are believed to have probative value.  An ancestral reading, or retention,
                is any character string inherited without change from an ancestor.  A derived
                reading, by contrast, is a modification of a reading inherited from the ancestor,
                often motivated rather than arbitrary from a paleographic, metrical, phonological,
                manual, technological, aesthetic, grammatical, cognitive, or some other perspective
                (for example, the <cite class="title italic">Canterbury Tales</cite> scribe who, when
                confronted with the metrically deficient line "But tel me, why
                hidstow with sorwe" in the Wife of Bath's Prologue, alters
                "why" to "wherfor" to fill out the meter).  When such
                readings are contained in two or more manuscripts, they are regarded as potentially
                diagnostic.  Having made it through this initial round of scrutiny, they are then
                subject to a second round of inspections, which will result in exclusions of
                variants that have crept into the text via routes not deemed genealogically
                informative.  The transposition of the <span class="hi italic">h</span> and the <span class="hi italic">e</span> of <span class="hi italic">the</span> when keyed into a computer is
                a mundane example.  So pedestrian is this error that your word-processing program
                most likely automatically corrects it for you when you make it.  In the terminology
                of Don Cameron, it is an <em class="term">adventitous</em> rather than
                <em class="term">indicative</em> error.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1327">[32]</a> The stemmatic challenge is to screen out the adventitious variants, and successfully identify and use the indicative variants.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">Phenetic or clustering analyses involve the use of a distance metric to determine
                degrees of similarity among manuscripts.  The Levenshtein Distance algorithm, for
                example, named after the Russian scientist who created it, tabulates the number of
                primitive operations required to transform one variant into another. We can illustrate its application with one of the most notorious variants in the Shakespearean canon.  In Hamlet's first soliloquy, we encounter the following lines:
                <div class="lg"><div class="l">O that this too too sullied flesh would melt,</div><div class="l">Thaw and resolve itself into a dew . . .</div> (1.2.129-30)</div>
                The first folio reads "solid flesh," while the second
                quarto has "sallied flesh."  The Levenshtein or edit
                distance between them is determined as follows: let "solid" equal the
                source reading and "sallied" the target reading.  The first task is
                to align the words so as to maximize the number of matches between letters:<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1357">[33]</a><blockquote class="eg"><pre><tt>s o - l i - d

Identifying all the pairings helps us compute the minimum number of procedures needed to change one string into another. A mismatch between letters indicates that a substitution operation is called for, while a dash signals that a deletion or insertion is necessary. Three steps get us from source to target: a substitution operation transforms the "o" of "solid" into the "a" of "sallied"; an insertion operation supplies the "l" of "sallied"; and another insertion operation gives us the penultimate "e" in our target variant:
                <blockquote class="eg"><pre><tt>solid  — &gt; salid
salid  — &gt; sallid
sallid  — &gt; sallied</tt></pre></blockquote>
                    A distance of three edit operations (one substitution and two insertions) thus separates the two character strings.  In clustering, the greater the edit distance between different readings, the more dissimilar they are assumed to be.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">Although heterogeneous in their approach, both clustering and maximum parsimony are
                <span class="foreign i">ars combinatoria</span>.  That is, both involve making
                assumptions about and/or modelling various orders, numbers, combinations, and kinds
                of — as well as distances between — primitive operations that collectively account for
                all the known variants in a text's transmission history.  Both also take entropy for
                granted: they assume the depredations of time on texts to be relentless and
                non-reversible, with the result that the more temporally remote a descendant is from
                an ancestor, the more dissimilar to the ancestor it will be.  In terms of our tree graph, this means that a copy placed proximally to the root is judged more similar to the archetype than a copy placed distally to the root.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1393">[34]</a></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conjecture as Wordplay (Redux)</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">In biology, textual criticism, and historical linguistics, a transformation series
                (TS) is an unbroken evolutionary sequence of character states.  The changes that a
                word or molecular sequence undergoes are cumulative: state A gives rise to state B,
                which in turn generates C, and so on.  The assumption is that each intermediary node
                serves as a bridge between predecessor and successor nodes; state C is a modified
                version of B, while D is a derivation of C.  The changes build logically on one
                another and follow in orderly succession.  Consider, for example, a hypothetical

                And although deletions and insertions were never formally a part of doublet puzzles,
                they were central to another game exploring word generation, which Carroll dubbed
                "Mischmasch."<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1566">[41]</a>  Indeed, taken collectively, Carroll's games incorporate the full spectrum of grammatical operations on strings, almost as if they were intentionally designed to model patterns of descent with variation in cultural and organic systems.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">What should we make of the fact that scientific theories of transmission and reconstruction can be so effectively illustrated with a parlor game?  Recall that a correspondence between conjecture and wordplay was established earlier in this essay. There we discovered that a textual critic endeavoring to recover a prior text and a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs were often united in their reliance on letter substitutions, puns, anagrams, and other permutational devices. Noting that the procedures underlying such word games were amenable to algorithmic expression, we labeled both the textual critic and the prophet who perform them "computers." At the same time, we maintained that they were computers of a special sort, proficient in the semiotic processing of strings rather than the mathematical reckoning of numbers. Into their ranks we can also admit evolutionary biologists and historical linguists, for whom the grammatical operability of signs is no less germane.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">In a post-industrial, Westernized society, an individual with the proper education
                who displays an aptitude for string manipulation might find gainful employment as an
                evolutionary biologist or historical linguist or cryptographer.  In another milieu,
                that same individual might instead be inducted into the ways of the poet or prophet.
                The Mayan priest who practices calendrical divination through puns, the Mesopotamian
                baru who deciphers oracles through wordplay, and the Shakespearean soothsayer who
                interprets auguries by means of substitutive sounds and false etymologies find their
                21st-century scientific complement in the figure of the computational biologist.
                Searls remarks that Carroll's doublet puzzles reveal "a turn of
                  mind well suited to methodologies used in modern computational biology." [<a class="ref" href="#searls2001">Searls 2001</a>, 339] This statement has the effect of endowing what might otherwise be seen as an idle pastime with scientific rigor and purpose.  But we could also flip the words around to observe that the computational methods of the biologist reveal a turn of mind well suited to wordplay. By thus inverting the language, we begin to see the poet in the scientist as well as the scientist in the poet. The contention of this poet-scientist is that all living things evolve through combinatorial play. The Book of Life, it would seem, is a volume of poetry, a dictionary of wordplay, and a compendium of oracles all bound together.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Coda</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p64">In this essay I have tried to advance the proposition that conjectural knowledge in
                the humanities is a manifestation of the inalienable human need to imagine what might have been or could be or almost was.  This mandate of the subjunctive is beautifully conveyed by George Steiner in <cite class="title italic">After Babel</cite>: 
                <blockquote><p>It is the constructive powers of language to conceptualize the
                    world which have been crucial to man's survival in the face of ineluctable
                    biological constraints, this is to say in the face of death. It is the
                    miraculous — I do not retract the term — capacity of grammars to generate
                    counter-factuals, "if"-propositions and, above all, future
                    tenses, which have empowered our species to hope, to reach far beyond the
                    extinction of the individual. We endure, we endure creatively due to our
                    imperative ability to say "No" to reality, to build fictions of
                    alterity, of dreamt or willed or awaited "otherness" for our consciousness to
                    inhabit. [<a class="ref" href="#steiner1998">Steiner 1998</a>, xiii–xiv]</p></blockquote> 
                For Steiner, that "imperative ability" is more than a psychological or linguistic impulse; more, even, than a creative or ethical force; it is also a life instinct.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">In the course of this work I have also tried to show that algorithms on strings — vital to conjecture — are as computationally sound as algorithms on numbers.  We are so accustomed to thinking that punsters and textual critics somewhat imprecisely reshuffle symbols, whereas mathematicians and engineers methodically calculate them that it will perhaps take a class of scientists who process strings rather than numbers to convince us otherwise.  We have looked at just such a group of professionals, computational biologists, whose work on the chemical "letters" of DNA resembles nothing so much as the parlor game of doublets or word ladders.  And yet this form of wordplay is couched in the language of computation rather than poetry, vetted by biologists rather than poets or literary scholars, and published in scientific journals rather than poetry rags or literary monographs.  Perhaps most significantly, the similarities between the methods of the computational biologist and the textual scholar — like those between the soothsayer and textual scholar — are not coincidental, but causal and historical.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66">One of my primary objectives has been to dispute the commonplace assumption that the
                inner workings of conjecture are ineffable and opaque. R. J. Tarrant, for example,
                writes that "conjectural criticism advances slowly and
                unsteadily," proceeding at a "glacial pace"
                and is not amenable to "discussion of methods and
                    trends" [<a class="ref" href="#tarrant">Tarrant</a>, 121]. Remarks of this sort are scattered
                throughout the literature of textual scholarship: E. J. Kenney and Martin West
                profess similar sentiments, as does F. W. Hall, who remarks that, traditionally,
                conjecture "proceeds from no method and conveys no
                    certainty" [<a class="ref" href="#hall1913">Hall 1913</a>, 151]. My position, by contrast, has been that conjectural knowledge is produced in more determinate ways than is customarily acknowledged, which is to say through not only (or necessarily) the statistical processing of discrete symbols, but also their grammatical or semiotic processing.  Stated more generally, there are reciprocal relations among conjecture, computation, and semiotics. This essay, then, has been written with the conviction that a cogent theory of conjecture is a desideratum of textual studies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p67">67</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p67">But what about conjectural methods in humanistic fields other than textual studies
                and linguistics that don't rely on systems of inheritance and variation?  Take
                history, for instance, where the historical imaginary is our predominant tool for
                filling in the missing details of the past; or digital preservation, where the
                archivist must designate a primary user community for the cultural objects she
                preserves.  By projecting the knowledge base of this user group into the future, the
                archivist makes decisions about what kind of descriptive metadata and contextual
                information to include in order to "render the object
                intelligible" to posterity.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9609e1634">[42]</a>  If she misjudges the needs and attributes of this community — if her conjectural faculties falter — then the archive may be less meaningful, accessible, or useful than it would otherwise be.  Are these two forms of conjecture so very different, either from each other or from those already described, as to generally make comparisons between them baseless?  Or is it possible to create an integrated research narrative capable of accommodating a variety of conjectural projects, perhaps through recourse to a sophisticated typology of conjecture?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p68">68</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p68">My own hunch is that there are deep structures common to many types of conjecture and
                new methods available to others that await discovery and experimentation.  Our
                success in identifying and exploiting them, however, will depend in no small measure
                on how committed the digital humanities community is in coming years to building an
                information infrastructure that supports new models of scholarly communication and
                research. Patrick Juola, a computational linguist at Duquesne University, for
                example, is currently developing a prototype system for exploring corpus-based
                approaches to conjecture in the humanities.  As Juola explains, his idea is to
                program the computer "to make essentially random emendations to
                    texts and then rank them for plausibility using a set of agreed-upon
                    criteria," the underlying assumption being that the machine "is capable of devising and examining many more possible
                        readings than even the most prolific human author, and even if 99.9% of the
                        possible readings are flat gibberish, the one in a thousand may include
                        interesting and provocative readings that human authors have missed" (Patrick Juola, email to the aurthor, 3 Oct. 2008.)  Noting that this data-driven approach can be extended in a variety of ways, Juola emphasizes the versatility of the comparative framework he is proposing: 
                <blockquote><p>I could equally compare American and British literature, or 19th and 20th century literature, or first-person and third-person novels, or any other interesting category.  Essentially, what the prototype I envision will do is generate (and
                test superficially) random conjectures like <span class="hi quotes">[Works in Category 1] use [Semantic

                        to a structural principle of binary opposition between the |Threshold| and
                        |the middle| of the Door of the Palace, between |right| and |left|, between
                        |slit| and |lengthwise slit|.  It is thus the system itself, understood in
                        an ante litteram structural sense, which has prime importance.  The cases
                        which have been observed in the past are no longer the only ones registered,
                        but rather all possible, conceivable cases are laid out according to a
                        system based on oppositions and abstract rules. [<a class="ref" href="#manetti1993">Manetti 1993</a>, 11]</p></blockquote></div><div class="endnote" id="d9609e1079"><span class="noteRef">[21]</span>There is a question of nomenclature here.  I am aware that within tech
                    circles, Java, Pascal, and C++ would be denoted high-level programming languages
                    rather than machine languages.  The latter term is reserved for low-level code
                    legible only to the computer.  By contrast, a high-level programming language is
                    legible to humans and must be compiled into machine language before the computer
                    can process it.  Nonetheless, this narrow definition exists alongside a broader
                    one, which copposes "machine" or "artificial" language to "natural" or "human" language, in this way distinguishing Pascal or C++ or Java from Italian or English or Chinese.  It is this more generic sense of the term that I'm drawing on here.  The fact that so-called machine or artificial languages in the broader sense are almost always written in English adds a further layer of cultural, technological, and linguistic complexity to these various discriminations.</div><div class="endnote" id="d9609e1104"><span class="noteRef">[22]</span>On the emblems of the baru, see [<a class="ref" href="#manetti1993">Manetti 1993</a>, 5].</div><div class="endnote" id="d9609e1110"><span class="noteRef">[23]</span>See, for example, [<a class="ref" href="#bottero2001">Bottero 2001</a>], as well as the recent

                    biogenetics, textual criticism, and historical linguistics, I am also sensitive
                    to potential conflicts in their aims or intentions that deserve more attention
                    than I can afford to give them here.  One of my aspirations in publishing this
                    article is to raise awareness of and interest in conjecture in the digital
                    humanities. But I am less sanguine about the role it might play in biogenetics,
                    where the potential for abuse of the conjectural ethos is so great.  Take, for
                    example, the sub-discipline of synthetic biology, or "making
                        creatures from scratch," which is discussed in [<a class="ref" href="#woolfson2005">Woolfson 2005</a>].  On the reconstructive possibilities of this emerging discipline, Woolfson muses that "it might be possible to re-create the elusive ancestor of all human life on Earth, a hypothetical organism known as LUCA, or the 'least universal common ancestor'" since "the remnants of LUCA should be scattered across the genomes of all living things." He goes so far as to entertain the possibility of bringing LUCA "back to life." It is for this reason that the material difference between texts and bodies needs to be continually acknowledged. Otherwise we risk glib pronouncements that fail to take into account what is at stake in asserting only their likeness.  For discussion of the origins and limits of the analogy between genetic and textual (or informational) code, see [<a class="ref" href="#thacker2004">Thacker 2004</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#kay2000">Kay 2000</a>].</div><div class="endnote" id="d9609e1223"><span class="noteRef">[26]</span>Since first drafting this essay, I have been made aware that

                    The book includes an informative chapter on the crosscurrents between textual

                            comparisons of characters between two or more related taxa are
                            undertaken with the purpose of reconstructing their genealogy and
                            archetype.  Until recently, however, many scholars would have inserted a
                            full stop after "genealogy."  Less than two decades ago,
                            for example, H. Don Cameron insisted that "For the
                                zoologist the reconstructed ancestor is a fiction.  It is a convenient way of presenting the organized information about the relationships of the real animals in question.  Nobody tries to reconstruct a living, breathing theocodont or the protodipteron."  He contrasted these attitudes and beliefs with those in textual criticism, where the reconstructed text is "the real article, in a literal sense the text that Euripides wrote.  Reconstruction is a serious business, and the only point of studying manuscripts at all" [<a class="ref" href="#cameron">Cameron</a>]. On the contrary, reconstruction has been a desideratum of evolutionary biology from the start: one encounters a conjectural ethos in Darwin's Descent of Man and in the writings of, for example, Thomas Huxley, the eminent Victorian biologist and staunch defender of Darwin's model of evolution.  The ethos has always been there, the methodology has not; or rather, the methodology has been hobbled by the lack of a clear unit of comparison and conjecture.  But whereas conjectural criticism in recent decades has experienced a downtick in popularity in textual studies, the reverse is true in evolutionary and synthetic biology, where allographic methods have taken hold. With DNA and protein sequences — digital, discrete, and abstract — now firmly established as the clear units of conjectural analysis in evolutionary biology, the reconstructive paradigm has begun to flourish.</div><div class="endnote" id="d9609e1282"><span class="noteRef">[30]</span>In phylogenetics, this difference is expressed as that between so-called homoplastic characters and homologous characters.</div><div class="endnote" id="d9609e1293"><span class="noteRef">[31]</span>Qtd. in [<a class="ref" href="#salemans1996">Salemans 1996</a>, 44].
