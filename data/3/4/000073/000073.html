                  a "Blue-Ribbon Advisory Panel on Cyberinfrastructure,"
                  a panel chaired by Dan Atkins, then Dean of the School of Information at the
                  University of Michigan. The Atkins report was perceived by many as presaging some
                  major changes in the discussion (and funding) of computational infrastructure for
                  the sciences, and it prompted a number of follow-up reports and responses from
                  other quarters. One of these responses was commissioned by the American Council of
                  Learned Societies, and it focused on cyberinfrastructure for humanities and social
                  sciences.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Process</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">This essay reflects on what goes into producing such a report. In practical and

                  Cyberinfrastructure report, the object was to change the funding landscape, but in
                  our case there is no one funder who dominates that landscape as the NSF does in
                  computational science. Therefore, in some real sense, it was an important outcome
                  just to get representatives of the private foundations and the public funding
                  agencies to talk with one another about a shared agenda, and it was an equally
                  important outcome for the Commission to be able to represent the scholarly
                  community in setting that agenda.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The meeting with funders in June of 2006 to discuss the draft report was
                  particularly interesting. The meeting was co-hosted by the Andrew W. Mellon
                  Foundation and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and held at IMLS.
                  Present, in addition to Mellon and IMLS representatives, were representatives of
                  the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, the Library of
                  Congress, the National Science Foundation, the J. Paul Getty Trust, the Teagle
                  Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Archives
                  and Records Administration. There were a number of useful and substantive
                  suggestions made at that meeting, especially about the recommendations of the
                  report and how to focus them more effectively on particular audiences and
                  respondents. But for me, at least, the most striking thing about that meeting was
                  the realization that it was extremely useful and important for the funding
                  agencies to have a group and a process that could credibly claim to represent the
                  aspirations of the community which those agencies served, because it would allow
                  them to base their recommendations for programmatic goals on something other than
                  their own perceptions of what was needed. In short, it would help them to make the
                  case to their own boards, or (in the case of federal funders) to the legislature,
                  that certain goals and activities were important to support. I have been working
                  with both federal and private funders for fifteen years now, and in retrospect it
                  should have been perfectly obvious to me that this was an important reason for
                  doing the report, but it was not. Why? I think the reason is that when faculty
                  think about research funding, we find it difficult to step outside of our
                  immediate role as petitioners and think about the funding landscape from another
                  perspective--that of the funder. It is a commonly understood dynamic, in science
                  and engineering, that the community needs to come together and agree on research
                  priorities for a particular field, in order for funding agencies to prioritize the
                  programs they will offer and the goals they will pursue. Obviously, there are also
                  other forces at work in setting funding priorities, and the process of "agreeing
                     on research priorities" in a discipline is not necessarily a process that
                  ends in consensus, or in a framework into which everyone fits. But in the
                  humanities, the very notion of asking "What are the top research priorities?"
                  in history or in English seems absurd, since the value of a research project in
                  humanities disciplines is defined, to a large extent, by the originality with
                  which it defines the question it aims to address. Nonetheless, one clearly useful
                  outcome of the ACLS Commission's report was that it gave voice to some priorities
                  of a research community--even if those priorities did not take the form of
                  research problems to be solved, but of resources needed in digital form, or
                  training and support, or policy changes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Some of the direct effects of the ACLS Commission's report on funding agencies can
                  be seen in their own framing of new programs. For example, in presenting its
                  JISC/NEH Transatlantic Digitization Collaboration Grants program, the NEH notes
                  that <blockquote><p>Collaboration between U.S. and English institutions is a
                     key requirement for this grant category, based in part on the recommendations
                     for international collaboration in Professor Sir Gareth Roberts's "International Partnerships of Research Excellence U.K.-U.S.A
                        Academic Collaboration" (25-page PDF) and the report (51-page PDF) of
                     the American Council for [sic] Learned Societies' Commission on
                     Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences.</p></blockquote> Other
                  indications are in the meetings sponsored, for example the NEH Summit Meeting of
                  Digital Humanities Centers (April 12-13, 2007), organized with the Maryland
                  Institute for Technology in the Humanities and hosted at the NEH itself. The NEH's
                  description says that "The meeting is part of NEH's Digital
                     Humanities Initiative and was inspired by a recent report by the American
                     Council of Learned Societies’ Commission on Cyberinfrastructure"<a class="ref" href="http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/centers/" onclick="window.open('http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/cio/centers/'); return false">http://​www.neh.gov/​whoweare/​cio/centers/</a>.
                  The Digital Humanities Initiative as a whole can be seen as a programmatic
                  response to the ACLS report, and it was initiated about the same time that the
                  draft report appeared for public comment. Other indicators of impact in funding
                  agencies may be seen in the particular projects funded; for example, in the IMLS
                  National Leadership Grants for 2007, the Council on Library and Information
                  Resources was funded for "A National Program for Scholars'
                     Analysis and Development of Cyberinfrastructure," which aims to
                  coordinate "the new large-scale digital initiatives that are
                     being developed across the country in line with the recommendations of the
                     American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) Commission on Cyberinfrastructure
                     for the Humanities and Social Sciences"<a class="ref" href="http://www.imls.gov/news/2007/092507_list.shtm" onclick="window.open('http://www.imls.gov/news/2007/092507_list.shtm'); return false">http://​www.imls.gov/​news/​2007/​092507_list.shtm</a>.
                  Further signs might be seen in what program officers are writing and speaking
                  about, for example Joyce Ray (IMLS) speaking on "Building the
                     Cyberinfrastructure in the U.S." at the JISC Digitisation Conference in
                  Cardiff, Wales, July 19-20, 2007, or Chris Mackie (Mellon Foundation) writing on
                     "Cyberinfrastructure, Institutions, and
                     Sustainability" in <cite class="title">First Monday</cite> in June 2007 <a class="ref" href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_6/mackie/index.html" onclick="window.open('http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_6/mackie/index.html'); return false">http://​firstmonday.org/​issues/​issue12_6/​mackie/​index.html</a>,
                  and what community thought-leaders are speaking about, for example Greg Crane's
                  talk on "Repositories, Cyberinfrastructure And The
                     Humanities" at the NSF/JISC Repositories Workshop in April, 2007, in
                  Arizona <a class="ref" href="http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~repwkshop/papers/crane.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~repwkshop/papers/crane.html'); return false">http://​www.sis.pitt.edu/​~repwkshop/​papers/​crane.html</a>.
                  There's also been some international impact, as evidenced in "Our Cultural Commonwealth - notes de lectures," a largely favorable
                  French commentary on the report dated January 5, 2007 <a class="ref" href="http://artist.inist.fr/article.php3?id_article=376" onclick="window.open('http://artist.inist.fr/article.php3?id_article=376'); return false">http://​artist.inist.fr/​article.php3?id_article=376</a>,
                  and in Australia, where 2007's annual forum on Scholarly Communication, sponsored
                  by the Australian Academy of the Humanities, featured discussion of the ACLS
                  Commission's report <a class="ref" href="http://www.humanities.org.au/events/nscf/nscf2007/nscf2007.htm" onclick="window.open('http://www.humanities.org.au/events/nscf/nscf2007/nscf2007.htm'); return false">http://​www.humanities.org.au/​Events/​NSCF/​NSCF2007/​NSCF2007.htm</a>. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Not everyone was happy with the Commission's report, of course. And while there
                  were some <span class="hi italic">amicus curiae</span> briefs filed by scholars and
                  academic libraries, the stakeholders who felt most alienated by the report were
                  university presses and scholarly societies. This was in part because the draft of
                  the report submitted for public comment was directly critical of presses and
                  societies for failing to take risks, for taking a narrow view of their mission,
                  and for lacking imagination. After some sharp feedback on the draft, the
                  Commission did take a different tack in the final report, emphasizing positive
                  examples rather than negative ones, and credit rather than blame, but publishers
                  were not much mollified. A more or less typical response is this one, from Robert
                  Townsend of the American Historical Association: <blockquote><p>[T]he report
                     offers a rather fanciful lesson in the economics of scholarly publishing that
                     makes first-copy costs and sustainability disappear into a fog of "public
                        goods" and "collective action." The resulting picture should really
                     trouble non-profit publishers, as the commission rather blithely erases our
                     role in the system of scholarly communication along with the costs we have to
                     recover. As a result, we seem to be re-cast as an unnecessary impediment to the
                     development of a cyberinfrastructure. When the commission then calls on us to
                     engage with other parties (librarians and university administrators) about
                     these issues, it just seem to be inviting us into a dialogue about the
                     arrangements for our own funerals.</p></blockquote> A more recent response, by Sandy
                  Thatcher, director of Penn State's Press, repeats the complaint that the ACLS
                  Commission's report is uninformed and unrealistic with respect to the harsh
                  economic realities of university press and scholarly society publishing: <blockquote><p>[U]niversity presses would welcome the freedom to engage in the
                     supply of a "pure public good" like knowledge free of severe economic
                     constraints. Only the Commission doesn't tell us how to get to this promised
                     land. It doesn't even include in the final report the acknowledgment of the
                     draft report that...a variety of activities that presses could pursue..."could well produce sufficient value for libraries to be paid
                        for in the cash economy in which publishers now largely operate, if
                        publishers were properly capitalized to retool so they could provide such
                        services." But that is just the point. Where does such capital come
                     from?</p></blockquote> And later in the same piece: <blockquote><p>University
                     presses have been chronically underfunded, and even today few universities seem
                     to have much inclination to invest in their presses so that they could
                        "retool" themselves. On the contrary, to provide just one recent
                     example, the announcement of the position of director of the SUNY Press
                     includes this among its expectations: "increase financial
                        assets of the Press with the goal of achieving financial sustainability
                        within five years." In other words, the SUNY administration expects
                     the press soon to operate with no subsidy from the university at all. There is
                     no better way to hamstring a press from engaging in the kind of retooling and
                     experimentation that the Commission calls for in this report. So long as such
                     attitudes prevail among university administrators, the road to "open
                        access" will remain closed as far as university presses are
                     concerned.</p></blockquote> What continues to puzzle me, as chair of the ACLS
                  Commission, is that Presses don't see the report as anything that could be useful
                  to them in their conversations with university administrators about just these
                  issues, and also that these publishers--both university presses and scholarly
                  societies--seem always to start from the premise that the status quo is
                  non-negotiable, and then proceed to explain why they have no choice but to act as
                  they have been acting, since the economic conditions under which they operate are
                  non-negotiable. Certainly libraries and funding agencies did not respond to the
                  report in that way, nor have libraries often missed the opportunity to turn
                  criticisms to advantage, in their negotiation with university administrators.
                  Still, it is true that there are some exceptional presses who are doing
                  exceptional work that needs to be recognized--especially in those places where the
                  press has worked out a productive partnership with the library (and, sometimes,
                  the campus computing organization): Columbia's EPIC, The University of California
                  Press's Mark Twain project (and CDL collaborations), and the University of
                  Virginia Press's Rotunda imprint, which publishes a number of digital scholarly
                  projects that began as library projects, or the University of Illinois' History
                  Cooperative, which allows individual journals to experiment with pricing policies
                  in a shared infrastructure for e-journal publishing. But these are remarkable
                  precisely because they are exceptions, and the recent report from Ithaka ("University Publishing in a Digital Age") makes it clear
                  that university presses are losing mind-share with their campus-level
                  administrators, and losing the initiative to university libraries: <blockquote><p>In our interviews we detected significant detachment from
                     administrators about publishing's connection to their core mission; a high
                     level of energy and excitement from librarians about reinventing their roles on
                     campus to meet the evolving needs of their constituents; and a wide range of
                     responses from press directors, from those who are continuing to do what they
                     have always done, to those who are actively reconnecting with their host
                     institutions’ academic programs and engaging in collaborative efforts to
                     develop new electronic products.</p></blockquote> According to this report, press
                  directors <blockquote><p>acknowledge that they have not participated actively
                     enough in the academic life of their campus, nor have they effectively
                     demonstrated their worth to faculty and administrators. As a director said,
                        "We don’t do a good job of telling our universities why
                        we are important to them." One director spoke of a "feeling of
                        divorce" from the university leadership, expressing what seems to be a
                     common feeling among press leaders.</p></blockquote> That divorce is not going to come
                  with alimony, though, and if university presses don't figure out how to recast
                  their role as more central to the campus each lives on, they will not be
                  continuing their work somewhere else--they will be dismantled, possibly to be
                  replaced by scholarly publishing offices in libraries, or by commercial
                  publishers. Karla Hahn, who oversees the Association of Research Libraries' office
                  of scholarly communication, estimated in a recent public presentation at the
                  University of Illinois that over half of ARL libraries are now engaged in some
                  kind of publishing activity.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Conclusion</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">These are internecine disputes, though. The most important audience for the
                  humanities, and the audience least likely to be reached by a report from the
                  American Council of Learned Societies--or by university presses, or by university
                  libraries, for that matter--is the general public. And this was also the most
                  difficult audience for the humanities scholars who addressed the Commission, and
                  for the Commission itself. This is a point worth examining. The problem seemed to
                  be that humanities scholars found it very difficult to say exactly why the work
                  they do should matter to the general public; in fact, they often did not believe
                  that it would. I believe that this is directly related to the aforementioned
                  rhetoric of problem-solving: the sciences have a glorious and durable narrative of
                  progress toward the greater good through medical advances, technological
                  development, and scientific discoveries. Science, technology, and medicine are,
                  arguably, insufficiently self-conscious about whether or not their research
                  produces an unalloyed public good: in the history of the 20th century, for
                  example, they seem remarkably untroubled by Hiroshima, at least in their public
                  rhetoric; by contrast, the humanities seem to be keenly self-aware that expertise
                  in the practice and appreciation of literature, music, philosophy didn't save
                  Germany from Naziism, so they are reluctant to make simple-minded arguments about
                  intrinsic social good arising from the appreciation of high culture. And the more
                  complicated arguments that scholars might make for the value of their research or
                  the importance of their disciplines seem to them to be arguments that will matter
                  most to those who have already accepted the grounding assumption that the activity
                  itself is worthy, rather than being arguments that would persuade someone to share
                  that assumption. Interestingly, I think this self-abnegation is shared and even
                  reinforced by university presses, who seem, on the whole, unable to believe in the
                  Long Tail--unable, in other words, to believe that there are relatively large but
                  widely dispersed and non-professional audiences for almost any humanities topic.
                  In fact, I would argue that in this regard the humanities are much better off than
                  the sciences: the public might want the results of scientific research, but they
                  are not all that interested in the actual content and conduct of that research; in
                  the humanities, research does have a general audience, but publishers aren't
                  accustomed to looking for it. We need to look for it, though, and we need to
                  connect with the public, in the cyberinfrastructure they increasingly inhabit in
                  their daily lives. As I said in a 2006 presentation to the Association of American
                  University Presses on "Vernacular Computing," the
                  urgency to do this isn't just the presses'; it is also the universities': <blockquote><p>Fifteen years ago, the challenge before us was to imagine
                        how new technology might provide a new platform for the practice of
                        scholarship in the humanities, but today our challenge is the reverse. It is
                        no longer about opening the university and inviting the public in: it's
                        about getting out where they already live, and meeting the public in the
                        information commons, on the same terms that everyone else does. In fact,
                        it's almost too late for us. We will find that hard to believe, ensconced
                        (as we all are) in solid-seeming residential universities, with long
                        histories and the expectation of a long future — but older institutions on
                        more solid foundations have been swept away or radically transformed in
                        cultural upheavals of the past. In spite of the inertia of these
                        institutions, which we all know so well, the forces of change outside the
                        institution have much greater inertia, and all of the practical furniture of
                        our daily academic lives could easily be gone, or changed beyond
                        recognition, in a generation. (<a class="ref" href="http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~unsworth/AAUP.2006.html" onclick="window.open('http://www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~unsworth/AAUP.2006.html'); return false">http://​www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/​~unsworth/​AAUP.2006.html</a>)</p></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Recent Reports Relevant to Cyberinfrastructure in Humanities and Social
