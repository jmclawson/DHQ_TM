As budgets are slashed and marginal programs are eliminated in the current economic crisis, only the most articulate and productive will survive. Digital collections are proliferating, but most remain difficult to use, and digital scholarship remains a backwater in most humanities departments with respect to hiring, promotion, and teaching practices. Only the scholars themselves are in a position to move the field forward. Experiences of the sciences in their initiatives for cyberinfrastructure and eScience offer valuable lessons. Information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary research is now the norm in the sciences, while remaining experimental in the humanities. Discussed here are six factors for comparison, selected for their implications for the future of digital scholarship in the humanities: publication practices, data, research methods, collaboration, incentives, and learning. Drawing upon lessons gleaned from these comparisons, humanities scholars are "called to action" with five questions to address as a community: What are data? What are the infrastructure requirements? Where are the social studies of digital humanities? What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century? What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">This is a pivotal moment for the digital humanities.  The community has laid a foundation of research methods, theory, practice, and scholarly conferences and journals.  Can we seize this moment to make digital scholarship a leading force in humanities research? Or will the community fall behind, not-quite-there, among the many victims of the massive restructuring of higher education in the current economic crisis?  Much is at stake in the community’s ability to argue for the value of digital humanities scholarship and to assemble the necessary resources for the field to move from "emergent" to "established."</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The sciences, arts, and humanities have converged and diverged in various ways over the
          centuries. In the area of digital scholarship, many interests are in common across the
          disciplines.  It is the pace of adoption that is divergent. The sciences, and to a lesser
          extent the social sciences, have been successful in developing the technical, social, and
          political infrastructure for digital scholarship under the rubrics of
          <em class="term">cyberinfrastucture</em> — the term used in the U.S., and <em class="term">eScience</em> —
          the term more widely used in the U.K. and elsewhere [<a class="ref" href="#ukrc2009">U.K. Research Council e-Science Programme 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#atkins2003">Atkins et al. 2003</a>]. Digital scholarship remains emergent in the humanities, while eScience has become the norm in the sciences. The humanities need not emulate the sciences, but can learn useful lessons by studying the successes (and limitations) of cyberinfrastructure and eScience initiatives.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">While leaving definitions of "the humanities" to the reader, two complementary
          definitions of "digital humanities" provide a useful scope statement. Frischer’s
          definition is "the application of information technology as an
            aid to fulfill the humanities’ basic tasks of preserving, reconstructing, transmitting,
            and interpreting the human record" [<a class="ref" href="#frischer2009">Frischer 2009</a>, 15].
          One resulting from the UCLA Mellon seminar claims that "Digital
            humanities is not a unified field but an array of convergent practices that explore a
            universe in which print is no longer the exclusive or the normative medium in which
            knowledge is produced and/or disseminated" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#dhm2009">#dhm2009</a></span>. Taken together, the digital humanities is a new set of practices, using new sets of technologies, to address research problems of the discipline. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Problem Statement</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Interest in the digital humanities has grown steadily for several decades. The Digital
          Humanities Conferences have occurred annually since 1989, sponsored by the Alliance of
          Digital Humanities Organizations. Constituent organizations of the Alliance have held
          conferences since 1973 [<a class="ref" href="#adho2009">Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations 2009</a>]. MITH <a href="#mith2009">(Maryland
            Institute for Technology in the Humanities 2009)</a>
          celebrated its tenth anniversary, and IATH <span class="error"><a href="#iath2009">(Institute for Advanced
            Technology in the Humanities 2009)</a></span> at the University of Virginia its 17th anniversary. Academic research in
          the digital humanities at UCLA, Duke, Stanford, King’s College London, and elsewhere also
          appears to be thriving. Funding continues apace, with the Mellon Foundation, Council on
          Library and Information Resources, National Endowment for the Humanities, U.K. Arts and
          Humanities Research Council, and others focusing on infrastructure, tools, and services to
          support humanities scholarship in digital environments.  Yet digital scholarship remains a
          backwater in much of the humanities. Concerns about publishing, tenure, and promotion for
          digital humanities scholars are a continuing theme in the conferences and in the
          literature of the field [<a class="ref" href="#friedlander2008">Friedlander 2008</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#friedlander2009">Friedlander 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2006">Unsworth et al. 2006</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Despite many investments and years of development, basic infrastructure for the digital humanities is still lacking. Those who wish to gather and analyze digital data for humanities problems often find the overhead daunting, as exemplified by this emailed complaint from a history student in my scholarly communication course, who is pursuing a doctoral dissertation about the German enlightenment:
          
          <blockquote><p>I’m finding that something as simple as constructing my maps of
            related concepts are not easily applied to primary sources in digital libraries.
            <em class="emph">So what use are the digital libraries, if all they do is put digitally unusable information on the web?</em> The digital libraries don’t offer a platform for traditional note taking, much less for larger scale analysis, either quantitative or qualitative. (emphasis added; quoted with permission)</p></blockquote>"Digital libraries," the term used by my student, usually
          implies the existence of tools, services, and a library imprimatur of cataloging and
          curation. Her complaint is more about digital collections, which often lack basic
          capabilities for retrieval or analysis. This distinction is particularly relevant to the
          digital humanities.  Content in digital collections may be "relatively
          raw," as [<a class="ref" href="#lynch2002">Lynch 2002</a>] puts it; others can add layers of
          interpretation, presentation, tools, and services, but these layers may be maintained
          separately from the content [<a class="ref" href="#borgman1999">Borgman 1999</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2000">Borgman 2000</a>];
          [<a class="ref" href="#lynch2002">Lynch 2002</a>]. The invisibility of essential infrastructure for digital scholarship in the humanities is but one of many challenges to be addressed in growing the field. Until analytical tools and services are more sophisticated, robust, transparent, and easy to use for the motivated humanities researcher, it will be difficult to attract a broad base of interest within the humanities community.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Whose problem is it to improve the situation — that is, to design, develop, and deploy the
          scholarly infrastructure for digital humanities?  As my UCLA colleague, Johanna Drucker,
          put it so well, "Leaving it to 'them' is unfair, wrongheaded,
          and irresponsible. Them is us" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">#drucker2009</a></span>.  She believes
          that the digital humanities are at a "critical juncture," and is concerned that her fellow scholars are deferring responsibility for action to librarians, computer scientists, technology developers, publishers, and others.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The operant terms in "digital humanities scholarship" are the latter two.  Scholarly
          methods are as deeply seated in the humanities as they are in the sciences [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>].  Only those who do the work and who require the infrastructure are in a position to take the field forward.  Librarians and technology developers are essential partners, but those who conduct the research must take the lead.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">This article, based on a keynote presentation to the most recent Digital Humanities

First, I frame the notion of scholarly information infrastructure, then compare the approaches to digital scholarship of the sciences and the humanities.  My analysis concludes with a call to action for the humanities community.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Scholarly Information Infrastructure</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">The term <em class="term">scholarly information infrastructure</em> encompasses the technology, services,
          practices, and policy that support research in all disciplines.  Cyberinfrastructure and
          eScience — both coined initially in reference to the sciences and technology, and both now
          used more broadly — refer to an infrastructure that enables forms of scholarship that are
          information- and data-intensive, distributed, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary.
          eResearch has become the collective term for variants such as eScience, eSocial Science,
          and eHumanities [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>]. The report of the <cite class="title italic">Commission on Cyberinfrastructure
          for the Humanities and Social Sciences</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2006">Unsworth et al. 2006</a>] was modeled on the

          emphasize the humanities’ motivations to make cultural heritage more widely available for
          teaching, research, and outreach.  A similar argument is made by <span class="error"><a href="#presner2009">Todd Presner and Chris

          infrastructure that originate in the humanities.  Amy Friedlander provides a
          notable exception [<a class="ref" href="#friedlander2009">Friedlander 2009</a>]. She identified four research areas in digital scholarship where the interests of humanists, technology researchers, and others converge. These are scale, language and communication, space and time, and social networking. Issues of scale are of general interest because methods and problems must be approached much differently when one has, for example, the full text of a million books rather than a handful. Inspection is no longer feasible; only computational methods can examine corpora on that scale.  Issues of language and communication, which are central to the humanities, are of broader interest for problems such as pattern detection and cross-language indexing and retrieval.  Space and time encompass the new research methods possible with geographic information systems, geo-tagged documents and images, and the increased ability to make temporal comparisons. Social network analysis, long popular in sociology and bibliometrics, has become generalized to include patterns of social relationships in older texts or in online communication. Cross-cutting agendas such as these can be very influential in the design of an encompassing infrastructure.  Humanities researchers need to be at the table as fundamental infrastructure decisions are being made.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Science [and/or/versus] the Humanities</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The humanities and the sciences each encompass broad swaths of scholarship, with much

            the printed edition) to be the edition of record. Under pressure from authors, the
            majority of scholarly journals now appear to allow online posting of some form of

            of digital humanities. The distinction between print and digital publication is as much
            about epistemology as genre. Digital publishing is not simply repackaging a book or
            article as a computer file, although even a searchable pdf has advantages over paper. By
            incorporating dynamic multi-media or hypermedia, digital publishing offers different

One is the shorter time from submission to publication.

The humanities could benefit from faster turnaround, reaching audiences much sooner.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">A second advantage of digital publishing — even more critical — is the larger audience

            those with access to a physical copy can read print-only publications. The number of
            titles and the number of copies of scholarly books and journals published in print form

            concern to the humanities.  One is that print material — including older material —
            becomes "widowed" as students and scholars alike search only online. The widowing
            problem was recognized early in the days of online catalogs, and was a major impetus for
            research libraries to digitize their entire back catalogs rather than only records of
            new material [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2000">Borgman 2000</a>]; <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#lynch2003">#lynch2003</a></span>; [<a class="ref" href="#lynch1995">Lynch &amp; Garcia-Molina 1995</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">The other consequence is that easier access to online material frequently increases its
            rate of citation. Articles published in open access journals, open repositories, or
            dual-published by providing preprints or postprints online, tend to have a citation
            advantage over articles published only in closed-access journals, whether print or

            with higher citation is difficult to dispute. As do authors in other fields, scholars in
            the humanities desire recognition in the form of citations to their work. Universities
            consider citation metrics in hiring and promotion decisions, despite known problems in
            their use for evaluating scholarly productivity [<a class="ref" href="#bollen2008">Bollen &amp; Van de Sompel 2008</a>]; <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#kurtz2010">#kurtz2010</a></span>; [<a class="ref" href="#monastersky2005">Monastersky 2005</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#reedijk2008">Reedijk &amp; Moed 2008</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">In sum, the sciences have benefited from online publication in ways that the humanities have not (yet).

As the proportion of print-only publication continues to decrease, those for whom it is their only venue risk reaching an ever smaller and more closed community with their scholarship.  Curation of digital objects is a concern in all fields, and is a topic that has the attention of management in libraries and archives.

Generally speaking, humanities scholars have far less control over the intellectual property rights of their sources — these raw materials — than do scientists, whose data usually are original observations or specimens.

Campus libraries have been consolidated in efforts to minimize the number of public service points to be staffed.  Books, journals, and other physical materials have been moved to remote facilities, paged from the stacks upon request.  Professional librarians, while a smaller proportion of library staffs, are turning their attention away from collection building — given the budget crises — and toward making the best use of the materials they have.

Notions of "open science" date
            back at least to Francis Bacon, with scientific findings being accepted only after peer
            review. Scholars’ incentives to share their results include recognition and acceptance
            of their work, which in turn drives hiring and promotion. In the sciences, authors may
            be required to release data as a condition of publishing the papers on which they are
            based.  Funding agencies also are becoming more assertive about the release of data that
            result from grants. However, publishing data is a far less mature practice than is
            publishing books and articles. Releasing a major dataset rarely brings as much
            recognition as releasing a major paper or book, but that balance is shifting, at least

            varying degrees [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>]:  (1) Faculty get more rewards for publishing papers and books than for releasing data; (2) the effort of individuals to document their data for use by others is much greater than the effort required to document them only for use by themselves and their research team; (3) data and sources offer a competitive advantage and are essential to establishing the priority of claims; and (4) data are often viewed as one’s own intellectual property to be controlled, whether or not the data (or their sources) are legally owned.  Means exist to address each of these concerns, but all are complex responses to a complex environment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55">The first disincentive is the most universal across disciplines.  The sciences and
            medicine are under the greatest pressure to release their data. In these disciplines the
            reward structure is adapting, and repositories and data structures exist.  While humanities scholars are under less pressure to release their data and sources, they are contributing models, modules, and tools to participatory projects and shared collections.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p56">Data documentation is an issue in all fields, but as the volume of data increases, consistent documentation becomes progressively more necessary.  Once data are captured cleanly, sharing them later becomes less of a problem.  Humanities scholars are acutely aware of the importance of metadata and finding aids in discovering sources. Metadata are equally important for data curation. Scholars understand the roles that documentation must play, while librarians and archivists have the expertise in documentation standards, practices, and technologies.  Data documentation is thus an obvious area of partnership for humanities scholars and information professionals, together addressing the requirements for sustainability of research products.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p57">57</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p57">The third disincentive — competitive advantage — is often addressed in the sciences
            through embargoes, whereby the investigators have a set period of time (from a few
            months to a few years, depending on the field) after the end of a grant before being
            required to share their data.  Embargoes serve two complementary purposes: they protect
            the scholars’ control over data, and they ensure that others will have access to the
            data within a reasonable time period. In the humanities, scholars are similarly
            concerned about controlling access to the sources of their data, whether the Dead Sea
            Scrolls or a set of manuscripts in a university archive, until they have published their
            research. As data sources such as manuscripts and out-of-print books are digitized and
            made publicly available, individual scholars will be less able to hoard their sources.
            This effect of digitization on humanities scholarship has been little explored, but
            could be profound. Open access to sources promotes participation and collaboration,
            while the privacy rules of libraries and archives ensure that the identity of
            individuals using specific sources is not revealed. Libraries and archives endeavor to
            maintain privacy in the use of digital as well as print sources. However, when digital
            content is controlled by commercial entities, protecting the privacy of users is a
            greater concern [<a class="ref" href="#mass2006">Mass Digitization 2006</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#hoofnagle2009">Hoofnagle 2009</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">Intellectual property, the fourth disincentive to share data and sources, is the most
            intractable. The need to establish data sharing agreements in collaborative projects

            can be clarified through negotiation. If the research depends upon material acquired
            from others, such as cell lines, rules on data release will be governed by contract. The
            reliance of humanities scholarship on cultural records, as discussed above, creates
            particularly complex intellectual property challenges in the sharing of data. For
            example, an art historian usually can publish his or her notes, but not the paintings on
            which the research is based.  In the case of cultural models such as digital cities, it
            can be difficult to distinguish between data that represent an individual city and the
            model in which those data are incorporated. Difficulties in separating data from models
            (a problem in the sciences and in the humanities) plague both curation and data release
            efforts [<a class="ref" href="#hypercities2009">HyperCities 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#rome2009">Rome Reborn 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#save2009">Serving and Archiving Virtual Environments 2009</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p59">59</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p59">In sum, the digital humanities encounter most of the same incentives and disincentives for sharing data and sources faced by the sciences and by other disciplines.

The scope of cyberlearning concerns in the Task Force report was necessarily constrained to the U.S. and to the domains funded by the NSF, which do not include the arts and humanities.

            lack of interoperability. Unless products are easily adapted to new uses, others have
            little incentive to invest in them. Both cyberinfrastructure and cyberlearning
            initiatives are constructing common technical platforms that will improve the
            sustainability and reuse of tools, services, and content.  Some of these technical
            platforms can be leveraged for digital humanities scholarship.  Where capabilities are
            lacking, the community can work in concert to construct them.  Common platforms and

            scientists" early on.  Hands-on science approaches endeavor to engage students
            in "real" science, making it more interesting and exciting than purely textbook
            approaches [<a class="ref" href="#pea2003">Pea. et al 2003</a>]. Projects like the Sloan Digital

            humanities.  If students can explore cultural records from the early grades and learn to
            construct their own narratives, they may find the study of humanities more lively.  By
            the time they are college students, they will have learned methods of collaborative work

Librarians, archivists, programmers, and computer scientists will be essential collaborators, each bringing complementary skills.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p68">68</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p68">A number of developments in cyberinfrastructure, eScience, and eResearch offer guidance to the digital humanities community in the quest to become a more established field with a broader base of infrastructure.  One is in the area of publication practices.  The humanities lag in digital publication of journals and books.  Digital publishing, while far from a panacea, offers a number of advantages in the speed, scope, and format of communication. Scholarly print publishing is on the decline, and those who publish only in print form risk being isolated, talking only to each other.  More digital-only venues are needed, where dynamic and visual work can be published in its vernacular form.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p69">69</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p69">Another area is the dissemination and use of data.  The humanities community should continue to clarify their choices of data and data sources, for these will drive what content is produced, captured, managed, and available for reuse.  Questions of data are closely related to research methods, which also are evolving.  Data-driven research methods are most valuable when they enable scholars to ask new questions in new ways.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p70">70</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p70">Collaboration is essential in digital humanities projects.  Few individuals have the range of expertise required to execute these projects alone.  Humanists should continue to seek out complementary partners and encourage people to listen and learn from each other.  Working together is also more likely to lead to common platforms and other means of reducing the overhead of technical projects.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p71">71</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p71">In both the sciences and the humanities, incentives to share one’s writing are more obvious than are incentives to share one’s data and sources.  In the sciences, data release is being encouraged (or required) by journals and funding agencies, and data-driven research methods can draw upon large corpora that grow as new observations are contributed. In the humanities, data release is less of an issue, but the availability of common technical platforms, tools, and services will promote the sharing of data and sources. The disincentives to share are complex in both the sciences and the humanities, but are being addressed.  As the sciences learn how to share data and to share credit for their findings, the humanities can build upon their best practices. Intellectual property constraints remain a major stumbling block, and the considerations vary between the sciences and the humanities.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p72">72</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p72">Opportunities for using cyberinfrastructure for learning exist in all disciplines.  Distributed access to scholarly content, common technical platforms, and open resources will advance the humanities as well as the sciences.</div></div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">A Call to Action</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p73">73</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p73">In the process of developing the keynote presentation for the 2009 Digital Humanities Conference and in writing this paper, I consulted many individuals in the digital humanities community for their thoughts on the issues facing the field.  From these discussions and my analyses above, five pressing problems emerged.</div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">What are data?</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p74">74</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p74">What constitute data in the humanities? What are data sources? How are they made, shared, valued, used, and reused? Answering these questions will enable the digital humanities community to be more articulate about its scope and its goals, and better positioned to identify their requirements for infrastructure.</div></div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">What are the infrastructure requirements?</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p75">75</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p75">The sciences have struggled with this question for a decade or two already. They have
              convened workshops and study panels, and launched funding initiatives addressed
              specifically at defining, designing, and deploying the necessary infrastructure for
              eScience.  The humanities have tackled this question on a much smaller scale, leaving
              them in the position of building upon the infrastructure constructed by and for other
              disciplines.  As Johanna Drucker put it so well, "them is
                us" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">#drucker2009</a></span>.  It is time for the community to articulate its own requirements and to act upon them.</div></div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">Where are the social studies of digital humanities?</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p76">76</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p76">Why is no one following digital humanities scholars around to understand their practices, in the way that scientists have been studied for the last several decades? This body of research has informed the design of scholarly infrastructure for the sciences, and is a central component of cyberinfrastructure and eScience initiatives. Given how rapidly scholarship in the humanities is evolving, it is fertile ground for behavioral research.  The humanities community should invite more social scientists as research partners and should make themselves available as objects of study.  In doing so, the community can learn more about itself and apply the lessons to the design of tools, services, policies, and infrastructure.</div></div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">What is the humanities laboratory of the 21st century?</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p77">77</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p77">This is a question of great concern to research libraries as well as to humanities scholars.  The library continues to be a laboratory for the humanities, but not the only laboratory.  Humanities scholars run computing laboratories and may work in distributed virtual environments for research and for learning. Humanists need to partner both with librarians and with the information technology planning and policy groups on their campuses.  These communities urgently need to "think together" about the common challenges faced in a time of shrinking budgets for collections, physical space, staffing, and technology services.</div></div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">What is the value proposition for digital humanities in an era of declining budgets?</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p78">78</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p78">For universities, the current economic recession is like no other.  Public and private universities alike are re-examining core principles as budgets are slashed by 10% to 30% from one year to the next.  Nothing is sacred, and "because it’s beautiful" is not a viable economic argument.  The sciences have been remarkably effective at making the argument for their value in economic and political terms, whether to university administrations, legislatures, funding agencies, or the general public.  While the humanities will have difficulty making parallel arguments in terms of economic competitiveness and medical advances, they have plenty to offer in terms of cultural understanding, writing and design skills, and critical thinking.  Digital scholarship also promotes technical skills, which can be highlighted.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p79">79</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p79">Digital projects require resources in the form of computers, software, staff, and content.  Non-digital scholarship also costs money, of course, but more often in the form of travel and subsistence expenses for research in remote archives.  Tradeoffs in travel and digitization can be made more explicit.  The number of people who will use and benefit from any given project also can be made clearer. Investments in common technical platforms and standards that leverage resources across larger numbers of people and projects are easier to justify.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p80">80</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p80">The digital humanities community has produced some beautiful work and made many
              advances in technology, design, and standards.  Now is the moment to consolidate that
              knowledge and to articulate the community’s requirements and goals.  Go forth and do
              great things...</div></div></div><div id="acknowledgements" class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Acknowledgements</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p81">81</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p81">I am grateful to the colleagues who provided thoughtful commentary on an earlier draft
