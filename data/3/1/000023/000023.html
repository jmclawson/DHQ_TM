      world than students of the Greco-Roman world but the first generation
      of digital classics has seen relatively superficial methods to address
      the problems of print culture. We are now beginning to see new
      intellectual practices for which new terms, eWissenschaft and

Evidence for this is the fact that while they were under tyrannical rulers, the Athenians were no better in war than any of their neighbors, yet once they got rid of their tyrants, they were by far the best of all. This, then, shows that while they were oppressed, they were, as men working for a master, cowardly, but when they were freed, each one was eager to achieve for himself. (Herodotus 5.78, tr. after Godley)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="ptext">I am no sculptor, to make statues fixed motionless on the same pedestal. Go, sweet song, on every merchant-ship and rowboat that leaves Aegina, and announce that Lampon's powerful son Pytheas [5] won the victory garland for the pancratium at the Nemean games. (Pindar Nemean 5.1-5, tr. after Diane Svarlien)</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The first passage above follows a military encounter in which the Athenians show, for the first time, that terrible energy which would (at least according to our Athenian sources) fascinate and unnerve the rest of fifth-century Greece.  Students of classical Athens have for millennia contemplated the energy that liberation released — Herodotus’ wonder has echoed ever since and served as one motivation for human fascination with Athens and its achievements.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e129">[1]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The early years of the twenty-first century have seen a heroic age for intellectual life. Ideas have poured across the world and new minds have joined the professionalized academics and authors in grappling with the heritage of humanity. Often rough and unpolished, unconcerned with the niceties of convention, a new generation of digital entities has exploded across human society, creating wikis, blogs and millions of electronic resources. Plato’s Socrates scorned writing itself on the grounds that the written word was as powerless to answer our questions as a mute painting (Plat. <cite class="title italic">Phaedrus</cite> 275d). Now each question becomes a challenge as active readers probe relentlessly the sprawling information space beneath their fingers. Wikipedia has demonstrated a new form of intellectual production that challenges the assumptions that many of us internalized in graduate school about how knowledge can be described and ideas shared.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e136">[2]</a>  The scale of projects such as Wikipedia deserves serious reflection: the English Wikipedia has, as of summer 2008, more than 2.4 million entries.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e143">[3]</a>  By one estimate, Wikipedia has absorbed 100 million hours of labor — put another way, Wikipedia has, if measured by the labor invested, become a billion dollar project <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#shirky2008">#shirky2008</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Changes go beyond traditional academic channels.  The 9/11 attacks in 2001 were the last major event owned by the centralized 20th century media.  With the Tsunami and the 7/7 London bombings, we had shifted "from the broadcasters owning the story, to the people involved in the events owning their own stories and spreading it to those who they know and care about, using their own communication channels."<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e155">[4]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Conventional streams of refereed publications (such as this collection) are necessary but insufficient — this introduction has already cited Wikipedia, a blog and the video for a presentation at a conference. We cannot make the decisions that we need to live in the world around us without constantly evaluating information that has no conventional academic pedigree.  Every anxious editorial fretting about undomesticated ideas prowling through an internet jungle underscores the urgent need for that critical thinking that we in the liberal arts claim to instill.  The internet may prove to be the best thing for humanities education since the rulers of early modern Europe found that classical training provided them with the administrators with whom to build strong nation states.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">No field of study is poised to benefit more than those of us who study the ancient Greco-Roman world and especially the texts in Greek and Latin to which philologists for more than two thousand years have dedicated their lives. Our predecessors worked in Alexandria, Damascus and Baghdad as well as Berlin, Oxford and Venice.  Many lived in states whose names we may never have heard.  Most spoke languages like Syriac or the dialects of medieval Europe, which have themselves passed into history. They preserved the battered remains of the past in isolated monasteries and the libraries of aristocrats. They raised capital and set type, then sent Greek and Latin texts coursing through Europe and then the world. They convinced the powerful that the study of Greek and Latin would provide the supple and disciplined minds needed to fashion, maintain and expand the nation states of Europe and their empires across the world. And in the twentieth-century, as other disciplines emerged as filters to identify the promising and send them on their way to worldly privilege, classicists carried their field forward, opened up their curricula to those who had not learned Greek and Latin and, from the margins of the intellectual world, continued their researches on the texts that they loved</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The papers in this collection reflect a new generation of classicists — entrepreneurial in their disruptive actions, impatient of convention, hunting for new methods to understand and to disseminate those ancient texts to which they, like dozens of generations before them, have dedicated their lives. It is hard to predict what the future holds for the intellectual practices and products of twentieth century print-based classical studies.  In the opening of his fifth Nemean Ode Pindar reveled in the speed and reach of the written word: his songs could be copied and race across the known world in the largest ship and the smallest boat, while the grandest statues remain fixed and mute upon their pedestals.  The texts of antiquity, freed from the tyrannical limitations of expensive print publication, preserved in multiple servers across the globe, flash instantaneously anywhere that the internet can reach — hundreds of millions of desktops and mobile devices. Homer, Plato, Virgil, Cicero — they all reach more of humanity than ever was conceivable in the millennia since they set down their styli for the last time and passed into dust.  And it is not just physical access — we already can, with simple links between source text and its commentaries, translations, morphological analyses and dictionary entries, provide a better reading environment than was ever conceivable in print culture.  We know from the readers of our web sites that texts in Greek and Latin, of many types, now fire the minds to which twenty years ago they had no access.  And if this reading environment now supports those proficient in English, we can already design libraries that will, within a reasonable period of time, support readers in the less commonly spoken languages of the European Union such as Croatian and Hungarian and widely spoken languages such as Arabic and Chinese.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Terms and continuities</h1><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Wissenschaft and Philology</h2><blockquote><p class="ptext">As to the speeches which were made either before or during the war, it was hard for me, and for others who reported them to me, to recollect the exact words.  I have therefore put into the mouth of each speaker the sentiments proper to the occasion, expressed as I thought he would be likely to express them, while at the same time I endeavoured, as nearly as I could, to give the general purport of what was actually said.  [2] Of the events of the war I have not ventured to speak from any chance information, nor according to any notion of my own; I have described nothing but what I either saw myself, or learned from others of whom I made the most careful and particular enquiry.  [3] The task was a laborious one, because eye-witnesses of the same occurrences gave different accounts of them, as they remembered or were interested in the actions of one side or the other.  [4] And very likely the strictly historical character of my narrative may be disappointing to the ear.  But if he who desires to have before his eyes a true picture of the events which have happened, and of the like events which may be expected to happen hereafter in the order of human things, shall pronounce what I have written to be useful, then I shall be satisfied.  My history is an everlasting possession, not a prize composition which is heard and forgotten. (Thuc. 1.22, tr. Jowett)</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The distinction between science and the humanities reflects particular traditions of the English speaking world. In German, for example, <em class="emph">Wissenschaft</em> includes all systematic intellectual work — we need to specify <em class="emph">Naturwissenschaft</em> or <em class="emph">Geisteswissenschaft</em> if we want to distinguish between the natural sciences and the humanities.  The term <em class="emph">Altertumswissenschaft</em> describes the systematic analysis of the past, including both the textual and the material record. 
       </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">We thus use the term Wissenschaft to describe the output of the systematic study of antiquity as it appears in material forms such as articles and monographs, plans and maps, images and diagrams, editions and reference works.  Whether or not we believe that we can reconstruct aspects of the ancient world as they actually were, we develop our ideas on the basis of primary and secondary sources stored in material form.
        </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">For the purposes of this introduction, philology describes the production of shared primary and secondary sources about linguistic sources, while classical philology focuses upon classical Greek and Latin, as these languages have been produced from antiquity through the present. The famous passage from Thucydides, quoted above, is relevant for several reasons. First, Thucydides was one of the first to apply systematic methods to represent in textual form, as accurately as he could, the events of the past — his history of the Peloponnesian War has been a model for Wissenschaft.  Second, Thucydides used writing as a medium to disseminate his ideas, but he drew upon every source available, including eyewitness interviews, archaeological remains, and the textual record.  Third, Thucydides’ words seek to represent an entire world — we cannot fully study Thucydides without engaging as well with the material record.  Nor is this material record simply a source with which to illustrate the topics that Thucydides has included.  We need to develop the fullest possible understanding of the material record in order to develop our own understanding of how Thucydides represents his subject. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The terms eWissenschaft and ePhilology, like their counterparts eScience and eResearch, point towards those elements that distinguish the practices of intellectual life in this emergent digital environment from print-based practices.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e199">[5]</a>  Terms such as eWissenschaft and ePhilology do not define those differences but assert that those differences are qualitative.

He it was who [274d] invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and, most important of all, letters.  Now the king of all Egypt at that time was the god Thamus, who lived in the great city of the upper region, which the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and they call the god himself Ammon.  To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians.  But Thamus asked what use there was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved [274e] or disapproved.  The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, "This invention, O king," said Theuth, "will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered."  But Thamus replied, "Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another;  [275a] and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess.  For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.  Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them.  You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem [275b] to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise."</td></tr></table></div></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Those of us who grew up hearing that we should read more and that television had damaged our minds may smile when we hear Plato’s Socrates two and a half millennia ago criticizing the written word for damaging our minds.

We can work our way through a Greek text, looking up every word in a dictionary and using modern translations to orient ourselves, but we will not understand the text in the same way as we would if we could understand the language fluently.

Infrastructure includes intellectual categories (e.g., literary genres, linguistic phenomena, and even the canonical book/chapter/verse/line citation schemes whereby we cite chunks of text), material artifacts such as books, maps, and photographs, buildings such as libraries and book stores, organizations such as universities and journals, business models such as subscriptions, memberships, and fee simple purchases, and social practices such as publication and peer review.  Our infrastructure constrains the questions that we ask and our sense of the possible. Thus, the Homeric narrator rules out the idea of representing the names of every hero who participated in the Trojan War. The twenty-first century fan of American baseball can, by contrast, locate not only the name but the basic statistics recorded for every person who ever threw a pitch or swung the bat in a major league game. By the classical period, we begin to find lists of citizens, office-holders, temple dedications, tribute paid and similar categories.

Instead they turned towards articles and expository monographs on topics often derived from their colleagues in the Modern Language Association.

We live in a digital age in which we need to rethink our most fundamental resources -- we are reinventing the forms and functions of our editions, lexica, encyclopedias, commentaries, grammars, bibliographies and every other textual category that evolved in a print ecosystem.  And as we feel our way forward, we need to rebuild our entire infrastructure.  In a primarily print world, we can turn to digital tools for documents that contribute at the margins — e.g., digital scholia for a major classical author.  In the digital world, we want the scholia but we also need editions of our canonical authors.

They focus on producing, as quickly as possible, the same intellectual objects to which their communities are already accustomed.  In this stage of work, catalogues may grow far more elaborate — the TLG and JSTOR allow us to search all the words in primary and secondary sources, while Google dynamically generates maps of places and lists of frequently quoted passages automatically extracted from its image books. All of these projects provide, in effect, a new generation of catalogues where the books remain unchanged.

Progress has been steady and solid:  in April 2000 1,500 entries had been translated,  by July 2008 that number had increased by 23,000, with 24,500 entries translated and vetted (see <a class="ref" href="http://www.stoa.org/sol/about.shtml" onclick="window.open('http://www.stoa.org/sol/about.shtml'); return false">http://www.stoa.org/sol/about.shtml</a>.</div></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">The <a class="ref" href="http://www.stoa.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.stoa.org/'); return false">Stoa Publishing Consortium</a>, founded in

When these three sources of energy begin to interact with one another, the resulting environment is qualitatively different not only from print culture but from any of the three digital environments taken in isolation.  Having reviewed some developments in the previous generation, we can now begin to consider the implications for ePhilology (primary and secondary sources relevant to classical Greek and Latin), eClassics (ancient Greek and Latin as they work within human minds), and Cyberinfrastructure (the material systems whereby we exchange the objects of our intellectual labor and ourselves internalize these objects).  The following sections describe ePhilology and eClassics. The conclusion to this collection returns to the Cyberinfrastructure towards which the individual articles point.</div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Producing new knowledge: ePhilology</h2><blockquote><p class="ptext">Any one can discourse to you forever about the advantages of a brave defence, which you know already.

For anyone whose career extends more than a decade, current technologies are astonishingly powerful. In 1982, it cost the Harvard Classics Computing Project $34,000 to purchase a 660 megabyte disk drive to store early versions of the TLG: the disk was the size of a washing machine, arrived in a wooden crate, needed a special disk controller, took two days for the technicians to install and required modifications to the version of the Unix operating system then available. The maintenance contract cost c. $4,000/year and was essential. As this introduction is written, $100 buys a terabyte of storage — more than 1000 times as much storage as its 1982 predecessor for 300 times less money, a decrease in cost of more than 300,000 in one quarter of a century.  We can now take for granted storage that was previously unimaginable, collecting huge digital images as well as texts and datasets with little regard for the costs of storage or computation. A generation ago, only a few of the wealthiest departments could raise tens of thousands of dollars to provide the storage to search a few million words of Greek and support the first generation of digital publishing. In 2008, many cell phones have more than enough storage and computational power to do much more.

And, of course, we already depend upon digital infrastructure for the paychecks, medical treatments and other fundamental components of material life.

We can do this in two ways.  First, we can create environments that more fully engage those already working with Greek and Latin — we have already begun to address this by creating searchable corpora of Greek and Latin, by making secondary sources available online as PDF files or by adding links between inflected words in a text and their dictionary entries and thus reducing time spent flipping large dictionaries. These all reduce the time between when we pose a question and when we receive an answer.  It would be hard to overstate the degree to which cost-benefit decisions, often unconscious, shape the directions that we take in our intellectual lives.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that this began to happen as soon as substantial bodies of Greek and Latin became available to the general public.  Perseus quickly received letters from students in isolated locations such as rural homes and naval vessels at sea who were using online lexica and texts.  Even more interesting, people who had studied Greek and Latin decades before found that the reading support tools available online gave them the support that they needed to begin reading Greek and Latin again.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">The first paragraph in the opening "Call to action" of the National Science Foundation’s 2007 "Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st Century Discovery"  calls for "an individualized health model of every human being for personalized health care delivery" (<a class="ref" href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf0728" onclick="window.open('http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf0728'); return false">"Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st Century Discovery"</a>, March 2008: page 5). Such models would open up new methods where doctors and patients could not only determine the best courses with which to treat disease but also to identify potential problems and predispositions in advance.  Health records that include decades of medical tests and case histories clearly raise daunting issues of confidentiality, but the potential benefits are enormous. Emergent cyberinfrastructure for health care includes thus both methods to represent our particular background in great detail and a major investment in maintaining personal privacy.

The speakers of an unbounded set of local languages communicate by learning one of these linguae francae — thus, the Chinese businessman in a Damascus hotel will probably carry on his business in English.  Classicists are more broad-minded but generally expect scholars to publish materials in English, French, German and Italian. Speakers of Croatian or Modern Greek must learn these languages if they are to gain access to most information about the Greco-Roman world.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">Classicists can, however, design their cyberinfrastructure from the start to be as portable as possible across multiple languages.  There are at least three basic strategies, the third and most important of which is peculiarly suitable to historical fields where primary sources are finite and heavily studied.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66">First, we need to be able to optimize machine translation for the field of classics.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e979">[45]</a> We can develop statistical models that capture the idiosyncrasies of documents about Greco-Roman culture.  We develop these models by adding markup, using a combination of manual and automated methods, to finite bodies of material as training sets.  Machine learning systems then scan these bodies and recognize that Alexandria usually refers to the city in Egypt and almost never to the suburb of Washington, DC, by that name. An ambiguous word such as “case” probably designates a grammatical case in a Greek grammar and a display case in a museum catalogue.  These domain specific features, once identified, can help general machine translation systems avoid many of the worst problems they face and improve the quality of their output.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p67">67</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p67">Second, we need to include as much basic information as we can in forms from which they can be converted into multiple languages.  Thus, if we represent birth and death dates in a generic form, we can then develop modules to represent that knowledge in multiple languages. <a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e986">[46]</a> Some ontologies such as the <a class="ref" href="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/" onclick="window.open('http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/'); return false">CIDOC-CRM</a> for museum objects and <a class="ref" href="http://www.ifla.org/vii/s13/frbr/frbr.pdf" onclick="window.open('http://www.ifla.org/vii/s13/frbr/frbr.pdf'); return false">FRBR</a> for books have been under development for years and can represent a great deal of basic background information.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e999">[47]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p68">68</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p68">Third, canonical literary texts attract very large amounts of labor.  We can use that labor to create databases of linguistic annotations that describe syntax (e.g., the subject and object of a verb), co-reference (e.g., which person is the subject of a particular verb), semantics (e.g., where does <em class="emph">oratio</em> correspond to "prayer" rather than "oration" or some other concept).  These annotations stored in treebanks and other linguistic databases not only allow us to put our understanding of Greek and Latin on a wholly new, quantifiable foundation but can resolve the ambiguities that bedevil machine translation and can ultimately support higher quality machine translation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e1015">[48]</a>   Such annotations are expensive but are, in effect, the digital successors to print editions.  Where print editors labored to resolve ambiguities and problems in the textual tradition, digital editors provide machine actionable annotations that resolve where possible ambiguities in the reconstructed texts.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p69">69</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p69">The problem of multilingual knowledge thus breaks down into language independent and language dependent phases.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p70">70</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p70">Knowledge bases (e.g., basic propositional statements) and linguistic annotation can be created by speakers of any language.  The tag sets of ontologies and annotation schemes are relatively contained and can themselves be translated, allowing authors to work entirely with Greek, Latin and their own primary languages:  the birthdate of a given author may be uncertain but that uncertainty can be represented in a general form by the speaker of any language.  We may differ in how we construe the syntax of a sentence, but anyone who knows Greek, regardless of their native language, can decide which word depends on which and represent this in a common format.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p71">71</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p71">Communities that want to make publications in their own languages accessible to wider audiences will have to develop the training sets for documents about classics. The results will not be perfect but readers can then use dictionary lookups and other translation aids to more closely study the original language.  Each language needs its own training sets but this approach will not only make publications in the traditional languages of publication accessible to wider audiences but will also open up publications in less widely read languages (e.g. Croatian and Dutch) to much larger audiences.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p72">72</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p72">Communities that want to be able to read basic knowledge about the Greco-Roman world in their own language will need machine translation that can be optimized for classics and language specific drivers that can convert the basic knowledge from ontologies into their language, and systems that can exploit the dense linguistic annotations available for major canonical source texts.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p73">73</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p73">The creation of knowledge bases designed from the start to flow from language to language would be a radical change from traditional scholarly practice.  Nevertheless, there are profound strategic reasons for this new form of scholarship in the two major classes of society that produce scholarship about the Greco-Roman world.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p74">74</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p74">Classical Greek and Latin are the foundational languages of Europe and were the languages of high culture and trans-European discourse until relatively recent times — in fact, Turkey, whatever its religious background, would only restore to Europe a region that had been lost to it from the past.  The European Union has a commitment to make the cultural heritage of its nations intellectually accessible to the widest possible audience.  This implies an infrastructure that maximizes what can be learned not only in English, French, German, and Italian, but in all of the other official languages of Europe.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2773e1034">[49]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p75">75</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p75">The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are, however, not only geographically distinct from Europe but are fashioning themselves into cosmopolitan societies, European in origin but creating new identities with roots from every civilization of humanity.  The United States has in particular identified Chinese and Arabic as the two strategic languages on which it will concentrate its resources.  While Europe concentrates on making its cultural heritage accessible to the speakers of its official languages, American scholars can take the lead in making classical antiquity increasingly accessible to speakers of Chinese, Arabic and other languages. Ultimately, the increased distribution of Greco-Roman cultural materials into many other languages will speed the complementary process of opening up materials in classical Chinese, Arabic, Sanskrit and other languages to speakers of English and other European languages.  Our larger goal must be to make the record of humanity accessible to everyone regardless of linguistic and cultural background.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p76">76</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p76">While a linguistically and culturally portable knowledge base about the Greco-Roman world may seem daunting, the tools already at hand allow us to rethink not only who can read and consume primary and secondary sources but who can contribute substantively to the field. <a class="ref" href="../000024/000024.html" onclick="window.open('../000024/000024.html'); return false">Blackwell and Martin’s essay</a> opens this collection by describing how the practices of undergraduates have begun to change. The rise of undergraduate research is arguably the most important and promising development for classics as a discipline since classics lost its privileged position.  Before we can appreciate the possibilities of the technology now available but not yet fully exploited, we need to see how much classicists have already begun to accomplish.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p77">77</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p77">Before turning to the prospects for undergraduate and more general non-specialist research in classics, we should emphasize that the collection of essays published here themselves illustrate the greatest achievement of classical philology in this digital world.  We now have a critical mass of classicists who are committed to building and exploiting the evolving digital infrastructure upon which all scholarship and teaching in our field will depend.  While discussions of digital humanities still revert to the problem of tenure and promotion, several of the contributors to this collection have already earned tenure by pursuing digital projects.  All of the authors here are able to review innovative forms of digital scholarship on its intellectual merits, neither penalizing or rewarding the use of digital technologies per se but assessing the degree to which the new work advances our ancient and unchanging goals to bring the Greco-Roman heritage in general and ancient Greek and Latin in particular ever more fully to life in the minds of the broadest audience possible.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p78">78</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p78">No one showed more vision and patience to create this community than our colleague and beloved friend, Allen Ross Scaife.  He showed the way with his own pioneering work on <cite class="title italic">Diotima</cite>, a digital representations of women in antiquity.  As director of the <cite class="title italic">Stoa</cite> from its founding until his death ten years later, Ross always understood that the greatest resource for any field was the people whom it attracted.  Ross supported, fostered, encouraged, and advanced careers that will continue now for decades and will shape other careers as well. "Do not lament," the Pericles of Thucydides (1.143.5) tells the Athenians, "houses and land but people, for it is not houses and land that acquire people but people who acquire them." The passing of Ross Scaife wounds the field of classics more deeply than would have the loss of everything that the field as a whole has produced. But the community that Ross fostered with intelligence, patience and love and that produced these essays is greater than any single achievement that their authors could ever produce.</div></div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d2773e129"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>The publications in this collection were the production of a workshop, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, on the subject of Cyberinfrastructure in the Classics in September 2007 (NSF GRANT INFO).
