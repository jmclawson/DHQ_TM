They then outline the background to this vision, from early engagements in web-based mapping for the Classics to recent, fast-paced developments in web-based, collaborative geography. The article concludes with a description of their own Pleiades Project (<a class="ref" href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/" onclick="window.open('http://pleiades.stoa.org/'); return false">http://pleiades.stoa.org</a>), which gives scholars, students and enthusiasts worldwide the opportunity to use, create and share historical geographic information about the Greek and Roman World in digital form.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The View From 2017</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">As I settle into my chair, a second cup of morning coffee in my hand, an expansive view of the eastern Mediterranean fades in to cover the blank wall in front of me. It's one of my favorite perspectives: from a viewpoint a thousand kilometers above the Red Sea, you can look north and west across an expanse that encompasses Jordan, Egypt and Libya in the foreground and Tunisia, Calabria and the Crimea along the distorting arc of the horizon. A simple voice command clears some of my default overlays: current precipitation and cloud cover, overnight news hotspots, and a handful of icons that represent colleagues whose profiles indicate they're currently at work. Now I see a new overlay of colored symbols associated with my current work: various research projects, two articles I'm peer-reviewing and various other bits of analysis, coding, writing and reading. These fade slowly to gray, but for two. Both of them are sprawling, irregular splatters and clumps of dots, lines and polygonal shapes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The view pivots and zooms to frame these two symbol groups. The pink batch indicates the footprint of one of the review pieces, a survey article comparing Greek, Roman and Arabic land and sea itineraries. The other group, in pale blue, corresponds to my own never-ending "Roman boundary disputes" project. In both cases, I've previously tailored the display to map findspots of all texts and documents cited or included, as well as all places named in notes or the cited modern texts and ancient sources. These two sets of symbols remain highlighted because potentially relevant information has recently appeared.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">I suspect the "hits" for the boundary disputes are just articles in the latest (nearly last) digitized Supplementband of the Pauly-Wissowa <em class="emph">Real-encyclopädie</em> to be delivered to subscribing libraries...nothing new from the old print version. I'll double-check that later. The more interesting results are illustrated when I switch focus to the itineraries article I'm reviewing. A new collection of colored symbols appear on the landscape, their intensity automatically varied to indicate likely similarity to the selected article. One particular subset jumps out at me: a series of bright red dots paralleling the southern bank of the Danube. They are connected by line segments and join up with a network of other points and lines that fan out northward into the space once occupied by the Roman province of Dacia. A new and extensive Roman-era itinerary has been discovered in Romania and published.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">I can't resist making some quick explorations. It's easy enough to select the new publication and ask for an extract of the itinerary's geography, as well as the place names in their original orthographies. I follow up with a request for the results of two correlation queries against all of the itineraries cited in the review article: how similar are their geographies and how similar are their place names? My programmatic research assistant reports back quickly: there's a strong correlation between the sequential locations in a portion of the new document and an overlapping portion of our only surviving copy of a Roman world map, the so-called "Peutinger Map", but the forms of several place names differ in some particulars.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e126">[1]</a> Another intriguing result shows that the distances between nodal points in the new itinerary are statistically consistent with those recorded in the Claudian-era inscribed itinerary from Patara in Turkey, the so-called <em class="emph">Miliarium Lyciae</em>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e137">[2]</a> I bundle up these results and the new article, and add them to the review project. I can attach a short note to the author about it later. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">But now it's time to teach. Another voice command stores the research stuff and clears the projected display, which reforms in two parts: another virtual globe draped with the day's lecture materials, and a largely empty grid destined to be slowly populated over the next half-hour by the various icons, avatars and video images of my students. I double-check that I'm set to do-not-disturb and lean back to review my lecture notes. Today, Caesar will cross the Rubicon. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The View, Explained (and what we have left out)</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">We've taken an equally imagined, but less frenetic, view of the scholarly future a
               decade from now as that recently sketched for freelance business consultants by [<a class="ref" href="#sterling2007">Sterling 2007</a>]. Nonetheless, we share with Sterling a number of common assumptions about the ways in which location will alter our next-decade information experiences, both at work and in private life. We envision a 2017 in which the geo-computing revolution, now underway, has intersected with other computational and societal trends to effect major changes in the way humanist scholars work, publish and teach. The rapid developments occurring at the intersection of geographic computing and web-based information technology cannot be identified with any single label, nor are they effectively described by any single body of academic literature. A variety of terms are in use for one or another aspect of this domain, including "web mapping", "neogeography", "social cartography", "the geoweb", "webGIS" and "volunteered geographic information". Those unfamiliar with this fast-moving field – one in which speculation and innovation are widespread – will gain some appreciation of its breadth and heterogeneity if they start their reading with [<a class="ref" href="#turner2006">Turner 2006</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#goodchild2007">Goodchild 2007</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#boll2008">Boll 2008</a>] and <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#hudson-smith2008">#hudson-smith2008</a></span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e179">[3]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">For humanists, general research tasks will remain largely unchanged: the discovery,
               organization and analysis of primary and secondary materials with the goal of communicating and disseminating results and information for the use and education of others.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e191">[4]</a> But we expect to see a more broadly collaborative regime in which a far greater percentage of work time is spent in analysis and professional communication, all underpinned by a pervasive, always-on network. Much of the tedious and solitary work of text mining, bibliographic research and information management will be handled by computational agents, but we will become more responsible for the quality and effectiveness of that work by virtue of how we publish our research results. Ubiquitous, less-obtrusive software will respond to our specific queries, and to the interests implied in our past searches, stored documents, cited literature and recently used datasets. The information offered us in return will be drawn from a global pastiche of digital repositories and publication mechanisms, surfacing virtually all new academic publication, as well as digital proxies for much of the printed, graphic and audio works now for sale, in circulation or on exhibit in one or more first-world, brick-and-mortar bookstores, libraries or museums. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">It would be impossible in an article-length treatment to produce a comprehensive history of geography and the classics, digital or otherwise. The non-digital, cartographic achievements of the field to 1990 were surveyed in detail by [<a class="ref" href="#talbert1992">Talbert 1992</a>]. Many of the projects discussed then have continued, diversified or gone digital, but there has not been to our knowledge a more recent survey. Developments on the complementary methodological axis of "Historical GIS" have been addressed recently in [<a class="ref" href="#gregory2002">Gregory 2002</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#knowles2002">Knowles 2002</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#knowles2008">Knowles 2008</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e256">[5]</a>  No conference series, journal or research center has yet been able to establish the necessary international reporting linkages to provide a regular review of classical geographical research (digital or otherwise), an increasingly urgent need in a rapidly growing subfield.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Readers will detect this gap (and the compounding effects of limited space and time) in three regrettable categories of omission. Firstly, we have been unable to address many important comparanda for other periods, cultures and disciplines, for example the China Historical GIS (<a class="ref" href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/" onclick="window.open('http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/'); return false">http://​www.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/</a>), the AfricaMap Project (<a class="ref" href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k28501" onclick="window.open('http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k28501'); return false">http://​isites.harvard.edu/​icb/​icb.do?keyword=k28501</a>), both spearheaded by Harvard's Center for Geographic Analysis. Secondly, our examples here are heavily weighted toward the English-speaking world; we have not been able to address such seminal efforts as the <span class="foreign i">Türkiye Arkeolojik Yerleşmeleri</span> (TAY) Projesi (Archaeological Settlements of Turkey Project: <a class="ref" href="http://tayproject.org/" onclick="window.open('http://tayproject.org/'); return false">http://tayproject.org/</a>). Finally, we cannot possibly grapple in this article with the burgeoning practice of GIS and remote sensing for large-scale site archaeology and regional survey, though we can point to examples of projects seeking to facilitate aggregation, preservation and discovery  of related data, including FastiOnline (<a class="ref" href="http://www.fastionline.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.fastionline.org/'); return false">http://www.fastionline.org/</a>), the Mediterranean Archaeological GIS (<a class="ref" href="http://cgma.depauw.edu/magis/" onclick="window.open('http://cgma.depauw.edu/magis/'); return false">http://cgma.depauw.edu/MAGIS/</a>) and OpenContext (<a class="ref" href="http://opencontext.org/" onclick="window.open('http://opencontext.org/'); return false">http://opencontext.org/</a>).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">On the other hand, the initial impact on historical work of the publication in 2000 of the <cite class="title italic">Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World</cite> (R. Talbert, ed., Princeton) has been assessed by a number of reviews in major journals, and significant works have since appeared that take it as the reference basis for classical geographic features (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#hansen2004">Hansen 2004</a>]). Planning for a digital, user-friendly version of the Atlas continues as an area of active discussion between the Ancient World Mapping Center at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill (<a class="ref" href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc" onclick="window.open('http://www.unc.edu/awmc'); return false">http://www.unc.edu/awmc</a>) and other parties. Meanwhile, the analog and digital materials that underpinned publication of the Atlas are the present focus of the authors' Pleiades project (see further, below). </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Primacy of Location: A Recent Example Drawn from Google</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The ability to identify and locate relevant items of interest is of prime importance to users of scholarly information systems, and geography is a core axis of interest. As Buckland and Lancaster put it in their 2004 D-Lib Magazine article:
       
       <blockquote><p>The most fundamental advantage of the emerging networked knowledge environment is that it provides a much-improved technological basis for sharing resources of all sorts from all sources. This situation increases the importance of effective access to information. Place, along with time, topic, and creator, is one of the fundamental components in how we define things and search for them. [<a class="ref" href="#buckland2004">Buckland 2004</a>]</p></blockquote>
               Indeed, to realize the vision we have outlined above, spatial information must become as easily searched — within, between and outside individual digital libraries — as HTML web pages are today. The Googlebot began crawling and indexing web-posted documents encoded in the Keyhole Markup Language (KML; <a class="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keyhole_markup_language" onclick="window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keyhole_markup_language'); return false">http://​en.wikipedia.org/​wiki/​Keyhole_Markup_Language</a>), as well as web feeds containing GeoRSS markup (<a class="ref" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georss" onclick="window.open('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georss'); return false">http://​en.wikipedia.org/​wiki/​Georss</a>) in late 2006 [<a class="ref" href="#ohazama2007">Ohazama 2007</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#schutzberg2007">Schutzberg 2007</a>]. Microsoft added similar support to its Local Search and Virtual Earth services in October 2007 (GeoWeb Exploration 2007). It is already safe to say that this is now a routine function for viable web search services. Henceforth, KML and GeoRSS resources on the Web will be found and indexed if they are surfaced via stable, discoverable URLs.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Obviously, much of the information that the web search providers seek to index is not in one of these geospatial formats. To determine the geographic relevance of web-facing content in HTML, MSWord and PDF files and the like, a process called geoparsing must be employed cf. [<a class="ref" href="#hill2006">Hill 2006</a>, 220]. Geoparsing entails first a series of steps, often called collectively "named entity recognition", in which proper nouns in unstructured or semi-structured texts are disambiguated from other words and then associated with known or notional entities of interest (e.g., places, persons, concepts). The potential of course exists for false identifications, ambiguous matches (i.e., one name for many discrete entities) and complete failures (e.g., due to the obscurity of a name or a referenced entity). Assuming some level of success in disambiguation and identification of geographic entities in a text, the next step is to associate coordinates with each named entity. Unless the textual source is itself a geographic gazetteer containing map coordinates that can be parsed accurately, the coordinates must be supplied from an external reference dataset that ideally holds the exact name variants occurring in the text as well as the geospatial coordinates; we must recognize that it will often be the case, especially with regard to primary sources and academic literature on historical topics, that such a reference dataset does not exist. Nonetheless, once coordinates are assigned to as many entities as possible, and the results are stored in an index with a link to the original document, mapping, geosearch and other geographic computations can be performed.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e323">[6]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Despite clear challenges and the real possibility of incomplete results for many texts (we shall consider an example below), we believe that geoparsing-based services will mature and diversify rapidly. By 2017, we expect that all web-facing textual resources will be parsed (rightly or wrongly) for geographic content. Audio and video works, where these can be machine-transcribed, will receive similar treatment, whether they are accompanied by extensive metadata or not. Some texts, especially those produced by academics and specialist communities will have coordinates encoded into the digital texts in a way that facilitates automatic extraction, making their geographic indexing relatively simple (e.g., KML, GeoRSS or the like). The majority of texts, however, will still have only geographic names and geographic description, most with neither special tagging nor authority control. The search engines will automatically identify these components and add associated entries to their geographic indexes by matching them with coordinate data in reference datasets. We believe that these datasets will include information drawn from KML and GeoRSS-enabled documents on the web, as well as previously geo-parsed texts (especially those whose genre, topic and regional nature are easily identified using automated techniques). Topic- and genre-aware geoparsing may well prove essential to accurate disambiguation of non-unique place names.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">The first fruits of geographic search are already apparent in information sets being
               surfaced to the web. Consider, for example, Google Books. A copy of J.S. Watson's
               1854 translation of Xenophon's <cite class="title italic">Anabasis</cite> was digitized at
               Harvard in June 2006. Bundled into the original print work by the publisher was W.F. Ainsworth's geographical commentary (pp. 263-338). Google's "About this book" page demonstrates the range of connections the search company's software is so far able to make between the book and other resources.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e367">[7]</a> Basic bibliographic metadata is surfaced, along with direct links to a downloadable PDF file and the Google book reader application (and thence to the optically-recognized text itself). A variety of links to other services are also provided (e.g., Amazon and OCLC WorldCat). Of chief interest in the present discussion are the geographic components introduced under the heading "Places mentioned in this book." These consist at present of a map and an index of select places, as illustrated in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>.
       
       <div id="figure1" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000031/resources/images/ShelbyPlacesFull.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000031/resources/images/ShelbyPlacesFull.png" alt="A screen shot of a Google map showing places mentioned."/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div></div></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">It would appear that most of the "places" currently highlighted in the Google
               Books presentation (evidently a maximum of 10) have been parsed from Ainsworth's
               commentary or the unattributed "Geographical Index", which we assume to be
               Watson's (pp. 339 - 348). As is the case with many Google search results, we are given no information about how the indexing or correlation with geographic coordinates (i.e., the geo-parsing) was accomplished. Some of the results are mapped correctly, but others have clearly gone awry. Consider, for example, the placement of Olympia, Syracuse and Tempe (see <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>).

The placement of these ancient features in North America illustrates one of the most obvious failure modes of geo-parsing algorithms. If the algorithm succeeds in finding a match at all, it may find more than one match or a single, but incorrect match. Given the information publicly available, we cannot know for certain which of these two circumstances produced the results in question here. It seems probable, however, that at least the Olympia and Syracuse errors result from selecting the wrong result of several, as both of these well-known sites appear in many of the standard gazetteers and geographic handbooks.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">There are published methods for resolving such ambiguities on the basis of proximity to other locations more reliably geo-parsed from the work, but these presuppose knowledge of a coherent geographic footprint for the work under consideration as well as a relatively comprehensive and highly relevant reference dataset that can provide at least a single match for most geographic names ([<a class="ref" href="#smith2001">Smith 2001</a>] and <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#smith2002">#smith2002</a></span>). Google has not revealed, to our knowledge, whether such self-calibrating algorithms are at work, but we can be certain that they do not have access to a comprehensive, highly relevant reference dataset for the ancient Greek world. Many datasets — including the <cite class="title italic">Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names</cite>, the <cite class="title italic">Alexandria Digital Library Gazetteer</cite> and the open-content <cite class="title italic">GeoNames database</cite><a class="noteRef" href="#d650e423">[8]</a> — contain significant numbers of historical Greek and Roman names; however, the authors' experience confirms that many ancient sites and regions are unaccounted for or incorrectly identified in these gazetteers, and many name variants and original-script orthographies are omitted.

The expansion of the Googlebot's competencies to include KML and GeoRSS expand the harvest potential to the entire web. This circumstance highlights a class of research and publication work of critical importance for humanists and geographers over the next decade: the creation of open, structured, web-facing geo-historical reference works that can be used for a variety of purposes, including the training of geo-parsing tools and the population of geographic indexes (see [<a class="ref" href="#elliott2006">Elliott 2006</a>]).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">The automated features outlined above were added to Google Books in January 2007.

       If the "Places in this book" component of Google Books is intended to help users explore the geography of the book, the Google Books layer in Google Earth offers users the opportunity to discover books by way of the geography. If, by chance, we should find ourselves browsing northeastern Turkey in Google Earth, the Google Books layer offers us a book icon in the vicinity of the town of İspir. This icon represents Watson's 1854 translation of the Anabasis. Links on the popup description kite will take us back to specific pages of the scanned Harvard copy we discussed above. Another link provides us with a way to "Search for all books referencing Ispir." On 30 September 2007, we were offered information about 706 books. By refining the search to include the keyword "ancient," we narrowed the result set to 167 books. We judged these results to be highly relevant to our interests. We then selected a further suggested refinement from a list of links at the bottom of the page: "Geography, Ancient." The resulting 7 matches are unsurprisingly spotty and largely out-of-date, given the current state of Google's book digitization project, copyright restrictions and the degree of publisher text-sharing partnerships.

A variety of services have come and gone since, some concentrating on screen display, others attempting to provide dynamic maps suitable for print. Some sites have provided scans of paper maps (like the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection: <a class="ref" href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.davidrumsey.com/'); return false">http://www.davidrumsey.com/</a>); others have served out digital remotely sensed imagery or readily printed static maps in PDF and other formats (the AWMC Maps for Students collection, for example: <a class="ref" href="http://www.unc.edu/awmc/mapsforstudents.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.unc.edu/awmc/mapsforstudents.html'); return false">http://​www.unc.edu/​awmc/​mapsforstudents.html</a>).

Until recently, however, the dominant paradigms for dynamic on-line maps comprised iterative, server-side map image generation, sometimes mediated by a client-side Java applet, in response to discrete mouse clicks. To one degree or another most such map tools emulate the look and feel of desktop GIS programs, perpetuating the thematic layering inherited from analog film-based cartographic composition.

We have only just grown accustomed to digital globes (like NASA WorldWind and Google Earth) and continuous-panning, "slippy" browser-side maps. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft Live Search and MapQuest have all gone this route, and there is now an excellent, open-source toolkit for building this sort of client-side maps: OpenLayers (<a class="ref" href="http://openlayers.org/" onclick="window.open('http://openlayers.org/'); return false">http://openlayers.org</a>). Many of these applications are doing more than giving us compelling new visual environments. Many of them are also breaking down traditional divisions between browse and search, thematic layers, web content, spatial processing and geographic datasets, not least through the mechanisms known generically as "mashups" (web applications that dynamically combine data and services from multiple, other web applications to provide a customized service or data product). These tools remain an area of intense, active development, so we should expect more pleasant surprises. Moreover, as the costs of projectors, large-format LCD displays and graphics cards fall, and as digital television standards encourage the replacement of older televisions, display sizes and resolutions will at last improve. Efficient techniques for the simple mosaicing of multiple display units and for the ad-hoc interfacing of mobile devices and on-demand displays provided by third parties expand the horizon still further.

Perseus was already in control of a significant amount of geographical information drawn from its texts through geo-parsing.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e566">[13]</a> This was further augmented from metadata associated with its coin and pottery databases. In the main, this dataset consisted of place names. A rudimentary digital gazetteer had been developed through computational matching of this names list with gazetteer records in various publicly-available US Government geographical datasets (especially the resource now known as the GEONet Names Server of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency), which provided coordinates. After some initial experimentation, the Perseus team selected an early version of MapServer to provide dynamic mapping, and by way of Perl and CGI, this was integrated with the existing Perseus tooling. Geographic data was stored in a plain PostgreSQL database, the PostGIS spatial data extension for PostgreSQL having not yet been developed. Vector linework and polygons from the Digital Chart of the World were added to provide geographic context.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">The Perseus Atlas saw two upgrades subsequent to its 1998 debut.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e582">[14]</a> The 2000 upgrade rolled out a rewritten and expanded Atlas that boasted several new features: global geographic coverage, a relief base layer, and tighter integration between the Atlas and the Perseus Lookup Tool.

A fork of the Atlas, designed to support the Historic London Collection, also appeared during this period.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e591">[15]</a> It offered essentially the same features, but employed a separate geographic datum, higher-resolution imagery and rudimentary temporal filtering capabilities by way of user-selectable, dated map layers.

At about the same time the Perseus team was conceptualizing its atlas as an interface to their entire, heterogeneous collection, the ADL vision was expanding to encompass geographic browsing and search in an entire digital library containing materials of all kinds, not just maps [<a class="ref" href="#goodchild2004">Goodchild 2004</a>]. A year after the Perseus Atlas appeared, the ADL vision of the "geo-library" was endorsed by the National Research Council Mapping Science Committee (National Research Council Mapping Science Committee 1999; see further [<a class="ref" href="#hill2006">Hill 2006</a>, 11–17]).

In May 2000, an executive order eliminated the intentional degradation of publicly accessible GPS signals, known as selective availability [<a class="ref" href="#office2000">Office 2000</a>]. This decision effectively placed unprecedentedly accurate geo-referencing and navigating capabilities in the hands of the average citizen (~15m horizontal accuracy).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">Work on the Stoa Waypoints Database was clearly informed by the Perseus Atlas Project, and also by another concurrent project at the Stoa: the Suda Online (SOL; <a class="ref" href="http://www.stoa.org/sol/" onclick="window.open('http://www.stoa.org/sol/'); return false">http://www.stoa.org/sol/</a>). This all-volunteer, collaborative effort undertook the English translation of a major Byzantine encyclopedia of significance for Classicists and Byzantinists alike. The Suda provides information about many places and peoples. An obvious enhancement to the supporting web application would have been a mapping system like the Perseus Atlas. In exploring the possibility, Scaife and Chavez realized that the variant place names in the Suda and in the Perseus Atlas were a significant impediment to implementation. The solution they envisioned in collaboration with Neel Smith was dubbed the Register of Geographic Entities (RAGE). They imagined an inventory of conceptual spatial units and a set of associated web services that would store project-specific identifiers for geographic features, together with associated names. This index would provide for cross-project lookup of names, and dynamic mapping. Some development work was done subsequently at the University of Kentucky [<a class="ref" href="#mohammed2002">Mohammed 2002</a>], and the most current version may be had in the Registry XML format currently under development by Smith and colleagues at the Center for Hellenic Studies via the CHS Registry Browser (cf., [<a class="ref" href="#smith2005">Smith 2005</a>]). At present, it contains just over 3,500 entries drawn almost entirely from Ptolemy's works and thus has so far not seen wide use as a general dataset for the classical world.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e829">[24]</a> The concern that informed the RAGE initiative remains valid: geographic interoperation between existing classics-related digital publications will require the collation of disparate, project-level gazetteers. It is our hope that, as Pleiades content is published, its open licensing and comprehensive coverage will catalyze a geo-webby solution.  </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Pleiades Project</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">Our own project, Pleiades (<a class="ref" href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/" onclick="window.open('http://pleiades.stoa.org/'); return false">http://pleiades.stoa.org</a>), is heavily influenced by both by the scholarly practices of our predecessors and by on-going developments in web-enabled geography. We are producing a standard reference dataset for Classical geography, together with associated services for interoperability. Combining VGI approaches with academic-style editorial review, Pleiades will enable (from September 2008) anyone — from university professors to casual students of antiquity — to suggest updates to geographic names, descriptive essays, bibliographic references and geographic coordinates. Once vetted for accuracy and pertinence, these suggestions will become a permanent, author-attributed part of future publications and data services. The project was initiated by the Ancient World Mapping Center at the University of North Carolina, with development and design collaboration and resources provided by the Stoa. In February 2008, the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World joined the project as a partner and it is there that development efforts for the project are now directed.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Pleiades may be seen from several angles. From the point of view of the Classical Atlas Project and its heir, the Ancient World Mapping Center, Pleiades is an innovative tool for the perpetual update and diversification of the dataset originally assembled to underpin the Barrington Atlas, which is being digitized and adapted for inclusion. From an editorial point of view, Pleiades is much like an academic journal, but with some important innovations. Instead of a thematic organization and primary subdivision into individually authored articles, Pleiades pushes discrete authoring and editing down to the fine level of structured reports on individual places and names, their relationships with each other and the scholarly rationale behind their content. In a real sense then Pleiades is also like an encyclopedic reference work, but with the built-in assumption of on-going revision and iterative publishing of versions (an increasingly common model for digital academic references). From the point of view of "neo-geo" applications, Pleiades is a source of services and data to support a variety of needs: dynamic mapping, proximity query and authority for names and places.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Pleiades incorporates a data model that diverges from the structure of conventional
               GIS datasets. Complexity in the historical record, combined with varying uncertainty in our ability to interpret it, necessitate a flexible approach sensitive to inherent ambiguity and the likelihood of changing and divergent interpretations (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#peuquet2002">Peuquet 2002</a>, 262–281]). In particular, we have rejected both coordinates and toponyms as the primary organizing theme for geo-historical data. Instead, we have settled upon the concept of "place" understood as a bundle of associations between attested names and measured (or estimated) locations (including areas). We call these bundles "features". Individual features can be positioned in time, and the confidence of the scholar or analyst can be registered with respect to any feature using a limited vocabulary.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">We intend for Pleiades content to be reused and remixed by others. For this reason, we release the content in multiple formats under the terms of a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license (<a class="ref" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" onclick="window.open('http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/'); return false">http://​creativecommons.org/​licenses/​by-sa/​3.0/</a>). The Pleiades website presents HTML versions of our content that provide users with the full complement of information recorded for each place, feature, name and location. In our web services, we employ proxies for our content (KML and GeoRSS-enhanced Atom feeds) so that users can visualize and exploit it in a variety of automated ways. In this way, we provide a computationally actionable bridge between a nuanced, scholarly publication and the geographic discovery and exploitation tools now emerging on the web. But for us, these formats are lossy: they cannot represent our data model in a structured way that preserves all nuance and detail and permits ready parsing and exploitation by software agents. Indeed, we have been unable to identify a standard XML-based data format that simply and losslessly supports the full expression of the Pleiades data model.<a class="noteRef" href="#d650e862">[25]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">In 2009, we plan to address users' need for a lossless export format by implementing code to produce file sets composed of ESRI Shapefiles and attribute tables in comma-separated value (CSV) format. The addition of a Shapefile+CSV export capability will facilitate a download-oriented dissemination method, as well as position us to deposit time-stamped versions of our data into the institutional repository at NYU and other archival contexts as appropriate.  Indeed, this is the most common format requested from us after KML. Although the Shapefile format is proprietary, it is used around the world in a variety of commercial and open-source GIS systems and can be readily decoded by third-party and open-source software. It is, in our judgment, the most readily useful format for individual desktop GIS users and small projects, and because of its ubiquity has a high likelihood of translation into new formats in the context of long-term preservation repositories. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">Historical time remains a problematic aspect of the web that cannot be divorced from geography. The use of virtual map layers to represent time periods remains a common metaphor. Timelines and animated maps are also not uncommon, but all these techniques must either remain tied to specific web applications or rely on cross-project data in standard formats that only handle the Gregorian calendar and do not provide mechanisms for the representation of uncertainty. Bruce Robertson's Historical Event Markup Language (HEML; <a class="ref" href="http://heml.mta.ca/" onclick="window.open('http://heml.mta.ca/'); return false">http://heml.mta.ca</a>) remains the most obvious candidate for providing the extra flexibility humanists need in this area, both for modeling and for expression in markup.

It is tragic indeed that we lost much too soon our friend and mentor Ross Scaife, who emerges as a pivotal figure in our narrative of this history. It was he who invited Elliott to the University of Kentucky in 2001 to give the first public presentation about the proposed Pleiades Project at the Center for Computational Studies, and it was he who provided the development server that supported the first two years of Pleiades software development. We are confident that, were Ross with us today as he was at the workshop that occasioned the original version of this paper, he would still be motivating us with challenging examples and stimulating ideas, connecting us with new collaborators and encouraging us to push harder for the changes we wish to see in our discipline.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">Despite the sense of loss that inevitably runs through the papers in this volume, and despite the challenges we face in a chaotic and interdisciplinary milieu, we also view the history of geographic computing and the classics as a hopeful omen for the future. We have a spectacular rising wave to ride: a wave of technological and societal change that may well help us conduct research and teach with more rigor and completeness than before while breaking down artificial boundaries between scholars in the academy and members of an increasingly educated and engaged public whose professional skills, public hobbies and personal interests coincide with ours at the fascinating intersection of humanity, space and time.</div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d650e126"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span> The most recent published work on the Peutinger map at the time of publication was [<a class="ref" href="#elliott2008">Elliott2008</a>], which looks forward to Richard Talbert's forthcoming digital edition of this unique primary source for the study of Roman cartography.

These assumptions spring from knowledge of work in a variety of fields. Web search customization, based on profiling, social bookmarking and other novel ranking schemes, has been an active area of research for over a decade, building on a venerable lineage of research in information retrieval and text mining.

Such a development, combined with methods for the virtual aggregation and linking of resources in a manner compatible with basic web architecture and indexing (e.g., OAI/ORE in Atom: <a class="ref" href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/atom-implementation.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/atom-implementation.html'); return false">http://​www.openarchives.org/​ore/​0.9/​atom-implementation.html</a>), would be of great service to humanities scholars (see further <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#cohen2008">#cohen2008</a></span>, [<a class="ref" href="#elliott2008a">Elliott 2008a</a>]).</div><div class="endnote" id="d650e693"><span class="noteRef">[20]</span>REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is an approach to the development of web services that seeks to exploit essential modes of web interaction to provide simpler, stabler and more open systems than traditional service-oriented architectures (see [<a class="ref" href="#tilkov2007">Tilkov 2007</a>] for a good introduction). It shares some principles with the linked data movement now championed by Tim Berners-Lee and others (see note 16 for references). The uneven uptake of REST in the geo-computing community was highlighted by links and comments in [<a class="ref" href="#gillies2008">Gillies 2008</a>]; note also this recent press release from ESRI, a leading developer of commercial GIS software: <a class="ref" href="http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/spring08articles/attendees-get.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/spring08articles/attendees-get.html'); return false">http://​www.esri.com/​news/​arcnews/​spring08articles/​attendees-get.html</a>. </div><div class="endnote" id="d650e737"><span class="noteRef">[21]</span>In private correspondence with Elliott, NGDA principals have expressed interest in eventual accession of Pleiades data, but to date no concrete requirements or processes have been articulated.</div><div class="endnote" id="d650e755"><span class="noteRef">[22]</span>See above, and note 3.</div><div class="endnote" id="d650e767"><span class="noteRef">[23]</span>The publicly open and collaborative aspects of VGI projects has sometimes led to the impression that use of the resulting data for serious geospatial work is irresponsible, not least because of perceptions of disregard for traditional forms of metadata (e.g., in a discussion thread on the closed-archive Maps-L discussion list in April 2007; subject line "Query: map and GIS user needs"). It may be that the inherently public aspect of VGI efforts makes it far easier to discover such oversights; however, we are not aware of any authoritative study addressing the issue in quantitative terms. There can be no doubt that many VGI datasets, and many of the web applications that enable their creation and use, fail to address issues as fundamental as precision, accuracy and data origin. It is particularly frustrating, for example, that content from Google's geo-aware photo sharing service, Panoramio (<a class="ref" href="http://www.panoramio.com/" onclick="window.open('http://www.panoramio.com/'); return false">http://www.panoramio.com/</a>), is surfaced in Google Earth with no reflection of its spatial accuracy. This despite the fact that Panoramio content includes both images that were geo-tagged manually using an arbitrarily scaled map interface and images whose EXIF headers originally contained high-resolution coordinates and other metadata provided automatically by GPS-enabled digital cameras. On the other hand, an increasing number of VGI projects whose technical staff include academic or professional geographers are addressing these concerns and finding innovative ways to solve them in the new media.</div><div class="endnote" id="d650e829"><span class="noteRef">[24]</span>Of course the primary source of delay for RAGE was the lack of availability of a comprehensive set of coordinates, identifiers and names around which to array the content of other gazetteers. The Barrington Atlas constitutes such a resource, but has not been available in an appropriate form, nor under a suitable license that would permit such reuse. Elliott and Gillies, in collaboration with others (including Smith) and with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.K. Joint Information Systems Committee have recently devised and promulgated a list of identifiers and name strings for every discrete geographic feature in the Barrington Atlas (see [<a class="ref" href="#elliott2008b">Elliott 2008b</a>]). Projects and publishers are encouraged to use these identifiers in their digital datasets; the Pleiades project aims to establish a web service for linking these identifiers to its online coordinate and name data as it is digitized. Linking or incorporation of the Ptolemaic information now in the RAGE registry will thereafter be a straightforward matter.</div><div class="endnote" id="d650e862"><span class="noteRef">[25]</span>The original Pleiades proposal, written in 2005, anticipated that the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) Gazetteer format (<a class="ref" href="http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/gazetteer/contentstandard/version3.2/gcs3.2-guide.htm" onclick="window.open('http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/gazetteer/contentstandard/version3.2/gcs3.2-guide.htm'); return false">http://​www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/​gazetteer/​ContentStandard/​version3.2/​GCS3.2-guide.htm</a>) would provide an export and archiving vehicle (Elliott had supplied comments to the joint ADL and ECAI teams that developed the gazetteer format with this use in mind).  We went so far as to propose that Pleiades would support the full ADL Gazetteer Protocol for the exchange of such data.  Unfortunately, development of this putative standard seems to have stalled with the retirement of its primary research leader (a Pleiades Steering Committee member), and to our knowledge it has not seen significant adoption outside its original application in the Alexandria Digital Library and a few closely collaborating historical-cultural academic projects. In our view, its complex and deeply hierarchical XML file structure lost ground in competition with the Open GIS (OGC) Consortium’s detailed Geography Markup Language (in use by government and commercial GIS entities) and the lightweight KML format introduced by Google Earth. Recently introduced guidance for the description of "places" (in addition to "place names") by the Text Encoding Initiative might provide another "lossless" alternative, but  it seems unlikely to see wide adoption outside scholarly humanities circles (see TEI Consortium 2008, sub "13.
