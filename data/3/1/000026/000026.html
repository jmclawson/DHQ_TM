        information, searching on it or visualizing it. The Historical Event Markup and Linking
        Project (Heml) was begun six years ago to explore how disparate historical materials on the
        Internet can be navigated and visualized, and for the past four years has used an XML data format defined in W3C Schemas. 
        This format aims for conforming data that can be
        quickly parsed but provide a variety of facets on which to search for historical materials.
        While the project's graphical visualizations are in some respects successful, they have revealed some
        deficiencies in the underlying data format: it ought to provide for nested events, it ought to represent relations
        of causality between events and it ought to express the varieties of scholarly opinion about the attributes of events. By encoding the
        Heml data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) it is possible to undertake these
        improvements. Moreover, an RDF-encoded Heml process provides easier access to
        CIDOC-CRM data into Heml events. Finally, a historical RDF language would simplify the discovery of references to historical events 
        in digitized texts, thereby automating a
        growing network of historical information on the Web.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Beginning his work which was to be the first called a "history", the Greek author
        Herodotus describes his task in simple terms: "to preserve the memory of the past by putting
        on record the astonishing achievements both of our own and of other peoples" (line 1.0). Within
        the first few chapters, though, it becomes clear that, to Herodotus, this entails something
        more multivalent than mere story-telling. His very next sentence buttresses the narrative
        with references to its various, even conflicting, sources 1.1; not much later, he corroborates
        his stories by referring to physical artifacts and providing careful genealogies 1.7, 1.14; and
        throughout he attempts to place the notable events of the past within the available
        chronological outlines (e.g, 16.1). From its origins, then, history has been conducted across a
        framework of argumentation, evidence, chronology and prosopography.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This intellectual approach, begun by Herodotus and his rough contemporaries around the
        world, has proved a durable and useful way of thinking. Moreover, as the global Internet
        expands, and the common software technologies of the World Wide Web provide us with
        unprecedented means of communication, humanity has greater access to more historical
        statements and more of the raw materials of history than ever before. Indeed, it might be said that
        today's Web has the makings of an historian's fantasy: it provides worthy encyclopedia
        entries on a vast array of topics; its textual editions are rapidly improving in quality and
        amassing in quantity; and it offers historical source material ranging from argumentation in
        on-line editions of the best journals to the first-hand accounts appearing in blog entries.
        Scholarly historical projects published uniquely on the Web are common, supported by
        academic centres whose purpose is to communicate history effectively in new media, and who are
        also addressing the general problems of adopting best standards of scholarship to the Web in
        projects such as <a class="ref" href="http://www.zotero.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.zotero.org/'); return false">Zotero</a>. Behind the scene, data
        formats such as the CIDOC-CRM aim to make it possible to interchange and reconcile vast
        cultural archives. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3"> However what today's Web offers in historical content, it lacks in organization. The
        multivalent nature of historical thought that we noted in one of its earliest practitioners
        eludes the keyword-indexed approach to the Web today on offer through Google and other
        search engines. Though we can summon up an exhaustive list of Web resources that contain the
          <em class="emph">words</em>"Gallipoli" and "sources", today's Web cannot effectively respond to a
        basic historical question such as, "which sources attest the Gallipoli Campaign of World War
        I?" much less a more advanced one such as, "what evidence is there for major architectural
        projects undertaken in the U.K. during the period of the Boer War, and does anyone think
        that these projects are influenced by the conflict?" If it were possible to conduct such a
        query, of course the result would not itself qualify as "history" any more than the results
        of a Google search constitute knowledge. However, the results of such a hypothetical search
        would offer a considerable aid to historical research and thinking, just as the indices,
        maps and, occasionally, tables that appear at the end of most monographs allow the reader
        rapidly to access matters of interest. Applying this analogy, what is needed in the Web is
        "universal back-matter", a Web-wide equivalent to the traditional print monograph's helpful conventions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d22963e137">[1]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Herodotus and his successors have given us a template for such a project.
        Minimally, it will need to express associations between words describing the event through  chronology, geography and prosopography. It will need to provide
        references to diverse sources and evidence, and it will need to traverse, as much as
        possible, the boundaries of local language and even local time-keeping
              techniques.<a class="noteRef" href="#d22963e154">[2]</a> Indeed, over fifteen years ago, the prescient Historian's Workstation
        Project employed the same basic types of data [<a class="ref" href="#thaller1991">Thaller
      1991</a>]; however, the Internet has added the challenge of working
        with a more heterogeneous set of data sources and today's possibilities for the
        visualization of historical data go far beyond the Workstation's.<a class="noteRef" href="#d22963e167">[3]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5"> The Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (Heml) has pursued the vision of a system
        such as this since 2001, when it began to explore the markup and transformation of
        historical materials on the Internet using XML tools. All schemas and code developed by this
        project are available at its website, <a class="ref" href="http://www.heml.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.heml.org/'); return false">http://www.heml.org/</a> and complete revision history is provided in an SVN repository.
        This paper explains Heml's next step toward the goal of an historical Web. It outlines the
        data format used by the project, shows the shortcomings of our previous XML-based approach
        to historical markup and describes the potential of an historical markup scheme based around
        the W3C's Resource Description Framework, or <a class="ref" href="http://www.w3.org/tr/rec-rdf-syntax/" onclick="window.open('http://www.w3.org/tr/rec-rdf-syntax/'); return false">RDF</a>, to interchange historical
        concepts widely and to express them in a more nuanced manner. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">It is a pleasure to be able to offer this paper in the collection of works celebrating the
        achievements of Ross Scaife. Like so many efforts in computing and the Classics, this one
        has been nurtured by Ross' kind support and encouragement. Furthermore, I have always hoped
        that Heml would attain the level of openness and helpfulness that are the hallmarks of Ross'
        work and of his character.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Heml Data Model</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The goal of a searchable network of historical information can only be reached through a
        clear separation between the model of the data being searched, the parameters of the search
        and the resulting visualization of the data. Since the project intends that these
        visualizations be generated dynamically in response to users' queries, the data model must
        be specific enough that the visualization can generated quickly; likewise, since the results
        of users' queries could result in no events, one event, or thousands of events, and the range of values
        represented in these encoded events could be quite wide, the visualization processes must be
        written so as to generate useful views without regard for the number of events visualized or
        how close or far they are in time and space. For this reason, the Heml project has attempted
        to steer a middle path between pragmatism and markup idealism, especially regarding
        chronology. Thus, its data schema, on one hand, is not a complete abstraction of any way in
        which a person might think of the past, since this would make the task of visualization too
        daunting. In particular, its schema requires machine-readable data for all defined
        geographical and chronological data. (As shown below, this does not preclude the schema
        representing uncertainty.) On the other hand, the schema is not merely an API for the
        various visualizations offered by Heml; it is abstract enough that many other visualizations
        and uses could be discovered.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8"> At its inception, the Heml server software transformed XML documents one-by-one
            [<a class="ref" href="#robertson2002">Robertson 2002</a>]; in versions 0.4 to 0.7.2 the project adopted a distributed XML
        model, backed up by the <a class="ref" href="http://www.exist-db.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.exist-db.org/'); return false">eXist</a> XML database
            [<a class="ref" href="#robertson2004">Robertson 2004</a>], an approach that worked
        well in a collaboration with Tom Costa's project, <a class="ref" href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/" onclick="window.open('http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/'); return false"> Geography of Slavery in Virginia</a>, where
        a Heml Web application backed by eXist transforms events pertaining to slaves into hundreds
        of dynamically generated maps and timelines. In either case, the project's data model has
        remained the same for the past four years, and the following describes the model labelled
        2003-09-17.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9"> The Heml data format contains a collection of modelled events, each tagged with
        <span class="monospace">heml:Event</span>. At their most simple, events bind an event label with a
        machine-readable span of time and a reference to evidence, which could be as simple as a
        single URN. Optionally, a <span class="monospace">heml:Event</span> may also comprise any number of keywords,
        and a single location, which in turn is defined as a labelled pair of latitude and longitude
        coordinates. <span class="monospace">heml:Person</span> elements may be added to events in order to represent
        those people who were in some way involved in the event. If the nature of this participation
        is known, the <span class="monospace">heml:Person</span> element may be bound to a <span class="monospace">heml:Role</span>
        element within the context of the event. Persons, roles, locations, and keywords are
        assigned mandatory URIs so that they may be referred to in multiple events. Finally, one or
        more <span class="monospace">heml:Evidence</span> elements must be attributed to each event, and within these
        there is a means by which different editions and linguistic representations of the same text
        may be grouped together for the researcher's benefit.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Chronology</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">The most complex part of Heml's data model is the <span class="monospace">heml:Chronology</span> element.
          Its model is intended to express uncertainty and ranges of time without requiring the
          visualization engine to have access to all data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d22963e232">[4]</a> In Heml markup, chronological concepts are always built using one of the following
          four elements: <span class="monospace">heml:DateTime</span>, <span class="monospace">heml:Date</span>, <span class="monospace">heml:Year</span>
          or <span class="monospace">IntCalDate</span>. The first three of these encapsulate data encoded in the
          corresponding XML Schemas format; the last permits the user to encode with a non-Gregorian
          calendar. When used alone, these elements are  meant to indicating a corresponding span
          of time: for instance the <span class="monospace">&lt;heml:Year&gt;-31&lt;heml:Year&gt;</span> indicates
          an event that began on the first second of the first day of 31 BC and ended on the last
          second of its last day. To express a more expanded range of time, the
          <span class="monospace">heml:DateRange</span> element is used, and within it mandatory
            <span class="monospace">heml:StartingDate</span> and <span class="monospace">heml:EndingDate</span> elements. This construct
          is parsed as indicating a span of time beginning at the beginning of the first element and
          ending at the ending of the last one. To express uncertainty, the
          <span class="monospace">heml:BoundedDate</span> element is used. It comprises a
          <span class="monospace">heml:TerminusPostQuem</span> and a <span class="monospace">heml:TerminusAnteQuem</span> element; these
          express the earliest possible and latest possible time respectively of a span of uncertain
          time. Use alone, <span class="monospace">heml:BoundedDate</span> makes no claim about the duration of the
          encoded event. However, it is permitted to use a <span class="monospace">heml:BoundedDate</span> within the
            <span class="monospace">heml:StartingDate</span> or <span class="monospace">heml:EndingDate</span> of a

          all such P5 <span class="monospace">event</span> elements must appear within a <span class="monospace">person</span> or <span class="monospace">place</span> element, 
          expressing that the event information serves to further our information about a given person or place: 
          events that pertain to neither at present cannot be encoded.

          Finally, the <a class="ref" href="http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/" onclick="window.open('http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr/'); return false">CIDOC-CRM</a> encodes
          descriptions of cultural artifacts in terms of the events they undergo — their creation, change of
          custody, and so forth. Though not the primary focus of this schema, historical events are quite broadly modelled in this schema.
          Indeed, as is shown below, the unmodified CIDOC-CRM model is too liberal for the Heml Project's purposes of generating historical visualizations, especially with reference to what entities and datatypes it accepts as chronological predicates. Nevertheless, it is likely that most of the goals of the 
          Heml project can be fulfilled through RDFS subclassing of the the CIDOC-CRM model, ensuring more carefully data-typed chronological
          classes. In any case, the discussion and examples below would apply as well to such a constrained CIDOC-CRM model or to any future schema with similar properties.
          Indeed, the purpose of the Heml project is decidedly not to promote a particular schema; instead, its schema is intended as a tool which enables us to explore the process of combining all material encoded in all these well-entrenched and widely-adopted 
          schemas so as to increase the pool of inter-related historical data on the Internet.

        emulating a graphical timeline in print. In fact, the
        rendering software iterates through layout scenarios in order to find one that is appropriately  compact
        but whose text is still possible to read. It ensures that the entire text labelling an event is always visible
        to the user, and scrolling is not necessary to read the event label. The software also selects an appropriate range of

        optimize layout. Rather, its documentation encourages users to identify so-called "hot zones", temporal ranges 
        comprising unusually large
        numbers of  events so that the drawing routine can alter the scale in these ranges, thereby producing a more
        legible layout. The goals of the Heml project, requiring a fully automated rendering, do not make such hand-tweaking possible.
        However, Simile timeline's excellent use of client-side rendering and DHTML are certainly preferable to the Heml timeline approach.

        pointed out some deficiencies in the underlying data model. <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>, for
        example, presents an apparent mishmash of events. Perhaps the user undertook a too-broad
        query, but when dealing with any large dataset this sort of result is common because the XML
        schema puts all events, no matter how trivial, on the same footing. It has therefore been
        suggested that events should be ranked, or should nest, with large scale events such as "The
        Persian Wars" expressed as parents of their composite events, like "The Battle of
        Thermopylae." In response to publications and presentations of the Heml/XML model, others
        have expressed a desire for more complex historical relations between events to be encoded.
        Should not Heml express something as simple as causality, such as the fact that Ephialtes'
        treachery led to the defeat of the Three Hundred? Finally, it has been noted that with Heml/XML
        markup it is not possible to encode the variations in opinions regarding historical
        events. When scholars debate the date of the arrival of the Greek-speaking ancestors of the
        Mycenaeans, what date should be encoded for this event?</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Some of these issues have  been tackled recently by [<a class="ref" href="#nakahira2007">Nakahira 2007</a>], but in the Heml XML Schema they were intentionally left unaddressed for both theoretical
        and practical reasons. First, it has been this project's experience that resolving such
        relations with a language such as <a class="ref" href="http://www.w3.org/tr/xquery/" onclick="window.open('http://www.w3.org/tr/xquery/'); return false">XQuery</a> or
        XSLT was difficult and computationally expensive. Secondly, since the XML Schema expresses
        matters pertaining to an event by nested elements, it was unclear where a statement linking
        two elements should appear. Pertaining no more to one element than the other, ideally it
        should stand outside the <span class="monospace">heml:Event</span> elements, but this raised the prospect of
        always new schemas required to provide metadata for previous schemas. Finally, a XML schema
        through which scholarly debate could be encoded for any facet of an event seemed likely to
        be unmanageably complex.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">RDF and Heml</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Our work of the past year shows that these problems can be addressed by using the W3C's
        Resource Description Framework (RDF) as our means of encoding Heml events and related information.<a class="noteRef" href="#d22963e433">[6]</a> As a collection of statements expressed through URIs, RDF is well suited to define
        metadata that expresses associations between events. Because these statements are unordered,
        these associations can be asserted in any source of data, anywhere. Moreover, RDF defines a
        method known as "reification" whereby a statement comprising Subject Verb and Object can
        itself play the role of subject or object in another, encompassing statement. <a href="#example02">Example 2</a> illustrates the process with an example from Greek prehistory. The
        first line makes a simple statement, without attribution, that the ancestors of the
        Mycenaeans arrived in the Greek mainland in 1600 BC. The second line indicates the
        reification of that statement with parentheses, and attributes this chronology to Drewes
        with the <span class="monospace">hemlRDF:asserts</span> predicate. The third line refers to the same
          <span class="monospace">&lt;#Arrival_of_the_Greeks&gt;</span> subject, but it shows that Renfrew assigns

        For example, the chronology of fifth-century Athens could be encoded
        with reference to the arguments of Badian or those of Pritchett. This technique becomes all the more important
        when even more tendentious predicates are applied, such as causation.

          project proposes next to remove the XML format entirely from its processing pipeline.
          Ideally, we wish to follow the general trends of Web computing and pass all processing
          over to the client; it will occasionally call its server for additional RDF data. The
          proposed architecture is illustrated in <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>. <div id="figure05" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000026/resources/images/figure05.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000026/resources/images/figure05.jpg" alt="The process stack of Heml"/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 5. </div>Block Diagram of the Components of the Projected Heml Software</div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 5. </div>Future Heml Software Development Will Aim to Do All Processing on the

          Although its data store and communication are modelled in RDF, this system still
          can consume any (non-RDF) XML that is of historical interest, such as the biographical P5
          TEI tags. An appropriate XSLT stylesheet converts such materials to XML-encoded RDF.
          Finally, since it appears that declarative animation in the SVG format is being abandoned,
          Heml will explore other vector graphics formats and likely use the popular cross-platform
          Flex3 platform from Adobe. We are also adopting  of third-party visualization
          tools that have arisen in recently, such as <a class="ref" href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/" onclick="window.open('http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/'); return false">Simile Timeline</a> and the 
          <a class="ref" href="http://www.openlayers.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.openlayers.org/'); return false">OpenLayers</a> mapping
          suite.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">The combination of the SPARQL query language and RDF is reasonably powerful, but it lacks some temporal capabilities which we have had 
          to add through extension functions written for the Joseki SPARQL server engine. For instance, while the SPARQL specification permits the 
          query to request a response that is ordered by one or more datatyped values, the only temporal datatype that it will order in this way is 
          <span class="monospace">xsd:DateTime</span>, that is, dates specified to the second; the specification does not indicate how to order dates specified to 
          the year or day, much less to compare between these datatypes. Our extension function uses <a class="ref" href="http://jena.hpl.hp.com/~afs/sparql-update.html" onclick="window.open('http://jena.hpl.hp.com/~afs/sparql-update.html'); return false">SPARQL Update</a> 
          to apply to the in-memory RDF graph a starting and ending <span class="monospace">xsd:DateTime</span> corresponding
          to the beginning and ending of the chronological ranges indicated by these other datatypes. Further improvements in chronological analysis could
          be made through the use of the CIDOC-CRM's predicates based on Allen temporal logic [<a class="ref" href="#allen1983">Allen 1983</a>] and further use of SPARQL/Update.<a class="noteRef" href="#d22963e662">[10]</a></div><div class="div div2"><h3 class="head">Projected Work</h3><div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">Finally, we plan to undertake the automated discovery of references to historical events
            in unexplored digitized texts. We can expect these texts to be created in ever-increasing
            numbers, either by large-scale endeavours like the Open Archive Initiative, by the Google
            Books project, or through local efforts such as the one described in [<a class="ref" href="#carrera2005">Carrera 2005</a>], which become more practical as improved Optical Character Recognition
            software is developed in large-scale endeavours. The method described below was inspired
            by Greg Crane, whose published thoughts on the topic began in <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#crane2006">#crane2006</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33"><span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#smith2002">#smith2002</a></span> and the work of the <a class="ref" href="http://www.timeml.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.timeml.org/'); return false">TimeML</a> group show how effectively extracted named
            entities and natural language processing techniques can be used to identify events.
            While these natural language processing approaches discover hitherto unidentified events
            — typically from newspaper articles — 
            we intend to  apply some of the same machine
            learning techniques to discover references to <em class="emph">canonical</em> events,
            already encoded and stored in HemlRDF. (Such canonical events would be extracted from
            standard reference works.) This system thus could train linear classifiers with the persons and places associated with an event, as well as other additional features encoded in HemlRDF. For instance, the appearance of a reference to
            a primary source already associated with an event would be a strong indication that that
            event is being discussed.  While in some disciplines it would be a considerable task to
            accurately identify such references with the one on record in the RDF database, Smith's
            work on <a class="ref" href="http://chs75.harvard.edu/projects/diginc/techpub/cts" onclick="window.open('http://chs75.harvard.edu/projects/diginc/techpub/cts'); return false">Canonical
