                        It New in New Media</cite> (2014) emphasizes the field-building
                    significance of Pressman’s innovative approach to analyzing electronic
                    literature, an approach that reinvigorates the dated methods of New Criticism
                    for use in the digital humanities. Pressman identifies a genre of contemporary
                    electronic literature, "digital modernism," and
                    uncovers continuities linking it with early twentieth-century modernism. In
                    spite of an uneven style that oscillates between belabored scholasticism and
                    brilliant description, <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite> rigorously
                    wrangles a wide array of data points — historical, literary, and technological —
                    to create an account of contemporary electronic literature relevant for digital
                    humanists, literary scholars, and New Media scholars. This review contextualizes
                    the work within new currents in modernist scholarship, reflects on the modernism
                    and digital modernist "canon" Pressman assembles, and then
                    provides chapter summaries, with an emphasis on <cite class="title italic">Digital
                        Modernism</cite>’s reinvention of close reading for the twenty-first
                    century.</p></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Jessica Pressman’s <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism: Making It New in New
                    Media</cite> is an innovative, indispensable, and far-ranging work that
                contextualizes a compact canon of contemporary digital literature within the broader
                twentieth-century modernist tradition of artistic engagement with new media. Bogged
                down by a plodding scholarly proceduralism, the book’s conscientious tone nearly
                muffles a series of lively readings of digital literature. <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite>’s impressive interdisciplinarity, which combines
                principles from a variety of "new" fields — New Media Studies,
                New Modernist Studies, and New Criticism — is brought to bear on works by William
                Poundstone, Young-Hae Change Heavy Industries (YHCHI), Erik Loyer, Talan Memmott,
                Judd Morrissey, and Mark Z. Danielewski. Pressman argues that these works not only
                contain "immanent critiques of their technocultural
                    context"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 156], but also enable us "to
                    see more clearly the world of print"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 54]. Refashioning Marshall McLuhan, father of New
                Media Studies, as a midcentury axis or conceptual medium capable of reaching
                backward to modernism and forward to digital culture, Pressman achieves nothing less
                than a new vision of the intellectual and artistic history of new media and
                technology. "What is at stake," she boldly claims, "is nothing short of a better understanding of the significance of
                    literary art, critical reading practices, and humanistic culture in a our
                    networked age"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 27]. Due to Pressman’s fierce advocacy of close
                reading, <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite>’s conceptual eclecticism
                does not impede the clarity of her vision, but it comes at the cost of a narrowness
                in the scope of literary works she investigates — in ways she sometimes compensates
                for and, at other times, does not. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2"><cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite>’s opening salvo, Mark Wollaeger and
                Kevin J. Dettmar’s remarkably sassy Series Editors’ Foreword, is structured as a
                FAQ. Anticipating knee-jerk rejections of Pressman’s choice of modernism rather than
                postmodernism as the appropriate period concept for digital literature, the foreword
                reminds us that only a now-defunct distinction between "highbrow"
                and "lowbrow" art buoyed up theories separating modernism from
                postmodernism. "This isn’t the 1980s anymore"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, x], they only half-jokingly growl, in a way that
                is likely puzzling to those without disciplinary training in modernism. Behind this
                impatience is New Modernist Studies, an interdisciplinary, cultural
                studies-inflected approach to modernist literature dating from 1994 with the
                founding of the journal <cite class="title italic">Modernism/modernity</cite> and the
                inaugural Modernist Studies Association (MSA) Conference in 1999. The journal’s
                inaugural issue announces an interdisciplinary editorial approach grounded in
                modernists’ insistence that "changes in the arts be viewed in
                    conjunction with changes in philosophy, historiography, and social theory, to
                    say nothing of the scientific shifts that they claimed as part of their moment's
                    cultural revolution"[<a class="ref" href="#rainey1994">Rainey and von Hallberg 1994</a>, 1]. The MSA Conference crystallized this approach
                by expanding the canon, addressing issues of class, gender, sexuality, race, and
                empire, and emphasizing technology and new media. Pressman’s book seems to fit in
                because it reshapes modernism in light of digital culture and dovetails with the
                latest New Modernist criticism, which has expanded the traditional historical and
                geographical boundaries of what is considered to be "modernist."<a class="noteRef" href="#d2152e152">[1]</a> Ultimately, the Foreword’s feisty pugilism,
                like Clint Eastwood in <cite class="title italic">Dirty Harry</cite>, dares you to make
                their day by claiming that Pressman does not subscribe to the policies of canonical,
                temporal, and spatial expansionism under two decades of New Modernist Studies.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3"><cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite>’s central insight — that a new genre,
                    "digital modernism," remixes older works of literary modernism to flout
                expectations of contemporary electronic literature — supports these diversifying
                efforts. But Pressman’s modernist canon privileges the usual suspects of Ezra Pound,
                James Joyce, and T. S. Eliot, hearkening back to the "bad
                    modernism" of pre-1994 scholarship.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2152e172">[2]</a> The same can be said about Pressman’s digital
                canon, which features authors who have already attracted scholarly attention (the
                fêted YHCHI appears in two chapters) and whose conscious literariness makes them
                legible to traditional scholarship. With this caveat, we can answer their parting
                question, "Should I not only read this book but also assign it
                    in classes and give it to all my friends and family?"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, x], in the affirmative answer (though it
                certainly depends on one’s family).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The foreword’s cheekiness does not offset the stiffness that calcifies much of the
                book inside its stringently cultivated framework of signposts, justifications, and
                qualifications. This is particularly true of the dauntingly learned Introduction,
                which, with its fifteen-page section "Defining My Terms"
                (itself divided into five subsections) prefacing sections on "The Stakes of My Argument,""Critical Influences," and "Chapter
                    Summaries," reads like a book prospectus and distances readers from the
                clear, dynamic, and ingenious close readings yet to come. That the Introduction
                skips from "Part II" straight to "Part IV" suggests that even an Oxford University Press copyeditor cannot
                keep this structural rabbit warren straight. Of course, the micromanaging
                Introduction has a serious purpose: to convince serious readers that electronic
                literature is serious stuff. Pressman explains, <blockquote><p>There is a countermovement underway, this book argues, a
                        serious effort to encourage digital literature to be taken seriously....
                        [T]he majority of this book focuses on Internet-based literature in order to
                        show how and why one of the most maligned of literary spaces, the web — one
                        accused of fostering reading habits that destroy deep attention and devalue
                        hermeneutic analysis — is actually the place where serious literature stages
                        its rebellion and renaissance. [<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 8–9]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">This is indeed an important task, and Pressman is equal to it. Her close readings of
                digital literature do "reward" (one of her key terms) her
                attention, and they do "renovate" (another key term)
                modernism by revealing its imbrication in contemporary digital culture. "Remediate" completes the core lexicon of <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite>, which adds to Bolter and Grusin’s
                concept [<a class="ref" href="#bolter2000">Bolter and Grusin 2000</a>] a new affordance: close reading. Pressman’s
                comparison of early twentieth-century modernism and contemporary digital modernism
                reveals that remediation is both a product of and an invitation to close reading,
                which "rewards" critical attention by "renovating" texts and technologies. In doing so, <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism </cite>effectively remediates not just
                modernist new media, but indeed close reading itself — hence this review’s
                title.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The Introduction responsibly, if ponderously, hits its required disciplinary beats by
                defining modernism, electronic literature, digital modernism, close reading, and New
                Criticism. Readers from a variety of fields are swiftly caught up to speed, ensuring
                the book’s accessibility to a broad audience. In defining close reading as a "careful application of focused attention to the formal operations
                    in a literary text"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 11], Pressman strikes a strong blow in the battle
                quantitative formalism now wages against close reading.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2152e242">[3]</a> A close reading-positive critic, she claims
                that her texts inherently contain complexity: they "suggest,""invite,""encourage,""push," even "propel"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 76] all sorts of readings. Assuredly,
                    <em class="emph">readers</em> are rewarded by attending to Pressman’s close readings, but
                the degree to which we owe this brilliance to the text or to the critic’s ingenuity
                remains an open question.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Pressman’s most controversial definitions cover electronic literature and New
                Criticism. She defines electronic literature through aesthetic and material criteria
                — "born-digital" works that are "computational and processural, dependent upon the operations of the machine for
                    its aesthetic effects"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 1] — an austere characterization that makes no
                reference to the Internet, networks, or multimedia. Pressman restricts her gaze
                further by focusing on digital modernism, a subgenre that rejects mainstream
                electronic literature’s investment in hyperlinks, interactivity, and multimedia. As
                a result, when she deprecates the "small but certain
                    canon"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 6] of first-generation electronic literature, we
                could retort that she simply replaces it with a<em class="emph"> different</em> small but
                certain canon. Still, <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite>’s canon hangs
                together by other means than the rubber stamping of an expert’s approval: digital
                modernism "renovates" and "remixes
                    literary modernism" by being "text based,
                    aesthetically difficult, and ambivalent in [its] relationship to mass media and
                    popular culture"[<a class="ref" href="#pressman2014">Pressman 2014</a>, 2]. Like the earlier modernism it remediates,
                digital modernism "challenges traditional expectations about
                    what art is and does. It illuminates and interrogates the cultural
                    infrastructures, technological networks, and critical practices that support and

                develops another "excavatory" reading in her analysis of <cite class="title italic">Dakota</cite>, but it, too, could be literally about excavation,
                as its South Dakota-to-South Korea setting documents the transformation of a state
                during a twenty-first century gold rush for the minerals on which <cite class="title italic">Dakota</cite>’s Flash iterations depend. Space constraints thus
                leave chinks in <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite>’s erudite armor. The
                last half of Chapter Two, for example, relies on Pressman’s access to a rare text:
                the 1931 collection of poems Bob Brown commissioned from major modernists, including
                Gertrude Stein, Filippo Marinetti, and William Carlos Williams, for Brown’s Readies

                access to human cognition. <cite class="title italic">Digital Modernism</cite> shows that

                Lewis). Can Pressman find no electronic renovations of, say, Virginia Woolf, May
                Sinclair, or Dorothy Richardson to balance the book’s elaborations of Joyce, Pound,

                have been a banal retread. This tonal anomaly, when considered as a performative
