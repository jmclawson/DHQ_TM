				literary form called the “quest” and its relationship to issues of interpretation,
				focusing primarily on game theory with concrete examples as well as some broadly
				applicable pedagogical uses of these ideas in literature classrooms. The argument
				contributes to a recent theoretical and practical discussion of “quests” by scholars
				of games studies such as <a href="#aarseth2004">Aarseth 2004</a>, <a href="#juul2005">Juul 2005</a>, <a href="#tosca2003">Tosca 2003</a>,
				and <a href="#tronstad2001">Tronstad 2001</a>. I build upon and revise these
				theorists’ understandings by approaching a “quest” as a goal-oriented activity in
				which players undertake a journey in search of meaning. By demonstrating
				similarities between the literary traditions in which quests are central and the
				practice of digital game design, I argue that quests can be better understood
				theoretically and more productively used in the classroom if meaning and action are
				regarded as complementary design principles instead of conflicting impulses. A
				revised understanding of quests can help to mediate between games and narratives by
				showing strategies by which game designers have created meaningful action, often in
				ways that are either unconsciously similar to or inspired by the literary traditions
				of mythology, epic, and romance. Specifically, game designers can use level design
				to create labyrinthine spaces that encode thematic implications, in the tradition of
				literary allegory. If these symbolic spaces are coordinated with significant
				obstacles and challenges, the apparent conflict between meaning and action can be
				resolved through engaging gameplay that allows players to enact a range of thematic
				ideas, contributing to the ongoing replay value of a digital game. I also suggest
				ways in which this understanding of quests can allow literature teachers to plan
				assignments where students transform literary narratives into interpretative quests
				taking the form of digital games. As a paradigmatic example, I describe one such
				assignment, in which my students adapted episodes from Pynchon’s <cite class="title italic">The Crying of Lot 49</cite> into design documents and prototypes,
				and I suggest some theoretical implications of its results for other instructors. By
				adapting works of literature into quests, students learn to discover and create
				meaning through the active exertion of cognitive and imaginative effort rather than
				absorbing it passively. </p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Quests: Theoretical Background</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">A quest is both a genre of gaming activity and a structure that operates throughout
				an extended tradition of ancient and modern literary works that have inspired games
				and may also be better understood when taught through the medium of games. While
				there are many more general applications of gaming in literary pedagogy, quests are
				worthy of extended, focused study because the need for general works on game design
				and game pedagogy has already been filled. These pioneering studies include the work
				of Henry Jenkins and the Education Arcade at MIT [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2004">Jenkins 2004</a>], the
				encyclopedic compendium of Salen and Zimmerman’s <cite class="title italic">Rules of Play</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#salen2004">Salen 2004</a>], and James Paul Gee’s foundational academic study of game
				pedagogy in <cite class="title italic">What Video Games Have to Teach Us about Learning
					and Literacy</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#gee2004">Gee 2004</a>]. These works, as well as general works on game design like
				Rollings and Adams’ <cite class="title italic">On Game Design</cite>, tend to explore a
				wide variety of game genres and their applications in many fields of "serious
					gaming", from teaching chemistry concepts and rhetoric to modeling
				business ethics and economics. Yet within these works, there is usually the
				acknowledgment that some related genres of games share a similar form of gameplay
				that emphasizes the unraveling of a mysterious underlying story, the development of
				character through the gradual acquisition of more powerful objects and skills, as
				well as the pursuit of a goal by traveling through a fantastical landscape. Such
				games include both single-player role-playing games and massively multiplayer online
				role-playing games (MMORPGs), as well as adventure and action-adventure games. These
				games are sometimes set apart from other game genres because they contain quests, to
				the point that some games researchers refer to them collectively as "quest
					games". There have been a few foundational articles dealing specifically
				with the issue of quests, including Espen Aarseth’s "Quest Games
					as Post Narrative Discourse"[<a class="ref" href="#aarseth2004">Aarseth 2004</a>] and Susana Tosca’s "The Quest
					Problem in Computer Games"[<a class="ref" href="#tosca2003">Tosca 2003</a>]. Yet there remains much more to be studied in relation to
				this particular type of game and gaming activity; indeed, it may be more productive
				in light of the plethora of high-quality general works on game design to focus on
				particular threads such as the quest that give coherence, focus, and originality to
				new inquiries.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2"> The concept of the quest is useful in both the theory and practice of game design,
				because it offers one way out of the debate between narratologists and ludologists
				and into a more productive focus on issues surrounding the goal-oriented pursuit of
				meaning in both games and literature. As most scholars of new media now know,
				narratologists analyze games as stories, while ludologists insist that games should
				be studied for the features that are distinctively related to play, such as rules
				and simulation. While the definition of both narrative and game are highly contested
				by both camps, these theorists tend to define a narrative as a sequence of events
				that a reader follows in time, while a game is a set of rules for interactive play.
				The debate between narratologists and ludologists occupied much of the first wave of
				game studies, such as the essays in the anthology <cite class="title italic">First Person:
					New Media as Story, Performance, and Game</cite>, but many games researchers
				are now claiming to have moved beyond this conflict. However, what it means to move
				forward differs greatly from party to party. In some cases, this statement amounts
				to an explicit or implied argument that one side won, usually the ludologists, who
				are seen to have attained a victory based upon the increasing acceptance of studying
				games on their own terms rather than through cinematic or literary theories. Other
				key figures in the former ludology/narratology debate, such as Gonzalo Frasca, have
				recently dismissed the debate as unproductive, claiming that it was always founded
				upon the misconception that game theorists were inherently hostile toward stories. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3"> In effect, current debates about the ludology/narratology question often result in
				even fiercer arguments over whether the debate is in fact over, followed by
				meta-debates over who won and how to proceed. Some scholars, such as Elizabeth Losh
				in "Making Things Public: Democracy and Government-Funded
					Virtual Reality Simulations," argue that a second debate has replaced the
				ludology/narratology debate in the form of a clash between critics who analyze the
				merits of persuasive games for achieving political change versus critics who
				critique the role of games in maintaining the current status quo [<a class="ref" href="#losh2006">Losh 2006</a>]. Such an approach shifts emphasis away from games and
				stories, opting for a more politicized methodology akin to the work of New
				Historicists and cultural studies scholars in literature departments. However,
				another move has involved gestures of rapprochement between game and narrative on
				the part of games researchers such as Espen Aarseth and his colleagues Jesper Juul
				and Susana Tosca at the Center for Computer Games Research in Copenhagen. These
				reconciliatory gestures often involve the identification of a mediating term, such
				as "quests", that suggests qualities of both games and narrative
				while exhibiting features that require a distinct theoretical name. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">As Jesper Juul explains in <cite class="title italic">Half-Real: Video Games Between Real
					Rules and Fictional Worlds</cite>, many scholars of video games have written
				about the concept of the quest as one attempt to resolve the ludology versus
				narratology debate [<a class="ref" href="#juul2005">Juul 2005</a>]: <blockquote><p>As an attempt at bridge-building between the open structure
						of games and the closed structure of stories, the concept of quests has been
						proposed by Ragnhild Tronstad (2001), Espen Aarseth (2004b), and Susan Tosca
						(2003). Quests in games can actually provide an interesting type of bridge
						between game rules and game fiction in that the games can contain predefined
						sequences of events that the player then has to actualize or effect.  [<a class="ref" href="#juul2005">Juul 2005</a>, 17]</p></blockquote> Juul concisely defines the difference between a quest and a narrative by
				focusing on the issue of performative activity, which requires the player of a game
				to cause events to occur through effort rather than passively observing as these
				events unfold. Instead of dispensing with the events of narrative altogether, as
				some radical ludologists propose, theorists of the quest suggest that a game can
				contain a strong story without losing its playability if the player must enact its
				events. This concept includes the idea of "interactivity", by which a
				player can change a narrative through her actions, but the quest is not only an
				interactive narrative. Rather than playing in a simulated world where unplanned
				narratives spontaneously emerge out of the rules of the game, a player of a quest
				undertakes a goal-oriented activity that requires her to overcome challenges in
				order to cause a range of possible but specific events to occur.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5"> In other words, the concept of a quest synthesizes games and narratives by
				emphasizing that the events of a narrative will not occur unless a player actively
				overcomes obstacles through the exertion of effort within a rule-based system in
				order to accomplish a task. Aarseth offers the most succinct definition of a quest
				when he writes that "a player-avatar must move through a
					landscape in order to fulfill a goal while mastering a series of challenges.
					This phenomenon is called a quest" (368). Aarseth’s definition highlights
				two important features of the quest: it involves movement through space that is
				directed toward the accomplishment of a task, and it requires the overcoming of
				difficulties in order to reach this goal. However, Aarseth’s definition tends to
				strip the idea of the quest of its content, such as the meaning of the goal or the
				nature of the space traversed. Many games have objectives, spaces, and challenges,
				but not all designers and players tend to use the word "quest" to
				describe all of these games. Indeed, the word "quest" figures most
				prominently in role-playing games and adventure games, from early adventure games
				like King’s Quest to more recent role-playing games like <cite class="title italic">The
					Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</cite> or MMORPGs like <cite class="title italic">Everquest II</cite> and <cite class="title italic">World of Warcraft</cite>. These
				games in fact allude to a long tradition of literature about quests that has been
				theorized by comparative mythologists such as Joseph Campbell and formalist literary
				critics such as Northrop Frye. These figures belong firmly to the narratological
				tradition that ludologists have tended to oppose but that can complement their work
				rather than clashing with it. Viewed in this light, Joseph Campbell’s three-part
				description of the Hero’s Journey is closer to Aarseth’s definition than it might at
				first seem: <blockquote><p>A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a
						region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a
						decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure
						with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.  [<a class="ref" href="#campbell1949">Campbell 1949</a>, 30]</p></blockquote> As in Aarseth, Campbell emphasizes a protagonist’s spatial movement and
				accomplishment of difficult tasks in order to attain goals in the form of the
				ability to share his rewards. Unlike Aarseth, Campbell maps the content of the
				spaces that the hero moves through, characterized by a pattern of "separation" from the world of everyday nature and society,
					"initiation" into a separate, fantastic world, and
					"return" with the fruits of his labor. Technically,
				Campbell’s definition refers to a "journey" rather than a
					"quest" — a distinction that has to do with his interest in
				comparative mythology of many cultures rather than the exclusively Western literary
				tradition of romance. However, the literary critic Northrop Frye argues that "romance" is the genre or "mythos" that both contains the quest and is contained by it in its overall
				structure. Frye writes that "the essential element of plot in romance is adventure,
						which means that romance is naturally a sequential and processional form,
						hence we know it better from fiction than from drama " [<a class="ref" href="#frye1957">Frye 1957</a>, 186]. Adventure is not synonymous with romance but is rather its content, and this
				content takes the form of a sequence. For Frye, the quest is the climactic episode
				in a series of adventures, distinguished from minor events by its size and
				centrality. At the same time, the quest is also the formal principle by which the
				romance is structured, without which it would only be a sequence of adventures. Frye
				concisely summarizes, "We may call this major adventure, the element that gives
						literary form to the romance, the quest" [<a class="ref" href="#frye1957">Frye 1957</a>, 187]. Frye explains, <blockquote><p>The complete form of the romance is clearly the successful
						quest, and such a completed form has three main stages: the stage of the
						perilous journey and the preliminary minor adventures; the crucial struggle,
						usually some kind of battle in which either the hero or his foe, or both,
						must die; and the exaltation of the hero. [<a class="ref" href="#campbell1949">Campbell 1949</a>, 30]</p></blockquote> Frye’s structure, like Campbell’s, has three parts, but Frye collapses the
				second of Campbell’s stages ("initiation") into the first
				stage of his schema. Frye also ends the quest at the conclusion of Campbell’s second
				stage, directly after what Campbell would call the hero’s greatest battle or "ordeal" and his subsequent "apotheosis" or elevation to divinity.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6"> Because of the relationship of Aarseth’s and Tosca’s definitions of the quest to an
				extended ancient and modern literary tradition, this gaming activity has wide
				research and pedagogical implications. Susana Tosca observes the relevance of the
				genres of epic and romance as well as Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey to the "background" of quest games though she brackets the question
				of how closely the literary and gaming traditions can be related, arguing primarily
				that such theories are "not pointless" to the study of
				games [<a class="ref" href="#tosca2003">Tosca 2003</a>, 4.1]. Tosca’s claim is insightful but deserves
				further development, since a more detailed and forceful statement of the
				relationship between the literary tradition of quests and their operation as a
				gaming activity would allow the quest concept to fulfill its bridge-building
				function more effectively. Stronger connections between the literary history of
				quest narratives and quest games can also offer strategies for how to teach a rich
				tradition of literature through technologies associated with a more recent but
				equally valuable selection of games, from early adventure games of the 1980’s to
				next-generation RPG’s. I have given an assignment in which I taught Thomas Pynchon’s
					<cite class="title italic">The Crying of Lot 49</cite> by having students design
				quests, and there is vast lineage of narratives about quests that includes a variety
				of genres and periods. This includes ancient epics like <cite class="title italic">The
					Odyssey</cite>, medieval romances like <cite class="title italic">Parzival</cite> or
					<cite class="title italic">The Quest for the Holy Grail</cite>, Renaissance allegory,
				nineteenth century novels patterned on the romance such as Jane Eyre, modern
				detective stories, and some postmodern narratives. This lineage of literature is
				indeed only a selection of possible works, but it is a rich, broad selection that is
				relevant to almost anyone in the humanities with an interest in canonical
				literature. It is certainly the case that some works of literature would be better
				taught through the analytical lens of the quest than others. For example, Charlotte
				Brontë’s <cite class="title italic">Jane Eyre</cite> would be productively understood as
				a protagonist’s voyage toward a meaningful goal across the obstacle-ridden, symbolic
				landscape of Thrushcross Grange, while the complex negotiations of power relations
				and parlor-room social maneuvering of <cite class="title italic">Pride and
				Prejudice</cite> might be better taught through a simulation game like <cite class="title italic">The Sims</cite>. Nevertheless, there is an important feature of
				literary study in general that can be better understood through the paradigm of the
				quest than in any other game type: the pursuit of meaning as an active cognitive and
				imaginative enterprise rather than passive consumption, aimless social interaction,
				or uncommitted exploration of indeterminacy. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7"> The critical studies of the "quest" are increasingly becoming more
				than just a middle ground between game and narrative, focusing on the relationship
				between meaning and action, and revolving around the issue of significant gameplay.
				Theoretical and pedagogical understandings of the quest will increase if we focus
				further on the issue of meaning in quests, extending the idea of meaning beyond
				semiotic indications of function to thematic implications. For Tronstad, "to do a quest is to search for the meaning of it" [<a class="ref" href="#tronstad2001">Tronstad 2001</a>, 4.1]. However, Tronstad’s use of "meaning" is primarily
				functional rather than thematic in that it is concerned with signs as indicators of
				a game object’s function rather than the ideas associated with it. Hence, she argues
				that when a player finds a new object, she must "decode its significance in relation to the quest, to come
						closer to the quest’s solution" [<a class="ref" href="#tronstad2001">Tronstad 2001</a>, 4.1]. In other words, if a player discovers a key, the "meaning" of this key is that there will be something for it to open,
				such as a chest. If the player then discovers a sword in the chest upon opening it,
				this sword might have the "meaning" that a dragon must be
				fought and slain. This concept of meaning ignores the possibility of deeper thematic
				significance, in which the player must enact not only events, but also ideas and
				insights. Tronstad does argue that the motivation for the quest is the "promise" of meaning, but she also argues that quests must
				withhold this meaning if they are to keep their status as quests. She explains that
				quests are "promising their solution, promising
					<em class="emph">meaning</em>. But as meaning is also the death of the quest, it is
					frequently breaking this promise, in order to prolong the questing
				experience" (3). By setting up a false binary between meaning and action,
				Tronstad overlooks the idea that players can enact meaning if the elements of the
				quest have thematic implications that are revealed through play. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8"> Because Tronstad’s focus on meaning is strictly functional, she views the movement
				from quest to narrative as uni-directional and unrepeatable. Thus, she argues that <blockquote><p>the paradox of questing is that as soon as meaning is
						reached, the quest stops functioning as <em class="emph">quest</em>. When meaning is
						found, the quest is <em class="emph">history</em>. It cannot be done again, as it is
						simply not the same experience to solve a puzzle quest for the second time.  [<a class="ref" href="#tronstad2001">Tronstad 2001</a>, 4.1]</p></blockquote> This analysis is only true if meaning is conceived of in the utilitarian
				manner that Tronstad suggests. It is true that once a player has determined what
				chest a key unlocks, the meaning of the key ceases to be interesting in subsequent
				playing sessions. However, if the key has greater, multivalent allegorical and
				symbolic connotations, then these might be productively and enjoyably enacted
				multiple times by different players, as they deepen their understanding of this
				meaning or seek a different interpretation. The performance of the quest multiple
				times would result in the production of different or more richly developed
				constatives. Conversely, the constatives of literary narratives can be transformed
				into quests, which has the advantage both of making literature interactive and of
				bringing deeper symbolic meaning to the actions of the quest. Tosca raises the
				possibility of literary narratives inspiring quests but temporarily brackets the
				issue, noting that "this is more a question of adaptation from one medium to
						another, and as such is beyond the limits of this paper" [<a class="ref" href="#tosca2003">Tosca 2003</a>, 4.1]. At the same time, she does raise a series of interesting questions about to
				what extent such an adaptation would re-create the book’s "story-world," its events, or be a "thematic
					adaptation" of the work. The "thematic
				adaptation" possibility highlights the importance of meaning in quests, the
				feature that Tosca explores least in her criticisms of existing quests and her
				suggestions for new ones. Tosca’s students criticized many existing quests in games
				for being "too linear, boring, repetitive, and unrelated to the
						character’s 'physical' and emotional development." [<a class="ref" href="#tosca2003">Tosca 2003</a>, 1] In response to these critiques, they created quests that were non-linear,
				emotionally involving, and had surprising plot twists. While these are positive
				pedagogical accomplishments, a key aspect of interesting quests is not just emotion
				or surprise but rather meaning, something that Tosca acknowledges but does not
				expand upon in her statement that "the quest or mission format allows for a contextualization
						of the game’s actions in a more or less meaningful story" (<a href="#tosca2003">Tosca 2003, abstract</a>). This raises the question of how to make quests more meaningful rather than
				less, and also of how to analyze the ways in which both designers and players create
				and enact meaning. Because critics often already treat spaces and objects in works
				of literature as having dense potential meaning, quests based on these narratives
				can inherit these meanings or complicate and challenge them. Designing a quest based
				on a work of literature is itself an act of interpretation by which the designer
				considers how a player will enact a meaning or range of possible meanings available
				in a text.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9"> Because meaning is a highly difficult and complex concept, it deserves further
				theorization in order to function effectively both in the theory and practice of
				games generally and of quest games more specifically. Tronstad’s emphasis on the
				promise of meaning as the motivation of a quest is the beginning of such a movement,
				but she and Aarseth tend to see meaning and action as conflicting principles.
				Aarseth puts this conflict in the most extreme terms in his declaration that the
				quest games with most replay value are those that have no meaning at all. In order
				to better understand the operation of quests and their pedagogical function within
				literature classrooms — whose goal is often the interpretation of meaning — it would
				be productive to regard meaning and action not as opposed elements of quests but as
				complementary components that can be synthesized in meaningful action. Moreover,
				such a claim is borne out by close study of the games whose designers and players
				focus most overtly on quests as a gaming activity, such as contemporary role-playing
				games. Game designers, teachers, and students can better understand how to create a
				context in which meaning can emerge in quests by studying two aspects of this gaming
				activity and literary structure: its spaces and challenges, with particular emphasis
				on the objects sought out by players and questing heroes. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Spaces of the Quest</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10"> Quests gain much of their interest and meaning from the player’s movement through
				simulated space, which acquires meaning as the environment upon which and within
				which the player must act. Jenkins offers a useful context for the role of space in
				quests in his article "Game Design as Narrative
				Architecture," where he argues that game designers do not create linear
				narratives but rather spaces that contain either "embedded" narratives suggested by the arrangement of space or "enacted" narratives that the player may perform in various
				orders [<a class="ref" href="#jenkins2004">Jenkins 2004</a>, 124–8]. A quest is more structured than
				what Henry Jenkins calls "emergent narrative" and more
				focused on the overcoming of challenge than Jenkins’ "enacted
					narrative." An emergent narrative is a sequence of events that develops
				spontaneously out of a player’s rule-based interactions with a simulated world, such
				as <cite class="title italic">The Sims</cite>. Once the player has performed a series of
				events within a playing session or series of sessions in such a game, she could
				recount them in the past tense and describe their relationship to each other or
				emotional significance to her. An "enacted narrative" is
				a game structure that allows a player to perform an event in a story that she is
				already familiar with as a spectator, such as Jenkins’s example of picking up a
				lightsaber and defeating Darth Maul in a game adaptation of <cite class="title italic">Star Wars: Episode I</cite>. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11"> A quest is more structured than an emergent narrative because it has a predefined
				structure of events that will occur if the player succeeds, but it requires more
				effort from a player than an enacted narrative because these events will not occur
				unless the player overcomes certain challenges. Moreover, in a quest a player is not
				only bringing a story to fulfillment but is also enacting a set of thematic ideas
				and implications associated with the events of this story and experienced on the
				level of gameplay. The word "quest" implies the search for a valuable
				goal, a goal with significance to the player or to her virtual identity as avatar
				within a simulated world. One would not probably not speak of a
				"quest" to take out the trash in <cite class="title italic">The
				Sims</cite> or to gobble all of the white dots in <cite class="title italic">Pac-Man</cite>, except ironically. However, both designers and players have long
				referred to goals with special significance in the gameworld as
				"quests", such as Sir Graham’s search in <cite class="title italic">King’s
					Quest I</cite> for the three magical treasures that will save the Kingdom of
				Daventry, or the player’s attempt to close the gateway to the hellish plane of
				Oblivion in <cite class="title italic">The Elder Scrolls IV</cite>. Even the "side
					quests" of role-playing games, which are distinguished from a
					"main quest" by their lack of an epic underlying storyline, have
				significance to the player in terms of either the acquisition of greater skills for
				her virtual identity or the benefit of her guild. Because quests are associated with
				significant objectives, it is also possible for them to convey thematic meaning in
				the form of allegory and symbolism that operates not only through the
				representational strategies of the game but also through the actions that each
				player performs within space.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12"> Indeed, the spaces through which players move as they overcome challenges and
				fulfill the goals of quests can themselves encode meaning through the time-tested
				strategies of spatial allegory that have operated in quest narratives (and literary
				allegories more generally) since <cite class="title italic">The Quest of the Holy
				Grail</cite> and <cite class="title italic">The Faerie Queene</cite>. In <cite class="title italic">Mapping the Faerie Queene: Quest Structures and the World of the
					Poem</cite>, Erickson argues that the vertical and horizontal spatial
				configuration of Spenser’s fictional cosmos conveys much of the thematic
				implications of the virtues embodied by the knights and their nation-building or
				ethical quests [<a class="ref" href="#erickson1996">Erickson 1996</a>]. This scheme of meaningful landscapes
					"remediates" allegory, to use Bolter and Grusin’s
				terms for the reworking of one medium in terms of another. Bolter and Grusin observe
				that in digital art "naïve allegory is common, as we see, for
					example, in the computer game Myst with its allegory of the end of the book"[<a class="ref" href="#bolter1999">Bolter and Grusin 1999</a>, 136]. By "naïve
				allegory," they refer to art with an "obvious
				message," presumably to be contrasted with heavily ironized, ambivalent
				allegory, such as that theorized by Paul de Man. They regard the "losing" endings of the computer game <cite class="title italic">Myst</cite>, in which the player is entrapped within imprisoning books instead
				of being able to move freely through the space of computer graphics, as an
				allegorical critique of the book at the same time that the game remediates the book
				through its interface and plot.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13"> However, the tradition of creating meaningful spaces originates in literary
				allegories that are far from naïve, and which encourage a degree of engagement that
				prefigures digital games. As Erickson argues, the starting and ending points of the
				knights’ quests in Spenser’s poems themselves convey meaning. These quests begin in
				historical sixth-century Britain and then proceed into Faeryland, thereby conjoining
				the historical and political concerns of epic poetry with the private, fantastic
				themes of chivalric romance. Moreover, Erickson points out that Gordon Teskey’s
				recent theories of Spenserian allegory emphasize a "game of
						'interpretative play'," in which readers learn not
				just by example but "by becoming engaged, through the play of
					interpretation, in the theory of virtue." While Erickson and Teskey are
				not discussing New Media, the combination of Erickson’s focus on the imaginative
				spaces of the poem and Teskey’s interest in its elicitation of readers’ active
				involvement suggests that Spenser was already striving for the synthesis of "immersion and interactivity" that Marie-Laure Ryan upholds
				as the ideal of digital art [<a class="ref" href="#ryan2001">Ryan 2001</a>]. Aarseth’s evocative phrase
				for video game representations of space, "allegories of
				space," turns out to have another dimension besides the one that he focuses
				on [<a class="ref" href="#aarseth2000">Aarseth 2000</a>]. Aarseth argues that the spaces of digital games can
				only be "allegories" of space because they consist of
				digital implementations of automated rules necessary to create a game rather than
				actual physical or social laws. As he puts it, <blockquote><p>[i]n other words, the topology of even the most ‘open’
						computer generated landscapes makes them quite different from real space,
						and controlled in ways that are not inherent in the original physical
						objects they are meant to represent. This makes them allegorical: they are
						figurative comments on the ultimate impossibility of representing real
						space.  [<a class="ref" href="#aarseth2000">Aarseth 2000</a>, 169]</p></blockquote> While the unbridgeable gap between representation and an unattainable
				objective reality has been well explored in De Man’s theories of allegory, the
				spaces of quests are also "figurative comments" on a wide
				variety of actions and ideas other than the self-reflexive problems of representing
				space, such as the goals of the player and their relationship to a larger simulated
				world. For example, in the classic role-playing game, <cite class="title italic">Ultima
					IV: The Quest of the Avatar</cite>, designer Richard Garriott deliberately sets
				up an intricate system of correspondences between a set of moral virtues and the
				representational features of the game’s simulated world, including its colors,
				villages, and directions of the compass. As players battle monsters, seek out hidden
				shrines, and search for magical artifacts in each of the game’s sub-quests, they are
				acting out the game’s allegorical meanings (or failing to act them out), in such a
				way that gameplay gradually reveals these correspondences, and successful completion
				of the quests necessitates an understanding of them. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14"> Following both Spenser’s literary allegories and Garriott’s allegorical games, the
				environment of the maze is a key spatial principle whose organization can
				instantiate multiple interpretative paths as well as the search for a significant
				object through the active descent into a treacherous environment. Quests in games
				and literature often take place in mazes, which proliferate in the "descents
					into the underworld" of myth and the "dungeon crawls" of
				role-playing games. However, as Natkin argues in his analysis of level design, the
				coordination of the maze model with other gameplay elements is crucial to create
				immersive gameplay [<a class="ref" href="#natkin2006">Natkin 2006</a>]. Distributed through this maze must
				be spatial obstacles to be overcome, such as locked doors and chasms, as well as
				objects and scripted events that specify the rules for overcoming these challenges
				and rewards for doing so. Indeed, Natkin draws much of his analysis of level design
				from Guardiola, who suggests that "a level is made up of a
					collection of quests," reinforcing the idea that contemporary game design
				is increasingly leaning toward a quest-based understanding of game space [<a class="ref" href="#natkin2006">Natkin 2006</a>]. Without obstacles and rewards combined through logical
				event scripting, a level runs the risk of becoming aimless wandering, which in
				interpretative terms equates to a navigation of many possible meanings without ever
				arguing for their relative merits or analyzing them in depth. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Challenges of the Quest</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15"> In order to progress through the spaces of quests, the player must overcome trials,
				and quests can thus be classified in part by the challenges that they provide and
				the initiations that result from overcoming these obstacles. A typology of quests
				would also include features such as the player’s objective, the actions that he must
				undertake, and the quest’s location. To construct a "typology" and "grammar" of these quests like that
				proposed by Aarseth, one would also need to examine the ways in which plot-lines
				inspired by literary genres give rise to quests or develop out of them. Although
				quests are not synonymous with narratives, story-lines offer an important motivation
				for undertaking quests as well as a reward for completing them. Taking into account
				features of both action and narrative, online communities of players have developed
				semi-formal classifications for quests, which have been further formalized in
				official "strategy guides". These schemes can be strengthened through
				close analysis of quests in games with a great variety of quests, like <cite class="title italic">World of Warcraft</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Oblivion</cite>. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16"> In-game text and gaming communities tend to classify quests as "fetch
				quests", "delivery quests", "dungeon crawls",
					"escort quests", and "kill quests", a typology
				that is reinforced by R.V. Kelly’s similar list of quest types in <cite class="title italic">Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing games</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#kelly2004">Kelly 2004</a>]. These categories can be further divided into
				sub-categories, combined with each other, and melded with narrative back stories to
				produce a wide variety of possible quests. In a "fetch quest", a
				character must find a valuable, often magical object and return it to a non-player
				character (NPC) for a reward. While the term "fetch quest" is often
				used critically by gamers because this device has become ubiquitous and sometimes
				seems clichéd, the original "quest for the holy grail" is itself a
					"fetch quest". Indeed, the etymological origins of quest in
					"questare" (Latin: to seek) implies that the search for something
				absent or hidden is fundamental to questing. Vladimir Propp argued that this motif
				was the distinguishing feature of quests, which allowed them to take a central role
				in the morphology of folktales [<a class="ref" href="#propp1968">Propp 1968</a>]. Despite the familiarity
				of the form, the interest of such a quest depends upon the value and meaning of the
				object sought as well as the challenges that must be surmounted to reach it. Items
				necessary for the completion of a quest are often set aside in a player’s inventory
				as "quest items", which cannot be destroyed or discarded because
				doing so would bring the plot to a stand-still. Such artifacts are distinguished
				from the proliferation of objects in the game that have strictly utilitarian or
				ornamental functions, such as ordinary weapons, tapestries, and furniture. Unlike
				these items, quest items are either unique (like the Holy Grail) or a component of a
				larger item, like the seven pieces of a magical staff or the three portions of the
				Triforce in the <cite class="title italic">Legend of Zelda</cite> games. These objects
				are invested with significance as objects playing a key role in unfolding
				storylines, like the "McGuffins" of film but with an interactivity
				that comes from the player’s ability to use them to cause a narrative to progress.
				They often also accrue personal, political, and even cosmic meaning as
				instantiations of the battling demonic and divine forces seeking to control the
				simulated world of the game. For example, in <cite class="title italic">The Elder Scrolls
					IV: Oblivion</cite>, the four middle quests in the main quest-line involve
				finding Azura’s star, the armor of Tiber Septim, a great Welkynd stone, and a great
				Sigil stone for the emperor’s heir. Fetch quests in <cite class="title italic">Oblivion</cite> range from mundane but sometimes charming "collection
					quests", such as looking for twelve scales from a rare breed of
				Slaughterfish, to cosmic, such as the search for a Great Sigil Stone. The slain
				emperor’s heir uses this stone to close one gate to hell and open a doorway to the
					"paradise" where the final battle between good and evil takes
				place. A frequent variant on the "fetch quest" could be referred to
				as the "delivery quest" (less formally known as the "fedex
					quest"), in which a player must carry an item from one character to
				another. "Kill quests" or "assassination quests"
				require the player to slay monsters or hostile NPC’s, either as an end in itself
				that remedies an injustice or as a means to an end, since the gaining of an item in
				a fetch quest often requires the defeat of many enemies. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17"> Kill quests involve extensive combat with monsters, resulting in the intense
				violence that many opponents of video games decry. But they also allow a context in
				which players can confront, reflect upon, and in some cases refrain from battles
				with the forces regarded as "Evil" or "Other" by a
				given society. This violence is no more intense, detailed, or gratuitous than that
				practiced by Odysseus as he engages in his "kill quest" to slay the
				Cyclops or the suitors. Looking back over a long history of quest narratives, scenes
				in works of literature now considered "classic" revolve around brutal
				violence that equals or outstrips the <cite class="title italic">Grand Theft Auto</cite>
				series. Combat pervades chivalric romance, since large parts of the action in these
				narratives involve ritualized jousting and swordplay between knights, not to mention
				the slaying of roving beasts and dragons. Indeed, Frye saw
				"dragon-killing" as the central, defining motif of quests in romances
				(189). Digital games simply put the responsibility for this violence on the player,
				who must acquire the dexterity and persistence necessary to destroy her enemies and
				may (in the case of games like <cite class="title italic">Fable</cite> or <cite class="title italic">Oblivion</cite>) determine the role of violence in the
				development of her player-character and the game’s simulated world. As with all
				quests, the purpose and meaning of the violence determines the consequences of the
				player’s actions. It is equally possible in Oblivion to murder random citizens or to
				destroy a demonic lord, but one action will put the player’s avatar in jail while
				the other will result in a quest reward. Video games are often criticized for their
				violence, yet combat constitutes one of the key trials by which the meaningful
				conflicts of quest narratives are manifested, as well as one of the most fruitful
				opportunities for the conversion of narrative into action. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18"> Similar opportunities for meaningful action can emerge from an "escort
				quest", in which the player must guide an NPC from one location to another
				while protecting this character from enemies. In Oblivion, one early such quest
				involves bringing the slain emperor’s heir, Martin Septim, from the besieged town of
				Kvatch to a refuge in Weynon Prior. Participation in such a quest results in an
				emotional investment toward the charge that the player protects, resulting at first
				involuntarily from the need to shield the non-player character in order to progress
				in the game. Yet, such a quest can have larger implications concerning the degree of
				one’s complicity with a prevailing political regime in a game (for example, the
				opportunity to respect or abandon the Emperor in the opening quest of <cite class="title italic">Oblivion</cite>), or the strength of a personal connection, such
				as the potentially poignant or tragic escort quest of Hero’s mother in <cite class="title italic">Fable</cite>. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19"> Thematic implications can occur with even greater subtlety in quests involving
				puzzles, which refer to any cognitive problem that must be solved in order to
				progress further in the game. Puzzles often take the form of navigating mazes,
				unlocking secret doors, answering riddles, deciphering codes, and finding and using
				unfamiliar objects or "treasures". Puzzles most commonly appear in
				certain genres, such as adventure games or designated "puzzle games",
				but Juul argues that the challenges exemplified in puzzles are characteristic of
				games in general [<a class="ref" href="#juul2005">Juul 2005</a>]. A well-designed puzzle has both thematic
				and cognitive aspects, since it requires designers and players to enact themes from
				the work at the same time that they solve an informational or mechanical problem. In
					<cite class="title italic">Twisty Little Passages</cite>, Montfort offers an
				excellent example of how players may enact themes in games. In his analysis of
				Andrew Plotkin’s experimental interactive fiction <cite class="title italic">So
				Far</cite>, Montfort argues, "the workings of the IF world and
					the themes of <cite class="title italic">So Far</cite> must be enacted [. . .] for
					the interactor to make progress"[<a class="ref" href="#montfort2003">Montfort 2003</a>, 210]. Montfort is discussing a text-based game in
				which the solutions of puzzles require the player to both uncover and act out a
				theme of relationships that are "so close to but so far
				from" perfection by moving various items (like the two posts of a gate or two
				radioactive bricks) into proximity without allowing them to touch. Montfort’s
				example is representative of a larger tradition of games that conjoin meaning and
				action in gameplay rather than putting them in conflict, including both early
				role-playing games like <cite class="title italic">Ultima IV</cite>, more recent ones
				like <cite class="title italic">The Elder Scrolls</cite>, and experimental
				action-adventure games like <cite class="title italic">The Indigo Prophecy</cite>. Rather
				than having to "break" the promise of meaning in order to maintain
				the interest of the quest, these games have replay value precisely because
				fulfillment of their challenges allows players to contemplate nuances of thematic
				implication through their active effort rather than through passive spectatorship.
				In such a game, the distance between Aarseth’s "interpretative" and "configurative" functions
				diminishes, as does the difference between Zimmerman’s "cognitive interactivity" involved in processing narratives (which he
				associates with readers' "interpretative participation with a
					text") and the "explicit interactivity" of
				designed choices (which he associates with games) [<a class="ref" href="#zimmerman2004">Zimmerman 2004</a>, 158]; [<a class="ref" href="#aarseth1997">Aarseth 1997</a>, 64–65].</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Pedagogical Implications of Interpretative Quests</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">By deliberately merging the interpretative and gameplay function performed by
				players, game design can be taught as a form of interpretative writing within
				literature classrooms. Such an assignment could involve transforming virtually any

				selection running from ancient epic to postmodern quest narrative would be
				particularly amenable to this form of adaptation. I have given one such assignment
				to my sophomore English literature class in which I asked students to adapt Thomas

				quest. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">The assignment to design an interpretative quest has two components: a six page
				written paper combining features of a game design document and a traditional
				interpretative essay, as well as a small multimedia prototype of one part of the
				game. The practice of constructing design documents is familiar to practitioners of
				contemporary game design, as explained in books such as <cite class="title italic">Andrew
					Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#rollings2003">Rollings 2003</a>]. A design document is a verbal and graphical
				presentation of the core elements of a game, such as its gameplay, levels, and
				narrative. In the game industry, such a document is usually prepared as a
				presentation to be given to potential investors, since commercial games often
				require millions of dollars, vast teams of designers with diverse skills, and years
				of planning, execution, and marketing. Hence, game designers need presentations to
				show others that their designs are sound as well as to keep the team focused on an
				overall plan.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22"> The design document in an English class differs from one made for the game industry
				in that it focuses more explicitly on meaning. However, the influential game design
				theorists Salen and Zimmerman do see meaning as a high priority in game design, and
				in documentation more generally, as when they write that "meaning, play and games are intimately related concepts. The goal of successful
					game design is <span class="hi bold">meaningful play</span>"[<a class="ref" href="#salen2004">Salen 2004</a>, 37]. Indeed, they define design in terms of "the creation of meaningful experience," explaining that
					"<span class="hi bold">design</span> is the process by which a <span class="hi bold">designer</span> creates a <span class="hi bold">context</span> to be
					encountered by a <span class="hi bold">participant</span>, from which meaning emerges"[<a class="ref" href="#salen2004">Salen 2004</a>, 37]. Students create a context in which meaning can
				emerge by designing the aspects of a game that correspond to the most theoretically
				distinctive features of quests, including the spaces, challenges, and objects. The
				design document should contain descriptions and analyses of these elements,
				including textual and contextual evidence explaining what they mean as well as
				reflection on how the students’ own interpretative perspective helps to create this
				meaning.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23"> Because of the role of space in shaping quests, adaptations of literary texts work
				best when the designer does not reproduce the events of the narrative in a strictly
				linear fashion, but instead re-creates spaces in which players can bring about some
				of these events and their meanings. Building on a fictional world already created by
				an author, the student translates these geographic features into a world of ideas
				that can be explored by players. This requires interpretative decisions, since a
				location like the surrealist painting of Remedios Varo’s tower described in <cite class="title italic">The Crying of Lot 49</cite> could be read as an emblem of
				Oedipa’s inescapable solipsism, as a foreshadowing of her escape through the use of
				imagination, or as a range of intermediate possibilities. Many of the most
				successful essays based their game concepts around spaces represented in Varo’s art,
				since Pynchon prominently alludes to her painting "Embroidering
					Earth’s Mantle" as a recurrent, ekphrastic metaphor in the novel. This
				topic helped to generate game ideas because Varo’s painting represents a dreamlike
				space conducive to a quest plot: a tower in which a group of captive girls weaves a
				tapestry that, paradoxically, contains the world. Moreover, the sequence of three
				paintings in the "triptych" that Pynchon alludes to
				suggests the structure of a journey in three stages (approaching the dreamlike
				world, imprisonment, and escape), which provides the potential outline for a quest. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24"> Students produced three different analytical approaches to the thematic significance
				of these paintings and three different ways of enacting these interpretations in
				gameplay, all of them taking place within the metaphorical "space" of
				Varo’s paintings. One student argued that the paintings suggest the mind’s ability
				to escape the confines of socially constructed reality through the higher reality of
				the imagination — the etymological meaning of the "sur-real" as
				practiced by Varo. A second student used the space of the Varo painting as the
				setting for a different game that takes the opposite interpretative stance, in which
				the weaving of the tapestry reflects Oedipa’s solipsistic entrapment within a
				reality entirely created by her own mind. A third student synthesized these two
				interpretations, suggesting that her game design will reward players who remain open
				to both surrealistic and solipsistic views of the space of the Varo painting. In a
				highly nuanced thesis statement, this student writes, <blockquote><p>if Oedipa could easily choose a side, she would then cease
						to touch the "real world" that she so longs to find —
						creating the paradox that as long as Oedipa looks for
						"reality", or <span class="hi italic">life</span>, she lives in it;
						but as soon as she assumes she has found it, it ceases to exist for her.  [<a class="ref" href="#neugebauer2006">Neugebauer 2006</a>]</p></blockquote> Neugebauer’s thesis suggests one way in which visualizing <cite class="title italic">The Crying of Lot 49</cite> spatially allowed a student to
				develop stylistically nuanced and argumentatively self-conscious writing that was
				flexibly open to the idea of interpretative indeterminacy. Other teachers could
				benefit from this result by allowing students to design spaces that map the world of
				ideas onto simulated geographical space, including imagined and artistic spaces
				within the work of literature, such as Jane Eyre’s ambiguously emblematic paintings
				or Achilles’ encyclopedically engraved shield in <cite class="title italic">The
				Iliad</cite>. Encouraging students to design these conceptual spaces as well as
					"actual" or "realistic" locations within literary
				narratives could also help accommodate literature from a variety of periods to the
				constraints of role-playing toolsets, which often feature fantastic medieval
				landscapes that lend themselves to allegory. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25"> Despite the richly multivalent signifying potential of spatial allegories, students
				who are adapting literary works into interpretative quests need to be reminded that
				an awareness of labyrinthine indeterminacy should not become an excuse for an utter
				lack of interpretative commitment. In other words, students should design their
				spaces to balance openness and rule-based constraint, one of the recurrent features
				of level design advocated by Natkin. One example of the rationale for this
				pedagogical principle appears in students’ readings of the end of <cite class="title italic">The Crying of Lot 49</cite>, in which Oedipa confronts four
					"symmetrical" choices about the secret society she has been
				pursuing: it is real, it is a hallucination, it is a hoax, or it is the
				hallucination of a hoax [<a class="ref" href="#pynchon1964">Pynchon 1964</a>, 171]. These choices
				resemble the paths through a labyrinth, each of which gives rise to further choices
				and multiple, disorienting endings. Thinking of <cite class="title italic">The Crying of
					Lot 49</cite> as the basis for an adventure or role-playing game, in which
				players often explore labyrinths, led several students to embrace this indeterminacy
				as an opportunity for the exploration of multiple meanings rather than frustration.
				However, students sometimes tended to come to rest complacently in this image, or to
				assert it dogmatically, often as a criticism of scholars who had developed
				well-supported arguments about a particular interpretation. While these students
				were well-intentioned, they sometimes seemed to use the image of the labyrinth as an
				excuse to avoid crafting their own thesis, as when one student wrote that "Through creating this game, I realize that the entire book, <cite class="title italic">The Crying of Lot 49</cite>, was just a labyrinth itself!"[<a class="ref" href="#alonzo2006">Alonzo 2006</a>]. Alonzo’s phrase "just a
				labyrinth" suggests that she is satisfied with multiple interpretative paths
				rather than a single interpretation. Yet, her suggestion that "the entire" book can be understood in this way is itself a totalizing
				argument that contradicts her other idea: that multiple readers can take different
				paths through the text. Such a view sometimes resulted in a lack of interpretative
				focus, as students celebrated different readers’ abilities to choose a path through
				the space of the quest without themselves committing to such a path. This tendency
				in some student essays serves as a reminder that simulated space is only one part of
				a well-designed quest, which must also pose goal-oriented and rule-based challenges
				to the player in order to produce an immersive game and allow the enactment of
				meaning. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Prototypes</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Based on their design documents, the students built prototypes that combined aspects
				of their individual designs to form playable games through which players would enact
				the students’ interpretations of a portion of the novel. Students worked in four
				in-class game workshops and were instructed to meet two to three times out of class.
				The initial workshops were devoted primarily to planning and note-taking regarding
				the game concepts, while later workshops involved working with computers in the
				classroom to make the games. There were four group projects in my class that used
				three different major software applications and a mixture of other programs.
				Students produced two small but functional role-playing quests made with the Aurora
				Toolset, an application that comes with the role-playing game Neverwinter Nights and
				allows designers to make three-dimensional worlds. This toolset is a
				"modding" engine with which users create their own
				"modules" to share with other players. At the same time, it is a
				high-powered, sophisticated tool that can be used in the game design industry, since
				Jeannie Novak in <cite class="title italic">Game Development Essentials</cite> also
				recommends it for prototyping commercial games [<a class="ref" href="#novak2005">Novak 2005</a>]. While the
				toolset is complex, it can be used to make three-dimensional environments without
				either rendering these graphics in Maya or 3D Studio Max or programming them in
				OpenGL or DirectX. Through mastering the menus and buttons of such a toolset as well
				as a system of dragging and dropping objects, both instructors and students can
				construct an explorable environment in a relatively short amount of time. A third
				group produced a web-based Alternate Reality Game made with Dreamweaver, Photoshop,
				and digital cameras. Another produced one part of a puzzle game in Macromedia Flash.
				This was the least successful project because Flash is the most difficult of the
				programs to master, which meant that large amounts of student work translated into a
				rough final product. If I had the opportunity to do this assignment again, I might
				exclusively use the Aurora Toolset because it yields visibly exciting end results
				that encourage students and because its "Plot Wizard" and journal
				system is built entirely around the idea of quests. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">One group’s prototype, called <cite class="title italic">Oedipa’s Quest</cite>, centered
				around the "dreaming children" episode in <cite class="title italic">The Crying of Lot 49</cite>, in which Oedipa encounters a group
				of children warming themselves at an "imaginary fire,"
				who tell her that they are "dreaming the gathering"[<a class="ref" href="#pynchon1964">Pynchon 1964</a>, 118]. After they do not answer her questions
				satisfactorily, Oedipa "to retaliate" stops "believing in them"[<a class="ref" href="#pynchon1964">Pynchon 1964</a>, 119]. To allow players to act out this scene, the
				students used the Aurora toolset to build a small city with a town square. In this
				square, they constructed a circle of runes to represent the "hieroglyphic" posthorns that the children have scrawled on the ground,
				along with an "imaginary fire" made of magical sparks.
				Around this fire they placed children and then scripted conversations for them,
				creating dialogue trees with multiple forking paths of possible interaction with the
				children. The students also gave the children "invisibility
					spells" so that they would disappear when attacked, thereby representing
				Oedipa’s refusal to believe in them. After this encounter, players could enter a
				tower that the students also built in order to represent the environment of Remedios
				Varo’s "Embroidering Earth’s Mantle" painting. The
				students furnished this space with mysterious and arcane accoutrements, and then
				they placed an old man in the tower to represent Genghis Cohen, the stamp collector
				who Oedipa encounters just before she sits down to await "the
					crying of lot 49" and the book’s indeterminate ending in the auction
				room. Again using dialogue trees, the group scripted a conversation in which Cohen
				asks Oedipa to interpret her encounter with the children and gives her three
				possible answers: "solipsism,""surrealism," and "there is no
					answer. The point is to keep searching for the truth." The first two
				answers result in a rebuke from Cohen because of the player’s excessive certainty in
				the face of ambiguity, while the third response earns the player praise and
				encouragement to continue gaining knowledge by exploring further. Students were
				pleased with this final product, but they sometimes showed frustration when the
				toolset could not accommodate aspects of their design document, such as allowing
				players to fill in blanks rather than select multiple choice answers in
				conversation. In future classes, an introduction to the capabilities of the toolset
				before writing the document would help to circumvent these disappointments.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28"> A second group used the Aurora toolset to create the most extensive and functional
				prototype of the class, the humorously titled <cite class="title italic">Polar
					Inverarity’s Overtly Symbolic Quest</cite>. This prototype was highly creative
				and could actually be played as a game, in part because the students made excellent
				use of the Aurora toolset’s "plot wizard" to create quest objectives
				without having to master a scripting language. This group built their project around
				a series of "fetch quests", in which players retrieve an item and
				bring it to another non-player character for a reward or to advance further in the
				game. Players of this group’s game had to acquire a key from Pierce Inverarity to
				open an armoire containing a page from <cite class="title italic">The Courier’s
				Tragedy</cite> (a book discovered by Oedipa in <cite class="title italic">The Crying of
					Lot 49</cite>), which offers a clue to talk to a dreaming child from chapter
				five. The child sends the player to talk to the drunken sailor, who asks the player
				(as he asks Oedipa) to deliver a letter through the underground postal service or
					"W.A.S.T.E. system." After the player does this, the
				sailor gives the player a golden posthorn, which must be returned to Pierce
				Inverarity. Each of the non-player characters’ dialogue gives some explanation of
				the significance of the player’s tasks, which the student group elaborates on in the
				notes for their presentation. The students write, "Our focus was
					on polar opposites in the novel, with an extreme emphasis on sacred and profane
					images. This is reflected in our setting, characters, and humor." The
				students thus organized their project around the religious subtext of Pynchon’s
				novel, as first analyzed by Edward Mendelson in "The Sacred, the
					Profane, and <cite class="title italic">The Crying of Lot 49</cite>". The game
				is filled with clever allusions to the novel, and (as its name suggests) is strongly
				symbolic. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29"> However, the relationship between meaning and action in the second group's game is
				not as well integrated as in <cite class="title italic">Oedipa’s Quest</cite>, in part
				because the students became a little too immersed in the whimsical humor of their
				game. Students created a world in which Pierce Inverarity has been transformed into
				a polar bear, and random creatures such as talking penguins periodically appear.
				Nevertheless, because the group also strove to be faithful to the details of
				Pynchon’s text, they found that elements they originally intended to be humorous
				acquired meaning within the context of the quest. Indeed, Pynchon’s idea of a "high magic to low puns" suggests that his own aesthetic
				draws its own power from seemingly absurd jokes that reveal serious thematic
				implications upon a second look [<a class="ref" href="#pynchon1964">Pynchon 1964</a>, 129]. Thus, the
					"polar" bear in the group’s prototype lead them to
				think about "polar" opposites running through the organization of
				their game, in which each object, character, and setting has its mirrored,
				symmetrical counterpart. The students write: <blockquote><p>We split the
					geography into two separate but equal parts. Where one side has a very nice
					house, the other side has a slummy inn. One side has a nice garden with children
					and flowers; the other side contains ruins and skeletal remains. [...] The areas
					are separated by the river, water, a polar molecule. A single bridge connects
					the two, representing how sacred and profane are eternally linked within the
					novel’s universe. </p></blockquote> Chance puns on the word "polar" yield
				an organizational principle for the quest, in which the player must help an
				isolated, marginalized sailor to communicate through an underground postal box in
				the middle of town, thereby bridging the sacred and the profane both figuratively
				and literally. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30"> In addition to this successful use of emblematic spaces, students wrote not only
				about the spaces of the quest but also about its rules and challenges, in order to
				emphasize that a quest is a goal-oriented search for meaning rather than unfocused
				wandering through multiple interpretations. Classroom game design need not consist
				primarily of a set of rules that the instructor imposes upon a class in order to
				guide discussion, but rather students should be at least partially responsible for
				designing these rules if gaming is to fulfill the promise of interactivity. When
				students supported their ideas about gameplay with interpretative analysis of the
				book, they produced a context for meaning that was both creative and interpretative.
				For example, Jason Kimbrell designed an action game about Pynchon’s use of Jungian
				shadow archetypes. In this game, players would have not only standard combat moves
				but also an "interpret" move, akin to the "combo" or
					"finishing" moves in martial arts games. The
				"interpret" move would give characters the opportunity to experience
				sympathy for a demonized and shadowy Other, thereby humanizing an enemy instead of
				defeating it. Kimbrell writes: <blockquote><p>As enemies in the game, the Shadow will be portrayed as
						monsters. Oedipa has two options while fighting these creatures. She can
						kill them, like a normal action game, or she can ‘interpret’ them. Once she
						initiates the command, a quick cut-scene plays revealing the monster as a
						human being and Oedipa learns a special move specific to that monster. The
						downside to this is that interpretation has a high fail rate, which makes
						execution difficult.  [<a class="ref" href="#kimbrell2006">Kimbrell 2006</a>]</p></blockquote> Kimbrell thus retained the challenge and violence of the typical "kill
					quest" with gameplay that required players to enact subtle, postmodern,
				and self-reflective ideas about tolerance for the demonized Other. His gameplay is
				meta-interpretative, introducing interpretation as itself a move in the game: one
				that is rendered not only as an abstract cognitive maneuver but also as a difficult
					"combo move" in a well-designed martial arts combat game.
				Instructors uncomfortable with the violence of video games or seeking to encourage
				readings of bloody epic and romance through the more reflective lens of postcolonial
				or feminist theory could use this student’s idea as a template for alternative
				approaches to Beowulf, the Arthurian legends, or any text that prominently features
				a protagonist challenged with slaying a monstrous Other. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31"> Further inquiry into the theory and practice of quest design will allow literary
				scholars, games researchers, and game designers to find linkages between a tradition
				of games extending from King’s Quest to <cite class="title italic">The Elder Scrolls IV:
					Oblivion</cite>, as well as from Homer’s Odyssey to <cite class="title italic">The
					Crying of Lot 49</cite>. As the academic study of games matures, the study of
				quests offers a possible bridge between games and narratives that can help us to
				progress beyond the divisive ludology versus narratology debate without losing sight
				of the venerable, implied questions about interpretative freedom, imagination, and
				the human search for meaning that made this debate so fierce in the first place.
				Moreover, further research into the history and theory of quests can take its place
				among a variety of studies of particular game genres that emerge as New Media
				researchers move past the first discipline-founding steps of game studies and into
				the specific inquiries that will bear the fruit of this discipline. The importance
				of studying quests specifically can only increase as MMORPG’s and RPG’s for the
				next-generation consoles boast of "quest systems" that contain
				thousands of "side quests", often interlaced with an epic main quest
				whose dramatic sweep still corresponds to the ancient model of the hero’s journey.
				Because quests are also a structural paradigm that connects hundreds of literary
				works from myriad periods and genres, pedagogical applications of quests can
				potentially benefit humanities teachers in a broad range of educational situations.
				These applications could range from honors seminars introducing students to ancient
				epic, to thematic classes about the relationship between New Media and literature,
				to single-author "major figures" courses on authors as diverse as
				Edmund Spenser and Thomas Pynchon. Moreover, the most productive questions about
				quests may come from a design perspective, addressing the issue of how to relate
				theoretical understandings of quests with their enactment in gameplay. Since quests
				operate as a formal structure in narrative and an activity in games, the adaptation
				of narratives into games requires not just a theoretical consideration of
				interactivity but of the practical action that scholars, educators, and designers
				can themselves take in order to produce this interactivity. New Media theorists need
				to consider what technological skill-sets might be required in order to produce
				meaningful action in games, and how strategies derived from the literary tradition
				of quest games could be used to create this action. My own book in progress, <cite class="title italic">Quests: Design, Theory, and History in Games and
				Narratives</cite>, discusses ways that a literary technique of symbolic
				correspondences derived from medieval romance and Renaissance allegory can help
				designers to construct games in which meaning emerges from gameplay. Four components
				of a theory of quests (a quest system of journal updates and conversations with
				non-player characters, spaces, objects, challenges) can themselves "correspond" to
				another set of design skills (journal management and dialogue construction, level
				design, creation of quest items, and programming within game engines or
					"scripting"). If we treat the quest in its etymological sense as
				a kind of "inquest" or "inquiry" in which players and
				designers produce meaning rather than passively consuming it, then the next step in
				this inquiry may be to ask how we can actively create meaning through our design
				decisions. </div></div></div><div id="worksCited"><h2>Works Cited</h2><div class="bibl fallback"><span class="ref" id="aarseth1997"><!-- close -->Aarseth 1997</span> Aarseth, Espen. <cite class="title italic">Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature</cite>.
