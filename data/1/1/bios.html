        at the University of Virginia and Professor in the Department of English. In 2000, she
        helped establish the Speculative Computing Laboratory, a research group dedicated to
        exploring experimental projects in Humanities Computing. Her recent work focuses on
        aesthetics and digital media, particularly graphical communication and the expressive
        character of visual form. She is well known for her publications on the history of
        written forms, typography, design, and visual poetics. Her most recent critical work,
        Sweet Dreams: Contemporary Art and Complicity was published by the University of Chicago
        Press in Spring 2005.</div><div class="ptext" id="flanders_j"><strong>Julia Flanders</strong> Julia Flanders was born and raised in the New Jersey suburbs, and
				attended a local public high school where computers were taught as Computer Math. She
				received her first undergraduate degree from Harvard in History and Literature, and her
				second from Cambridge University in English Literature. In 1989 she began a PhD in
				English at Brown University, but migrated early in her graduate studies into humanities
				computing. She started working at the Women Writers Project in 1992, first as a
				proofreader, then as Managing Editor, Textbase Editor, and Project Manager. Upon
				completing her doctorate in 2005 ("on Digital Humanities and the Politics of Scholarly
				Work") she found herself with enough free time to work on the founding of a digital
				journal.<p>Julia currently works as the Director of the Women Writers Project at Brown University,
					where her research focuses on the challenges of digital text representation, text
					encoding, and scholarly communication. She also does a variety of freelance technology
					consulting. She has written and spoken on a variety of issues including the gender
					politics of scholarly digital editing, documentation, the history of quantitative
					methods of literary analysis, digital textuality and materiality, and various practical
					problems in text encoding. She has served as Vice President of ACH and Chair of the Text
					Encoding Initiative Consortium.</p></div><div class="ptext" id="howard_j"><strong>Jeff Howard</strong> Jeff Howard teaches at the University of Texas, Austin, where he
				studies New Media and literature. He received his B.A. in English from the University of
				Tulsa in May 2000 and his M.A. in English from the University of Texas in May 2002. He
				successfully defended his dissertation, entitled Heretical Reading: Freedom as Question
				and Process in Postmodern American Novel and Technological Pedagogy, in fall 2005 and
				will receive his Ph.D. in English in May 2007. He is currently working on a book-length
				project called Quests: Design, Theory, and History in Games and Narratives.</div><div class="ptext" id="patrik_l"><strong>Linda E. Patrik</strong> Linda E. Patrik, Professor of Philosophy at Union College, works on
				bridges between Asian philosophy and western philosophy, particularly with regard to
				ethical issues and philosophical issues concerning the nature of consciousness. She has
				studied and taught with Tibetan Buddhist philosophers at the Nitartha Institute, and she
				is part of a Tibetan text preservation effort based at Nitartha International's Document
				Input Center in Kathmandu.</div><div class="ptext" id="piez_w"><strong>Wendell Piez</strong> Wendell Piez was born in Frankfurt, Germany to American parents, and
				raised in Somerville (Massachussets), Kabul (Afghanistan), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania),
				Manila (the Philippines), Reston (Virginia), and Tokyo (Japan), before attending
				university in New Haven (Connecticut). A graduate of the American School in Japan and of
				Yale College (MC 1984), where he received a BA in Classics (Ancient Greek), he has been
				using and programming computers since 1977 (BASIC, 6502 Assembler). From 1985 to 1998 he
				attended and taught at Rutgers University, where he specialized in English literature,
				critical theory, poetics and rhetoric. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1991 (writing on the
				aesthetic theory and prose practice of the Victorian literary critic and belletrist
				Walter Pater), he worked in Rutgers University Special Collections and Archives
				(1991-1995) and on the faculty at CETH (the Center for Electronic Texts in the
				Humanities, 1995-1998). Since 1998, he has been employed by Mulberry Technologies, Inc.,
				a consultancy in private practice, where he is responsible for the development and
				application of electronic text technologies both for clients and in house. Author and
				presenter of journal articles, papers and courses presented at academic and industry
				conferences and teaching events, he is a regular contributor to HUMANIST, TEI-L, and
				XSL-LIST, a recognized expert in XML, XSLT and related technologies such as SVG, and
				co-originator of LMNL, the Layered Markup and Annotation Language. He resides in scenic
				Shepherdstown, West Virginia.</div><div class="ptext" id="raben_j"><strong>Joseph Raben</strong> Joseph Raben is a professor emeritus of English at Queens College of
				the City University of New York, where he taught for 30 years. Before that he was a
				teaching fellow at Indiana University and an instructor at Princeton University. He was
				awarded a B.A. with honors at the University of Wisconsin and a Ph.D. at Indiana
				University, where he minored in folklore under Stith Thompson. His bachelor's honors
				thesis was on pronunciation as revealed by rhyme schemes in American folksongs, and his
				doctoral dissertation studied folk speech in Scott's novels. After graduating from
				Wisconsin, he worked as an engineering aide on the construction of the Hanford Engineer
				Works, and then entered the Army, where he was trained in spoken Japanese and served in
				Tokyo as an editor of translations in the Allied Translator and Interpreter Service,
				attached to GHQ. In this service he translated documents used in the war crimes trials.<p>At Queens he developed an interest in using computers in humanities research and in 1966
					founded the innovative journal <span class="italic">Computers and the Humanities</span> to provide a
					platform for younger pioneering scholars to publish their research. He both edited and
					carried a large share of this journal's publication chores for 20 years. Among its most
					useful features was a semiannual <span class="italic">Directory of Scholars Active</span>, which informed
					practitioners around the world of recent applications of computer technology to
					humanities and related social science problems. These notes he cumulated into a print
					volume, <span class="italic">Computer-Assisted Research in the Humanities</span> (New York: Pergamon Press,
					1977). In 1978 he founded the Association for Computers and the Humanities and served as
					its president for two years before turning it over to younger successors. During this
					same period, he helped to organize several international conferences at the University
					of Southern California, Grinnell College, Dartmouth College, Rutgers University, North
					Carolina State University and Auburn University. He also presented papers at many
					international conferences organized by others and represented humanities computing at
					conferences organized by groups within the computer industry, such as the ACM, the
					American Federation of Information Processing Societies, the International Federation
					for Information Processing, and the American Society for Information Science. He
					organized special interest groups at several MLA conventions and within the ACM. He was
					an invited lecturer at academic institutions all over the United States, Canada, and
					Western Europe, and in India, China, and Japan. Much of the same effort was contained in
					articles published in a variety of journals, along with his contributions to Shelley
					scholarship, some of it based on the manuscript materials in the Bodleian Library.</p></div><div class="ptext" id="terras_m"><strong>Melissa Terras</strong> Melissa Terras hails from Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, and ignored
				computers until her final year of her undergraduate MA, in History of Art and English
				Literature at the University of Glasgow (1998). Discovering the Internet (and something
				that she was good at) led to an MSc in IT (Software and Systems), also at Glasgow in
				1999. In 2002 she completed her doctorate at the University of Oxford, which was a joint
				project between the Department of Engineering Science and the Centre for the Study of
				Ancient Documents, on using image processing and artificial intelligence to try and
				read the Roman documents from Vindolanda.<p>Melissa then spent a year at the Royal Academy of Engineering, as assistant manager of
					the Policy unit, providing impartial advice to the UK government on matters scientific.
					Now at University College London, she is a lecturer in the School of Library, Archive,
					and Information Studies on Internet Technologies, Web Publishing, and Digital Resources
					in the Humanities. She is acting Secretary of ALLC (2005/6) and an Officer of the
					Association for Computers and the Humanities (2005-8), as well as being involved in
					other consultancy activities within the Digital Humanities field. She is interested in
					computational techniques which would allow research in the Humanities that would
					otherwise be impossible.</p></div><div class="ptext" id="vandecreek_d"><strong>Drew VandeCreek</strong> Drew E. VandeCreek is Director of Digital Projects at Northern Illinois
