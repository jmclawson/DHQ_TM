			from India, keeping the tradition of Buddhist philosophy and meditation alive long after
			it died out in India by the 12th Century. The accuracy of the Tibetan translations of
			Sanskrit Buddhist texts meant that modern scholars could establish the oldest versions
			of Buddhist theories with some reliability. As the 19th Century scholar F. Max Müller
			noted, <blockquote><p>The Tibetan version [of The Buddha-karita of Asvaghosha] appears
					to be much closer to the original Sanskrit than the Chinese; in fact from its
					verbal accuracy we can often reproduce the exact words of the original, since
					certain Sanskrit words are always represented by the same Tibetan equivalents,
					as for instance the prepositions prefixed to verbal roots.  [<a class="ref" href="#muller1894">Müller 1894</a>, vii]</p></blockquote> Known not only for their care in translation but also for their understanding of
			Buddhism, Tibet’s monastic scholars added commentaries to the original Indian root
			texts, and they established hundreds of libraries and universities where the texts could
			be studied. Through the ages, Tibet’s ancient texts have received careful handling and
			storage as sacred texts; they were printed by hand from wood blocks, wrapped in silk
			covers, and stored on shelves behind the main altars of the shrine rooms in monasteries
			and temples. Representing one of the Three Jewels of Buddhism — the Dharma — the texts
			instruct Buddhists on how to achieve enlightenment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">But canonical texts represent only one piece of what has always been a multimedia
			enactment of the key meanings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the particular form of Buddhism
			that Tibet inherited from India. Vajrayana Buddhism (also known as Tantra) emphasizes
			intensive meditation, but its meditation methods incorporate complex visual imagery,
			bodily movements, the sounds of drums and horns, as well as the chanting of the texts
			within the overall container of quiet meditation practice. Instructions on these
			visualizations, bodily gestures and chanting practices have been passed down through
			oral lineages, teacher to student, codified by sacred rituals in which monastics joined
			together in learning and standardizing these practices. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Today the Tibetan textual tradition faces extinction unless serious efforts are made to
			preserve it and the Vajrayana practices it supports. In the years following the Chinese
			invasion of Tibet in the 1950s, Tibetan scholars struggled to preserve and circulate the
			classical texts of their ancient Buddhist heritage. Many books were lost during the
			1960s and 70s when the Chinese launched the Cultural Revolution on Tibetan soil,
			destroying the libraries, temples, monasteries and universities in Tibet that had kept
			the books safe. Some important, time-honored texts elucidating Tibet’s distinctive
			Vajrayana meditation methods, liturgies and philosophical investigations may never be
			found again, although the search by Tibetans still continues today for these famous
			commentaries and instruction manuals. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The Tibetan scholars who fled into India first attempted to preserve the texts they
			carried with them by printing the texts without delay. But at that time, the paper
			available in India was of such poor quality (it was non-acid-free paper or rice paper)
			that the print bled through from both sides, making the texts illegible [<a class="ref" href="#marvet2006">Marvet 2006</a>]. Many classical Tibetan texts were never reprinted at all but
			were left in their original hand-printed, woodblock form (called "pecha"
			texts; see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). The lack of facilities and poor economic
			conditions for Tibetan refugees as they scattered abroad introduced added risks for the
			storage of their paper texts. Simply transcribing the rescued texts and protecting them
			in archives were stopgap measures. With Tibetan refugees living in India, Europe, North
			America, South America, and other parts of Asia, it was impossible to establish
			centrally located archives where all Tibetans could easily study the texts and learn the
			highly detailed Vajrayana meditation methods described in the texts. When Western
			scholars and meditators became interested in learning about Tibetan Buddhism, they also
			found it difficult to locate or understand the old Tibetan texts mentioned in more
			recent commentaries. Not only were indigenous Tibetan scholars unable to verify which
			ancient texts had actually been preserved or where the texts had been stored, but the
			iconography and complex symbolism associated with Vajrayana texts were not explained in
			the texts themselves. </div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt="An image of three Tibetan texts"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>Tibetan "pecha" texts</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5"> By the late 1980s Tibetan scholars recognized the possibilities of digital formats for
			preserving their texts and for circulating the texts amongst the far-flung members of
			the Tibetan community [<a class="ref" href="#chilton2006">Chilton 2006</a>]. Digitized texts could be made
			accessible to Tibetan and western scholars around the world through the Internet, and
			digital formats also made cataloguing the texts and searching for specific titles
			easier, so that a more accurate assessment could be made of which texts had survived and
			which texts were still missing. Several digitizing projects began in India, Nepal,
			Europe and North America. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6"> Today, after over a decade of work, there are digital archives of thousands of Tibetan
				books.<a class="noteRef" href="#d25872e115">[1]</a>
			For example, one of the Tibetan scholars committed to digitizing the Tibetan canon, the
			Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, established the Nitartha International Document Input Center
			in Kathmandu, Nepal, with a team of Tibetan monks, Tibetan refugees born in diaspora,
			and western computer specialists. At the Input Center, indigenous Tibetan scholars
			represent classical Tibetan texts in digital formats that would be most useful for
			Tibetan scholars in exile and for Tibetan translators. In addition to its digitization
			of texts, Nitartha International has developed a Tibetan font software, several
			informative websites on Tibetan Buddhism, and modern educational materials linked to
			classical texts, such as CDs with interactive modules that outline the logic of
			philosophical arguments, define basic concepts used in Buddhist philosophy, and
			represent key points through visual images. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7"> Recently, some indigenous Tibetan scholars have also begun to learn TEI encoding for
			their digitized texts. The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is an XML language designed
			for representing literary and historical texts. Maintained by an international
			consortium of major universities, the TEI publishes detailed guidelines and
			documentation of this language, maintains a listserv for questions, trouble-shooting and
			general discussion amongst TEI users, and holds a yearly meeting for the hundreds of TEI
			projects and encoders scattered around the world. What Tibetan scholars see in TEI is
			not only a markup language, but a flexible text publishing method for digital texts, a
			cataloguing schema for archiving the texts, and an application that will make it easier
			to conduct analytical searches and link the texts to their translations. One obstacle to
			using TEI (or any XML language) for the Tibetan canon is that Unicode for the Tibetan
			language only became available recently, in partial form. Even though texts can now be
			encoded in Unicode, they cannot be printed in the Tibetan Unicode script. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">This example of Tibetan scholars experimenting with TEI for their ancient texts shows the
			promise of TEI for multicultural texts. Multiculturalism as a theoretical approach aims
			to respect the autonomy and value of other cultures. Recently, the TEI consortium has
			initiated a project to translate its Guidelines into as many languages as possible [<a class="ref" href="#rahtz2005">Rahtz 2005</a>]. Without denying the very concrete economic and political
			forces that create the Digital Divide, the TEI consortium intends to support indigenous
			scholars as they protect and sustain their own textual traditions. In this way the Text
			Encoding Initiative is expanding its work beyond its original North American and
			European borders, becoming a global digital technology that is supportive of
			multicultural textual traditions. The TEI consortium has welcomed Tibetan forays into
			what started as a western scholarly undertaking, because TEI members understand that
			text preservation by multicultural, and especially minority, populations is important.
			Providing indigenous scholars and teachers with tools for keeping their textual
			traditions alive helps secure the future for all the literatures of the world. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9"> Not only is TEI an important strategy for preserving rare texts, but the TEI Guidelines
			offer a standard set of schemas and documentation that is widely used in the
			international scholarly community. By representing their texts through this scholarly
			framework, indigenous Tibetan scholars can introduce their textual tradition to the
			wider scholarly community. Over the centuries, Tibetan scholars have developed a
			painstaking system for marking up the internal organization of their texts — a system
			which delineates between several layers of scholastic commentaries on the original
			Sanskrit root text. Its inherent complexity makes the Tibetan canon a natural for TEI
			encoding. The TEI guidelines have been designed with complex historical texts in mind —
			the texts expected to endure through the ages. The guidelines also offer specific ways
			to represent the complicated scholarly features of historical texts. This precision of
			TEI encoding is a good match for the complexity of Tibet’s commentarial tradition.
			Tibetan commentaries form a nesting structure, such that later commentaries include and
			surround earlier commentaries, which themselves include and surround the original Indian
				Sutra.<a class="noteRef" href="#d25872e145">[2]</a> The Tibetan commentaries proceed paragraph
			by paragraph, verse by verse, or sometimes even line by line in explicating the meaning
			of the earlier text(s). All of these complicated internal divisions of a text can be
			captured by TEI encoding. TEI encoding can also represent linkages between texts, for
			example between the original Tibetan text and translations of the text in western
			languages. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">As an example, consider the following passage from a Tibetan commentary which concerns
			the differences between two philosophical schools, the Consequentialists and the
			Autonomists. The indented verses are from a root text, Nagarjuna’s Fundamental Verses on
			Centrism. Generally, Tibetan commentaries such as the one below quote lines from the
			earlier root text and then explain the meaning of that quoted passage in detail or
			explore the philosophical debates that have arisen in response to that passage. </div><div class="example"><blockquote><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">6.2.1.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.

			kind of basic encoding. Because the TEI was initially developed by scholars familiar
			with the western textual tradition, features of some non-western textual traditions may
			pose theoretical and practical challenges, and may require some adaptation of the TEI.
			For example, one important feature is the enunciative mode associated with the text. It
			is not irrelevant to Tibetan scholars whether a text is chanted, read silently,
			transmitted by a teacher in a lung (a ritual that empowers listeners to practice
			meditation or study denoted by the text), or scanned on a computer screen. Tibetans
			believe that their texts do not simply record information but actually embody ancient
			ideas or meanings that, in some situations, require appropriate methods of transmission.
			Thus if we were to understand Tibetan texts according to a theoretical and operational
			paradigm that treats them only as information, we would not only lose the original
			Tibetan cultural context but would lose the different degrees of "transmission
				power" said to be generated by different media (reading, chanting, lung
			transmission, etc.) within the Tibetan textual tradition. This representation of the
			enunciative mode, which is essential to practicing with Tibetan texts, might be
			accomplished by additional, customized TEI elements for the chanted sections of the
			texts. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12"> Another challenging dimension is the readers’ actions in association with a text. Some
			of the most advanced Tibetan meditation techniques include hand movements (called
			mudras; <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a> shows examples of these gestures), bodily
			movements (such as prostrations), chanting, and complex visualizations. Texts are always
			central to these meditation methods, but engagement with the Vajrayana text is far more
			active than what occurs by simply reading or even chanting the text. <div id="figure02" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/figure02.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/figure02.jpg" alt="Image of two Tibetan monks leading a meditation"/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche and Bardor Tulku Rinpoche leading a Vajrayana
					meditation by chanting a text and doing mudras</div></div> For example, one of the sections of the "Medicine
			Buddha" meditation (which is used for healing) requires special hand movements
			(mudras), performed while imagining a dark blue Buddha figure as one chants the mantra
			of Medicine Buddha. The co-ordination of body (mudras), speech (mantra), and mind
			(visualization of blue Buddha figure; see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>) is
			difficult but necessary for the Vajrayana meditation practice. Instructions on how to
			perform the mudras and how to chant the mantra are not in the Tibetan text itself; the
			image of the blue Buddha is not in the text either. Traditionally, the mudras and chant

			the text being encoded: in an important sense, they are integral parts of the text and
			its meaning, without which it cannot be said to be truly preserved. Tibetans are intent
			upon preserving their textual heritage, but not simply as information in storage.
			Instead, they aim for "real preservation" that records and encodes enough
			of the living textual tradition so that the texts may be taken up again by future
			generations in a way that continues Tibetan culture’s most meaningful values and
			customs. Transcription or simple digitization of Tibetan texts constitutes mere
				"storage preservation"; the texts may be read and studied in the
			future, but their Vajrayana elements of mantra, mudra and meditation will not be
			captured, since these elements need to be practiced "live", so to speak,
			not just read. If a Tibetan text sits in a library or a digital archive, but no one
			knows how to chant it or meditate with it or debate in response to it, then the text has
			lost virtually all of its meaning. The fossil of the text would be preserved, but the
			text itself would have become extinct. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Real preservation requires the help of indigenous "text custodians" who
			teach the traditional ways of working with the texts. This is a pressing concern because
			the older Tibetan teachers who were born in Tibet before the diaspora will die in the
			next decade or two. When they are gone, there may no longer be Buddhist practitioners
			who know exactly how to chant certain texts or how to perform mudras in connection with
			specific textual passages or how to lead more complex rituals based on the texts. To
			preserve as complete a record as possible, so that the texts can live again in the
			meditation practices and rituals performed with the texts, the gestural, musical and
			mental dimensions of these texts must ideally also be recorded. Linking audio, video,
			and images to the transcriptions may help, but it may also be worth exploring ways to
			notate gestural and other information within the transcription itself. The TEI offers
			some approaches to this in its chapters on transcription of speech and on performance
			texts, and these could be extended further to accommodate the distinctive combination of
			information carried in Tibetan texts. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">The encoded TEI file can also form the basis of a more complex multimedia representation.
			The TEI version of the Medicine Buddha liturgy can be linked to an audio file of the
			correct pronunciation and melody of the mantra, to pictures of the hand mudras that must
			be performed during the chanting of the text, and to a visual image of the blue Buddha
			figure. The TEI transcription itself can also contain instructions on how to perform the
			mudras or other bodily movements that occur at each point in the text, allowing them to
			be displayed or suppressed as appropriate. By linking the TEI transcription to
			multimedia resources, an editor could allow the appearance of videos, graphics or photos
			as memory aids at certain points in the text, which would help the reader/practitioner
			perform the visualization of the Buddha figure. An example is shown in <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>, which gives the text of a chant in multiple scripts
			together with a description of the mudras to be performed; these mudras are illustrated
			in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> below. The practitioner's voicing of the chant
			could be corrected or accompanied by an audio file of an indigenous Tibetan chant
			master's articulation or by an audio file of Tibetan horns, symbols and bells. <div id="figure04" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/figure04.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/figure04.jpg" alt="Medicine Buddha text"/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div>Medicine Buddha text. © Heart Center Karma Thegsum Chöling</div></div><div id="table1" class="table"><table class="table"><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Argham</td><td valign="top" class="cell"><div class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/argham.gif" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/argham.gif" alt=""/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Padyam</td><td valign="top" class="cell"><div class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/padyam.gif" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/padyam.gif" alt=""/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Pupe</td><td valign="top" class="cell"><div class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/pupe.gif" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/pupe.gif" alt=""/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Dhupe</td><td valign="top" class="cell"><div class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/dhupe.gif" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/dhupe.gif" alt=""/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Aloke</td><td valign="top" class="cell"><div class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/aloke.gif" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/aloke.gif" alt=""/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Gendhe</td><td valign="top" class="cell"><div class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/gendhe.gif" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/gendhe.gif" alt=""/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Newidye</td><td valign="top" class="cell"><div class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/newidye.gif" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/newidye.gif" alt=""/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div></td></tr><tr class="row"><td valign="top" class="cell">Shapda</td><td valign="top" class="cell"><div class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/shapda.gif" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000004/resources/images/shapda.gif" alt=""/></a><div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div></td></tr></table><div class="caption"><div class="label">Table 1. </div>Diagram of mudras associated with Medicine Buddha text</div></div><div class="example"><div class="ptext">Click for an <a class="ref" href="resources/audio/mudra.wma" onclick="window.open('resources/audio/mudra.wma'); return false">audio file</a>

			around the world, who are struggling to protect their ancient cultural heritages?
			Ideally, we might envision creating a simple shared descriptive system to facilitate the
			cataloguing of endangered texts, so that international scholars become more aware of
			which texts have been lost and which have been saved. Ideally such a system would be
			easy to learn, by any scholar, working in any language. However, the significant
			differences between textual traditions and descriptive goals make it hard to create a
			system that would be both simple and widely agreed upon. It may be more practical to
			work on disseminating TEI expertise more widely among "text custodians".
			A second step, therefore, would be to hold workshops on these digital technologies in
			the universities and teachers’ colleges of developing countries. The Digital Divide is
			closing in some parts of the world (for example, India), and outreach from well-endowed
			scholarly communities to poorer scholarly communities could include the sharing of
			digital methods for preserving texts. Supported by occasional workshops, a virtual,
			international community of "text custodians" trained in TEI could grow
			and bridge the Digital Divide between developed and developing countries. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17"> In this endeavor, it is important to respect the control that indigenous scholars have
			over their own textual heritage. A textual heritage is a cultural property that can
			speak to the world, but it should be maintained by the people whose ancestors created
			it. If there are traditional rules about access to certain texts, digital technologies
			should not bypass these rules. Digital technologies should not be used to appropriate
			the world’s textual riches or simply to add inventory to western digital archives. The
			model of broad "access" that often motivates western digitization efforts
			does not apply universally, and may in some cases go directly against the indigenous
			textual tradition. This issue comes up with regard to Tibetan texts, because some of
			these texts are esoteric texts, reserved for advanced meditators. It is generally
			presumed by western scholars that increased access to texts is better. But this
			presumption is not shared by Tibetan scholars, who deal with texts that require special
			permission and instruction from a qualified teacher before they can be read, studied,
			chanted or memorized. The restricted nature of some Tibetan texts relates to the
			difficulty of the meditation practices described in the text. Not everyone has advanced
			meditation skills or sufficient commitment to undertake the mental training methods
			relayed in the text. Before the Chinese invasion of Tibet, there were monastic libraries
			that contained esoteric volumes which never circulated beyond the monastery or even
			amongst all members of the monastery. Thus although most western scholars do not
			consider "trespassing" a serious textual practice crime, Tibetan scholars
			might regard TEI-encoded texts as inviting trespassers. This is why it is essential for
			any multicultural development of TEI to involve indigenous scholars, who understand the
			threats faced by their endangered textual tradition and are committed to protecting it. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">When a culture is endangered, as the Tibetan culture is, members of that culture not only
			try to preserve its texts but try to continue the rituals and other practices that keep
			the culture alive. Transcribing texts and digitizing them are important preservation
			methods, but these methods need to be supplemented with other tools for awakening the
			texts from their archival slumber. The benefits of TEI encoding for the Tibetan canon
			range from enhanced preservation of the texts and greater accessibility for scholars, to
			support for the continuation of Vajrayana meditation practices that renew the Tibetan
			Buddhist heritage. Despite the challenges of reconciling Tibetan textual assumptions and
			western digital methods, especially if Tibetan scholars themselves learn to apply TEI
			encoding there is a chance that 21st century technology will not leave the ancient
			Tibetan textual tradition behind. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">Why are modern digital methods such as TEI encoding so important for endangered Tibetan
			texts? There are a couple of reasons. First, digital text applications support the
			Tibetan scholarly community, which is spread across the globe. Online digitized Tibetan
			texts can be accessed by a Tibetan in exile no matter where he or she has taken up
			residence. The circulation of texts is made easier when the cataloguing and searching of
			texts follows standardized guidelines, and TEI encoding provides just this kind of
			standardized information. The other side of this point, however, is that the exiled
			Tibetan scholarly community lacks the kind of financial support that a government would
			normally provide for modernizing its textual tradition; this community must rely on the
			largesse of western scholarly institutions. By concerning itself with the plight of
			endangered textual traditions, the Text Encoding Initiative might provide aid to these
			Tibetan scholars in exile.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Another reason is that TEI encoding gives the Tibetan textual tradition entrance to an
			international scholarly enterprise that may make it easier for non-Tibetans to
			understand Tibetan Buddhism. Even though the Tibetan Buddhist tradition is being lost on
			its home soil, an international Tibetan Buddhist culture is appearing. Scholars and
			meditators in Europe and the western hemisphere are studying Vajrayana Buddhism and
			practicing its meditation methods, liturgies and philosophical debate techniques.
			Vajrayana Buddhism depends upon the direct transmission of teachings from a qualified
			teacher to students, but there is also a virtual dimension to this spread of Tibetan
			Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhists often go online to find information and to communicate with
			one another; digital technologies have been used to forge connections between western
			newcomers to Tibetan Buddhism and indigenous Tibetan monks and nuns. Compared to the
			restrictions on the study and practice of Tibetan Buddhism within Tibet itself, there is
			greater freedom online to discuss the issues and share the achievements that are
			important to Tibetan Buddhists. This global Tibetan Buddhist community is forming with
			the aid of digital communication tools unavailable twenty years ago. The adoption of TEI
			encoding will add a scholarly tool to this digital toolkit.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Finally, the rich heritage of Vajrayana Buddhism cannot be represented by a
			one-dimensional medium. Its exuberant visual imagery, its complex symbolism, its
			deep-toned chanting and music, and its engagement of the body in ritualized motions
			combine within the most advanced meditation practices. Although Tibetans do practice
			quiet, unmoving meditation, what is distinctive about the Tibetan tradition is the
			overabundance of forms — painting, music, ritualized gesture, chanting, dance, even
			formal philosophical debate — within its meditation practices. Digital technologies
			capture this rich dimension of Tibetan texts better than the simple transcription of
			texts can. Because TEI encoding offers ways to release a Tibetan liturgy, meditation
			manual or philosophical inquiry from its text-cocoon and express its full
			multidimensionality, TEI is one of the digital technologies that holds promise for
			preserving the Vajrayana textual tradition.</div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Acknowledgements</h1><div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item"> Jeff Hoogmoed, http://www.freespacegraphix.biz</li><li class="item"> Union College East Asian Studies Freeman Foundation grant</li><li class="item"> Union College Humanities Faculty Development grant</li><li class="item"> Editors of Digital Humanities Quarterly </li><li class="item"> Photographs courtesy of Tenzin Namdak, Nitartha International Document Input
