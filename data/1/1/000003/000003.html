				L. Ayers, developer of the award-winning The Valley of the Shadow Project (<a class="ref" href="http://valley.vcdh.virginia.edu/" onclick="window.open('http://valley.vcdh.virginia.edu/'); return false">http://valley.vcdh.virginia.edu</a>),
				has argued that "history may be better suited to digital
					technology than any other humanistic discipline." Nevertheless, he notes
				that "the great democratization of history over the last few
					decades has not been accompanied by a democratization of audience." The
				rise of scholarship examining "a diversity of populations,
					topics and approaches in ways unimagined a few generations ago" has often
				left the academy "disconnected from the desires of the general
					reading public." He muses that "perhaps the tools of
					the digital world can help us out of this lull." Lincoln/Net suggests how
				historians may indeed address this lull by building on the foundation of online
				resources that librarians have fashioned [<a class="ref" href="#ayers1999">Ayers 1999</a>, 1–2].<a class="noteRef" href="#d29e124">[1]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Despite historians’ prominent roles in the development of several well-known digital
            	library projects, librarians have been prime movers in the development of online historical resources featuring primary source materials. Since the mid-1990s, they
				have used the World Wide Web, digital media formats, and database technology to
				provide a dramatically expanded public with an opportunity to consult books,
				manuscripts, and other resources long restricted in their use due to their rarity
				and fragility. Historically oriented digital libraries, most developed by college,
				university, and other research libraries, have been a boon to these institutions’
				core users: scholars, teachers, and students. These patrons readily grasp the
				context in which historical actors produced and collected primary source
				materials—scholars from a career’s reading in the secondary literature and students
				from their course of instruction. But members of the general public often find
				digital library materials, in spite of their ready availability online, inaccessible
				in another sense. Lacking a knowledge of historical context and interpretation, they
				find little meaning or significance in primary source materials’ discussion of
				events and controversies from the past. Only historians can provide this overlooked
				user group with the additional resources that they need to perceive and enjoy
				historical source materials. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Historians have yet to integrate much of their professional expertise into the
				digital libraries they produce. Many, like Ayers’ Valley of the Shadow, have
				facilitated the use of digital libraries by collecting materials pertaining to a
				specific place, period, or historical episode. But these resources largely stem from
				an idea originally developed by librarians, the idea of "access". One
				leading librarian has defined access as a patron’s "freedom or
					ability to obtain or make use of" library resources [<a class="ref" href="#borgman2000">Borgman 2000</a>, 53], and to date historically oriented digital
				libraries have afforded a dramatically expanded number of users with this benefit.
				But they provide their users with only a fraction of what historians have to share,
				namely the perceptions and debates unique to their discipline. For generations most
				historians have made the dissemination of their special knowledge a part of their
				work. A significant portion of the work that historians do outside the research
				arena consists of providing concise and polished accounts of interpretations that
				fellow scholars agree upon, or, as importantly, argue about, to non-specialist
				audiences. In classrooms, exhibits, and public programs alike, scholars labor to
				share historical interpretations with audiences. Yet these summaries remain largely
				absent on the free-use World Wide Web. Providing Web users with this knowledge,
				juxtaposed to the primary source materials upon which historians based their
				conclusions and debates, represents a large step forward in the democratization of
				history. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In recent years a number of leading historians have remarked upon their profession’s
				seemingly increasing detachment from public discourse. In 1986 Thomas Bender worried
				about "the declining significance of history in the general
						intellectual culture of our time" [<a class="ref" href="#bender1986">Bender 1986</a>, 120]. Eight years later he argued that "Professional historians are becoming increasingly isolated
						from the general public and writing primarily for other historians" [<a class="ref" href="#bender1994">Bender 1994</a>, 997]. In 1997 Joyce Appleby, in her capacity as president of the American
				Historical Association, insisted that, in addition to their scholarly work,
				professional historians have a responsibility to promote a better public
				understanding of how they go about the work of exploring and analyzing the past. She
				urged historians to "seek every possible opportunity to talk to a
						non-historian…about how history is produced" [<a class="ref" href="#britton1997">Britton 1997</a>, 23]. Douglas Greenberg scored "academic contempt for the
					public" and added that American historians faced an obligation to give
				the public the resources necessary to make interpretations of the past that "resonate with their own lives" [<a class="ref" href="#greenberg1998">Greenberg 1998</a>, 304]. Although primary source materials represented a significant component of
				these necessary resources, Greenberg emphasized that they also included "the best work that professional historians are capable of
						producing" [<a class="ref" href="#greenberg1998">Greenberg 1998</a>, 304]. A slowly increasing number of historians have begun to appear in documentary
				films and other public programs, and even on the World Wide Web. But many scholars
				do not seem to grasp how the World Wide Web can help them to reach the general
				public in new ways.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Over seventy years ago Carl Becker dubbed "Everyman His Own
					Historian" in an address to the American Historical Association. In it
				Becker called for a "living history" that would provide
				members of a broad audience with a sense of meaning and identity, rather than a
				history "that lies inert in unread books" and "does no work in the world". Even as his colleagues built a
				professional edifice around the goals of objectivity, Becker argued that history was "an imaginative creation, a personal possession which each
						one of us… fashions out of his individual experience" [<a class="ref" href="#woods1995">Woods 1995</a>, 1111]. Recent technological developments have helped Becker's vision come to
				fruition in ways that may discomfit many historians. A brief review of some
				historical materials available on the World Wide Web suggests that the rise of new
				technologies have helped individuals and groups lacking historical training to bring
				materials, often of dubious value, to a significant audience. If professional
				historians do not bring their ideas and interpretations to the free-use World Wide
				Web, this new generation of digital entrepreneurs will provide Web users with a
				variety of historical resources largely unsupported by their discipline’s standards
				and discourse. As increasing numbers of individuals turn to the World Wide Web as
				their reference tool of choice, this situation can only exacerbate historians’
				isolation and irrelevance in public discourse. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">II</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project builds upon the tradition
				initiated by the Library of Congress’ American Memory Project (<a class="ref" href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html" onclick="window.open('http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html'); return false">http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html</a>), the Valley of the Shadow
				Project, and other successful digital libraries and online archives. It began in
				1998 as a partnership in which a number of Illinois institutions, including museums,
				archives, and research and academic libraries, sought to share historical materials
				with the public. With the advent of the Internet and World Wide Web, representatives
				of these institutions met in the forum provided by a statewide library consortium to
				discuss potential ways in which they might use the new technologies to produce a
				digital library site combining materials from each of their collections. The subject
				of Abraham Lincoln quickly came to the surface. While the Library of Congress and
				National Archives hold large collections of Lincoln's presidential materials,
				resources from his life before the presidency remain scattered throughout the
				collections of individual libraries, museums, archives, and private individuals.
				Among these many collectors, Illinois institutions boasted some of the largest and
				most coherent collections of pre-presidential Lincolniana. The librarians and
				archivists planning the Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project thus focused
				their attention upon this period of Lincoln's life, much of which of course took
				place in Illinois itself. United in a single World Wide Web site, these materials
				could prove extremely useful to a variety of audiences.<a class="noteRef" href="#d29e201">[2]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Upon beginning work as Project Director in 1998, the author of this article brought
				an historian's perspective to a project facing several immediate challenges. While
				over a century of scholarship and study suggested that a large audience existed for
				online versions of Lincoln's letters, speeches, and other writings, these materials
				had been gathered and published as the <cite class="title italic">Collected Works of
					Abraham Lincoln</cite>, and were soon to be presented on the World Wide Web by
				another organization. A number of project planners had also suggested the
				digitization of large collections of materials created after Lincoln's death as
				parts of celebrated, subsequent, research projects or the larger cultural work of
				mythologizing a martyr president. But thanks to a large grant provided by the
				Illinois State Library (as agent for the Institute for Museum and Library Services),
				the project enjoyed an opportunity to grow in scope. In place of the official <cite class="title italic">Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</cite>, staff members
				identified an earlier compilation of Lincoln's works, prepared by his personal
				secretaries in the late nineteenth century and therefore in the public domain [<a class="ref" href="#hay1894">Hay and Nicolay 1894</a>]. These provided a core comprising Lincoln's writings and
				speeches. But the institutions collaborating in the project held collections
				containing far more than materials directly linked to Lincoln himself. Together they
				boasted extensive resources shedding light upon society and politics in Lincoln's
				era, the context in which he lived. These materials provided the project with an
				opportunity to use Lincoln's renown and high public standing to attract a public
				audience to a wide-ranging digital library. They also provided an interpretive
				framework that might make these materials more intelligible and attractive to novice
				users.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Abraham Lincoln clearly represents a popular, even iconic, figure in American
				history. The opportunity to reach a significant non-scholarly audience presented
				itself. But Lincoln's iconic stature did not begin with his assassination, or even
				his election to the presidency. During the heated campaign of 1860, Republican Party
				managers identified Lincoln, as yet largely unknown outside of his native Northwest,
				as a "rail splitter," a "representative man" [<a class="ref" href="#hinton1860">Hinton 1860</a>, 125] who shared experiences with many average Americans. Like many of his
				countrymen, Lincoln had moved west with his family in search of a better life. He
				had worked with his hands on farms, steered keelboats down the Mississippi, and
				fought in an Indian War. He could boast of very little formal education, and had
				failed in a number of occupations before finding that his talents suited the
				practice of law. As a politician he had lost more elections than he had won, but now
				had gained another opportunity to seize the main chance. When Republican leaders
				chose to identify Abraham Lincoln as a representative man, they hoped that he would
				serve as a lens through which Americans, or at least non-slaveholding Americans,
				might see themselves. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Likewise, Abraham Lincoln serves as a lens through which today's World Wide Web users
				may examine and interpret the past, and thus provides the Lincoln/Net site with an
				interpretive framework. His life experiences shed light upon significant themes that
				historians have developed in their discussion of the antebellum period. Lincoln's
				early struggles illuminate the realm of economic development and labor in this
				period, and his role in the 1832 Black Hawk Indian War temporarily placed him at the
				center of the unfolding tragedy in which American settlers removed Native Americans
				from their lands. Lincoln's subsequent legal career brings issues of law and society
				to the forefront, and his well-known political activities outline the rise and fall
				of the Second Party System, including the genesis and development of Whig and
				Democratic political cultures in this period. Much of Lincoln's political activities
				came to focus on the conflict over African-American slavery and, hence, race
				relations. Like many other Americans, Lincoln confronted the period's evangelical
				religion and made his peace with it. Like many other American men, our sixteenth
				president married, raised a family, and wrestled with the nineteenth century's
				rapidly changing gender roles.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The Lincoln/Net World Wide Web site's searchable databases and interpretive materials
				provide users with over thirty million words of searchable text, more than 3000
				images, and over 100 sound and 100 video files. In keeping with the idea of Abraham
				Lincoln as a lens through which users may examine and explore his context in
				antebellum society and politics, project staff members have added a wealth of
				materials created by, and describing, his contemporaries to the project's collection
				of Lincoln materials. Project users may explore texts including antebellum
				Illinoisans’ letters, diaries, and formal publications, stored in a database system,
				through the use of the PhiloLogic software suite. Developed by the University of
				Chicago’s ARTFL Project and the University of Chicago Libraries’ Electronic Text
				Services Division, PhiloLogic facilitates user searching by author, title, date, and
				genre, as well as familiar string searches. In addition, project users may explore
				subsets of texts corresponding in content with each of the project’s eight themes.
				Project staff members and workers have marked these texts up in a scheme compliant
				with TEI Lite that also uses customized Dublin Core headers to identify resources by
				the above categories. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Project image materials include maps, engravings, and early photographs, available
				through a MySQL database using the PHP scripting language. Project staff members and
				collaborators have also used digitized period song books to record performances of
				selected songs. These sound files are available in RealAudio format on the
				Lincoln/Net Web site. They present students and lifetime learners who find musical
				materials particularly instructive with a rich resource. They also provide an
				audience increasingly comprised of individuals familiar with, and expecting to find,
				online multimedia materials with the materials they seek. These song books also tell
				us something about Abraham Lincoln's context, and digital libraries' potential for
				illuminating the past. Historians of American society and politics have largely
				ignored nineteenth century song books as worthwhile source materials. But these
				publications played significant roles in each. Available in increasing numbers
				thanks to dramatic advances in printing technology, antebellum song books shaped
				many Americans' leisure time, time often spent today with radio, television, or
				video games. They also served as important levers for cultural work. Singing of
				course played a major role in religious services, as hymns placed religious doctrine
				in a participatory format contrasting with the Bible's text or a minister's spoken
				word. While a fair share of song books disseminated popular ditties, many others
				mirrored hymnals by setting powerful normative arguments to music. These included
				publications echoing the period's popular advice literature, such as the Young
				Lady's Songster, as well as song books devoted to temperance and other reform
				programs [<a class="ref" href="#songster1850">Young Lady's Songster 1850</a>]. Indeed, singing came to assume important
				roles in politics, both cultural and electoral, in the antebellum era. New
				technology provides an opportunity to recreate these important resources for today's
				audience.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">The Lincoln/Net site also features dynamic historical maps generated by Geographic
				Information Systems (GIS) technology. GIS maps provide project users with an
				opportunity to explore another type of historical resource: statistical data
				gathered by censuses or latter-day social scientists. At the same time that
				librarians and humanities scholars developed online digital libraries filled with
				searchable databases of texts, images, sound files, and video files, geographers and
				their collaborators in the world of systems analysts and computer programmers
				developed Geographic Information Systems. GIS provides an opportunity for its users
				to examine and analyze spatially-oriented materials in dynamic new ways. It manages
				and displays map information in a database environment that enables its users to
				submit queries, which in turn instruct the GIS software to create maps depicting
				only the types, or "layers," of information that the user has requested. For
				example, a GIS user may request a map of a region representing its railroad network,
				on a specific date, alone, without the clutter created by other types of
				information. That user might also ask GIS technology to render a map depicting the
				railroad network as well as results from the United States Census for a particular
				year, rendered to represent population density, for example. This map might
				facilitate preliminary research on the relationship between railroad development and
				economic development. The ability to isolate, depict, and overlay these layers of
				information makes GIS a formidable tool for the integration and analysis of a wide
				variety of data, and provides individual GIS users with a flexibility that
				facilitates inquiry and research. <a class="noteRef" href="#d29e233">[3]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">In the years immediately following its introduction in the early 1990s, GIS users
				employed stand-alone computer workstations to tap databases and generate dynamic map
				resources. This state of affairs largely restricted usage of the technology's
				dynamic data layering and map generation capacities to professional geographers,
				university professors and their students, and employees of well-funded business
				concerns and government agencies. But by the late 1990s GIS developers and vendors
				had adapted their technology for ready use on the World Wide Web in the form of
				products such as Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)'s ArcIMS. This
				development places Geographic Information Systems' considerable analytical power
				within the reach of a much larger audience, including, potentially, the users of
				online digital libraries. Much like digital libraries use metadata and full-text
				string searching to make text, image, sound, and video materials both accessible and

				Geographic Information Systems unlock the potential of spatially-oriented data. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">In addition to large, searchable databases of historical materials shedding light
				upon Abraham Lincoln and his context in society and politics during his
				pre-presidential years, the Lincoln/Net World Wide Web site features interpretive
				materials discussing Lincoln and these contexts. A brief, original Lincoln biography
				places local and national events in a temporal context. Original interpretive essays
				using episodes from Lincoln's life also present a public audience with an overview
				of the literature in each of eight fields: Frontier Settlement, Economic Development
				and Labor; Native American Relations; Law and Society; Political Development;
				African-Americans and White Americans' Racial Attitudes; Religion and Culture; and
				Women's Experience and Gender Roles. Lincoln/Net also features streaming video files
				in which leading historians discuss episodes in Lincoln's life as they relate to
				major themes in their scholarly publications.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Lincoln/Net’s interpretive materials, prepared by project staff members and other
				scholars, provide project users with an opportunity to locate primary source
				materials in what one scholar has called "webs of
				significance." Over thirty years ago the influential sociologist Clifford
				Geertz argued "that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he
						himself has spun. I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to
						be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an
						interpretive one in search of meaning" [<a class="ref" href="#geertz1973">Geertz 1973</a>, 5].<a class="noteRef" href="#d29e255">[4]</a> These webs run
				through and envelop the primary sources at several levels. In one sense, Lincoln and
				other individuals and groups in his era created webs with their discussions of their
				lives and surroundings. These webs emerge in the primary sources featured in the
				project databases. The traditions and discourses in which historians have analyzed
				and discussed these sources and what they may reveal represent webs of significance
				as well. In their work scholars have produced an interlocking and overlapping set of
				texts and spoken-word events, many referring to each other, that enable their
				audience to imagine the past in specific ways. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Historians' interpretive work situates historical actors and the materials that they
				created within these webs by emphasizing different portions of the historical record
				and explicating selected aspects of the actors’ experience. Individual works may
				analyze actions and events with special emphasis upon the social, or the cultural,
				or the political context in which they took place, and frame their argument and
				methodology through a discussion of works in this field. Scholars interested in
				different aspects of historical experience often find meaning in, and highlight,
				divergent portions of the source materials. For example, American historians who
				introduced a new focus on social history in the 1970s identified and worked with a
				very different set of source materials from their predecessors. The political,
				intellectual, and diplomatic historians who had dominated the discipline in previous
				decades largely drew upon state papers and the work of well-known intellectuals and
				policy-makers. The new generation of social historians dug into records, long
				considered largely insignificant, that shed light upon the lives of minorities,
				working people, and women. They also employed quantitative techniques drawing upon
				census returns and other statistics. By the 1990s another generation of scholars had
				begun to explore the connections between society and politics in light of the new
				social history. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">These structures provide World Wide Web users with a variety of interpretations of
				historical materials, and ask them to weigh the available evidence in order to
				assess their persuasive power. But these interpretive schemes need not be mutually
				exclusive. The Web enables librarians, historians, and other collaborators to
				present what Janet Murray has called "the kaleidoscopic canvas that can capture the world as it
						looks from many perspectives — complex and perhaps ultimately unknowable but
						still coherent" [<a class="ref" href="#murray1997">Murray 1997</a>, 162]. Online historical resources composed of digital library materials selected
				to illuminate specific aspects of historical experience, matched with historians'
				interpretations of these problems or themes, offer the possibility of fulfilling the
				new technologies' democratic promise by prompting World Wide Web users to become
				their own historians. Ayers’ student, colleague, and collaborator William G. Thomas,
				III places this goal at the center of digital historians’ agenda when he notes that
					"We…are trying to democratize history with our
				projects." As he puts it, "We want to give students and others access to the materials
                  	of the past, allowing them to engage in the process of doing history…" [<a class="ref" href="#thomas1999">Thomas 1999</a>]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">This democratizing initiative traces its roots back to at least two major movements
				in the historical profession. First, public historians, or those historians working
				outside of academia in museums, historic sites, or other public forums, argue that
				they seek to enable their patrons to think historically, to explore the complexity
				and contingency of change over time. In 1978 Robert Kelley, a leader in establishing
				the nation's first public history program at the University of California, Santa
				Barbara, argued that his students brought "the historical
				method" to the public [<a class="ref" href="#kelley1978">Kelley 1978</a>, 17]. Another public
				historian has argued that he and his colleagues can help laymen "learn to participate in the research process" [<a class="ref" href="#cole1994">Cole 1994</a>, 11]. At the very least, they share "the basic goal of
					encouraging people to think about the past for themselves" (<a href="#karamanski1990">Karamanski</a>, quoted in <a href="#cole1994">Cole 1994, 17</a>). Public historians' exhibits and programs have realized
				these goals in that they have brought selected primary source materials and
				artifacts, framed by scholars' interpretations in broad outline, to public audiences
					[<a class="ref" href="#cole1994">Cole 1994</a>, 17].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Second, historians concerned with classroom education have promoted an ideal of
				"active learning" using primary source materials. Deanne Shiroma has summarized this
				line of thinking by arguing that "As students work with primary sources, they have the
						opportunity to do more than just absorb information; they can also analyze,
						evaluate, recognize bias and contradiction, and weigh the significance of
						evidence presented by the source" [<a class="ref" href="#shiroma2000">Shiroma</a>, 1]. Randy Bass and Roy Rosenzweig add that "The analysis of primary sources, and the structured inquiry
						learning process that is often used in such examinations, are widely
						recognized as essential steps in building student interest in history and
						culture and helping them understand the ways that scholars engage in
						research, study, and interpretation" [<a class="ref" href="#bass1999">Bass and Rosenzweig 1999</a>, 29]. They go on to add that "virtually all versions of the
					national standards for social studies and history" call for the use of
				primary source materials in an active learning environment [<a class="ref" href="#bass1999">Bass and Rosenzweig 1999</a>, 29]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Digital materials built around librarians’ concept of access thrive in institutional
				settings like schools, colleges, and universities, where students can bring
				knowledge gained through classroom instruction and reading lists to bear in the
				crucial formulation of their queries. This intellectual capital, amplified through
				teachers' workshops and the other professional development events, greatly
				facilitates students’ becoming their own historians. But members of the general
				public using the World Wide Web for educational purposes, or "lifetime
					learners," usually encounter an online archive in far different
				circumstances, and with quite different needs, than student groups. Unlike enrolled
				students, these individuals and groups usually lack any recourse to instruction or
				other forms of historical expertise that may inform their exploration of a digital
				library. The more diligent and/or ambitious among them may find a wealth of
				stimulating materials on the Valley of the Shadow Project World Wide Web site, but
				they will largely rely upon their own interests, formed from personal experience, to
				guide their database queries. Some may employ historical training they received in
				high school or college classrooms. But many others will shy away, intimidated, from
				its mass of data. One reviewer of the Valley of the Shadow Project World Wide Web
				site noted that it fails "to outline conceptual frameworks through which a user might
						approach the archive" [<a class="ref" href="#brown2001">Brown 2001</a>, 210]. Another remarked that "To get much out of…the Web site…users must have a prior
						notion of what kind of information they are looking for" [<a class="ref" href="#kornblith2001">Kornblith 2001</a>]. As the historian Roy Rosenzweig has concluded, "While digital collections may put 'the
							novice in the archive', he or she is not so likely to know what
						to do there" [<a class="ref" href="#kornblith2001">Kornblith 2001</a>, 16].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Lincoln/Net’s interpretive resources provide Web users, and especially lifetime
				learners, with a new level of access to primary source materials, complementing the
					"freedom or ability to obtain or make use of" them.
				The Oxford English Dictionary suggests other aspects to the concept of
				accessibility. It defines "accessible" as "able
					to be (readily) understood or appreciated." In order to enable users
				outside the educational community to understand and appreciate their collected
				materials, Lincoln/Net furnishes its users with more than the opportunity to examine
				excellent digital reproductions of primary source materials, or even a metadata
				scheme reflecting the state of academic discourse. It also provides users with
				accounts and summaries of this discourse itself, laying out both the events that
				they discuss and scholars' various interpretations of them. A new generation of
				online historical resources, matching historians' ability to frame and pose
				historical questions and debates with digital libraries' new technologies, can make
				historical materials more fully accessible to the general public. Armed with these
				tools, members of the public can begin to "engage in the process

				believe that in the vast majority of cases this phenomenon will serve to buttress
				that authority by demonstrating historians' judicious use of the evidence. By
				injecting themselves into the rapidly widening historical forum that the World Wide
				Web represents, historians can win new significance in the formation of public
				historical consciousness, and contribute to the general public's ability to come to
				understandings of the past fashioned from their individual experience. These
				understandings will serve to bridge the gap between scholars' interpretations, long
				available only in monograph or article format, and the literate public. Developed
				from their own analysis of primary source materials and evaluations of scholars'
				interpretations, they may also provide individuals with the sense of meaning and

				primary sources alone, it also diverges from the vast majority of other World Wide
				Web sites providing historical interpretation. With the rise of the Web a new
				generation of online entrepreneurs rushed to furnish its users with a wide variety
				of online resources on which advertising might appear. As is the case in a number of
				other disciplines and subjects, these Web sites have become for many Americans a
				principal source of information. Today many students, lifelong learners, and other
				members of the public turn to the World Wide Web or, more specifically, the
				ubiquitous Google search engine, for a wide variety of data and interpretation.
				Recent research in library science shows that "Google, or similar web search engines, is the information
						finding tool of first choice for many users - far ahead of proprietary
						online services or libraries and light years ahead of print sources" [<a class="ref" href="#tenopir2004">Tenopir 2004</a>, 30]. One educator allowed that "Our librarians are fully aware that Google is our
						students', our faculty's, and sometimes our own first choice to find
						information…. Everyone starts with Google except librarians" [<a class="ref" href="#minkel2003">Minkel 2003</a>, 37]. Google provides its users with lists of Web materials in response to words,
				terms, or phrases that they have typed into its search interface, ranking these
				materials' potential usefulness principally by two criteria: their total number of
				users, and the number of times that other Web pages have provided links to them.
				World Wide Web sites that appear among Google's first responses to a simple, broad
				query appear there because they have received significant attention on the Web.

				travel to a library or archive, and often a single, specific library or archive, in
				order to examine these sources. Today, the World Wide Web's expanding reach provides
				many of these individuals with an opportunity to examine these materials at their
				leisure. But high quality digital library projects reflect only a portion of new

				These materials' rapid emergence online have truly made "everyman his own historian." Carl Becker imagined laymen thinking about

				discourse. Moving away from the work of the nineteenth century's more literary
				historians, professionalizing scholars increasingly devoted themselves to a new
				ethos emphasizing objectivity, research, and the expansion of knowledge. This
				orientation led historians to produce articles, monographs, and book reviews
				speaking almost exclusively to a limited audience of fellow professionals. In an era
				marked by rapid technological changes, increasing functional specialization, and the
				rise of large bureaucracies, historians devoted themselves to establishing a
				hierarchy of what one scholar has called "sound opinion" [<a class="ref" href="#haskell1977">Haskell 1977</a>, 239]. In the first half of the twentieth century, a period marked by considerable
				deference to experts, this approach gained historians considerable cultural
				authority. But in the postwar era Americans increasingly came to doubt and challenge
				their experts. A variety of factors, including the arrival of a generation of GI
				Bill students on college campuses and the United States' Cold War emphasis upon
				funding higher education, combined to convince historians that their disengagement
				from public discourse produced large rewards. But as politicians and taxpayers
				increasingly demanded that public universities educate more students with less state
				financial support, historians' isolation from the public became a liability. Today,

				argued, <blockquote><p>We no longer believe in a single reality, a single
						integrating view of the world, or even the reliability of a single angle of
						perception. Yet we retain the core human desire to fix reality on one
						canvas, to express all of what we see in an integrated and shapely manner. [<a class="ref" href="#murray1997">Murray 1997</a>, 161]</p></blockquote> Theoretical discussions of multiple perspectives can seem maddeningly
				abstract to members of the general public. But digital history resources focused on
				public figures like Lincoln, or similar topics, can furnish the public with a
				resource providing examples of divergent realities, as in the cases of different
				aspects of an individual’s experience, or conflicting descriptions of single events.
				But these multiple realities may remain largely invisible to the uninitiated person
				using digital libraries containing only primary source materials. Only historians'
				participation in digital library projects, and especially their presentation of
				materials analyzing and interpreting primary sources, can begin to unpack these
				multiple perceptions, realities, and histories for a public audience. These webs of
				significance can help members of the public to begin exploring primary source
				materials for themselves and, ultimately, relate them to their own experience and
				identity.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">If the Web represents an ideal environment for individuals' self-directed exploration
				of primary source materials, it also helps to facilitate historians' participation
				in the collaborative work necessary to produce these resources. Historians have
				benefited from the rise of digital libraries. Many have integrated large new sets of
				online primary resources into their teaching curricula. A farsighted few have
				explored new technologies' impact upon historical scholarship. But, to date, most
				academic historians have largely ignored these technologies' implications for their
				own roles in public life. In doing so, they have failed the American public. They
				have also failed their own self-interest. Academic historians can use the rapid
				technological changes that are shaping our society to demonstrate how their
				scholarship and debates relate to the general public and encourage critical thought
				- in other words, demonstrate their value to society. If they do not, they may soon
				confront significant portions of the American public relying on amateurs'
				undocumented online historical materials. They may also find themselves increasingly
				marginalized in their own universities and colleges as faculty members' ability to
				attract outside grant funding becomes an ever larger part of academic life. Finally,
				they may find themselves increasingly vulnerable to state officials' attempts to use
				new technologies, in the form of distance learning, to push scholars and critical
				thought farther to the margins in the world of higher education. A new, more
				democratic history is a part of historians' future, like it or not. Today they face
				the question: will they add their voices to this discussion? </div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d29e124"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>Ayers was among the first historians to explore this promise. With the
					help of Anne Rubin, William G. Thomas, and a team of lucky graduate students,

					than a less focused digital library. It also invited comparisons between
