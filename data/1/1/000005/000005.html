        appeal of humanities computing have invoked the example of the Oulipo. Although there are
        similarities between the activities of the Oulipo and the new approach to computer-assisted

        the Oulipo, potential text analysis is less a question of interpreting literature than of
        supplying algorithms for the good use one can make of reading. Producing exemplary
        interpretations with algorithms is a secondary consideration. Oulipian constraints are
        better understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use with some
        objective in mind. The procedures for making sense of texts provide for their own
        interpretation: they are not only instruments for discovering meaning but also reflections
        on making meaning.</p></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Researchers in the humanities who focus their efforts on the use of computer technology to
      engage texts have wrestled with the relevance of their work. Within the field of humanities
      computing, scholars have used information technology to analyze single texts as well as large
      corpora in search of patterns that would be difficult to detect without the use of machines.
      Despite the ability of computers to organize and process massive amounts of textual data, the
      broader community of literary scholars has not readily accepted the potential of digital
      technology in humanities research. In 1993, Mark Olsen argued that scholars using computers to
      analyze texts tended to focus on quantifying a literary effect instead of exploring how texts
      are meaningful in broader historical and cultural contexts [<a class="ref" href="#olsen1993">Olsen 1993</a>]. Recent
      efforts to reconceptualize text analysis with computers have emphasized hypothesis testing and
      the search for elusive patterns that may provide insight into interpreting texts. In order to
      broaden the appeal of this new direction in humanities computing, advocates have invoked the
      example of the Oulipo, a group of writers in France that invent "potential"
      ways to create literature using rigorous formal constraints. The idea that computers can lend
      themselves to formal methods of subjective textual study (thereby assuaging concerns that
      computers will make reading literature a soulless process of crunching numbers) is expressed
      forcefully by Jerome McGann in his book <cite class="title italic">Radiant Textuality</cite>. For
      McGann, the Oulipo set an example of what can be done with combinatorial methods to realize
      Alfred Jarry's program of pataphysics as a "science of exceptions" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2001">#mcgann2001</a></span>. Rejecting the practice of using computers as tools for objective, empirical research,
      Stephen Ramsay envisions an algorithmic criticism that transforms texts "for the purpose of releasing what the Oulipians would call their
            'potentialities'" [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2003">Ramsay 2003</a>, 172]. Stéfan Sinclair has developed HyperPo as a web-based tool for helping scholars read
      and play with texts using procedures inspired by the Oulipo <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sinclair2003">#sinclair2003</a></span>. The
      idea of playing with texts using computers is pursued further by Geoffrey Rockwell who calls
      for the creation of web-based playpens where scholars can experiment with tools and discover
      new ways to formulate and test hypotheses about what texts mean [<a class="ref" href="#rockwell2003">Rockwell 2003</a>].</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Although there are similarities between the activities of the Oulipo and the new approach to
      computer-assisted literary analysis, the development of tools for the express purpose of
      encouraging scholars to play with texts does not follow the model of Oulipian research into
      potentialities. For the Oulipo, the invention of procedures for playing with texts is its own
      end, an intellectual activity that invites application but does not require adoption by others
      as an indication of success. According to Raymond Queneau, one of the founding members of the
      Oulipo, "The word 'potential' concerns the very nature of
          literature; that is, fundamentally it's less a question of literature strictly speaking
          than of supplying forms for the good use one can make of literature. We call potential
          literature the search for new forms and structures that may be used by writers in any way
          they see fit" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#motte1986a">#motte1986a</a></span>. Queneau makes it clear that what the Oulipo does relates to but does not constitute
      literary creation. Writing is a derivative activity: the Oulipo pursue what we might call
      speculative or theoretical literature and leave the application of the constraints to
      practitioners who may (or may not) find their procedures useful. According to François Le
      Lionnais, another founding member, a method for writing literature need not produce an actual
      text: "method is sufficient in and of itself. There are methods without
          textual examples. An example is an additional pleasure for the author and the reader" [<a class="ref" href="#bens1980">Bens 1980</a>, 88]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The Oulipo did not articulate a clear statement explaining potential methods for reading
      literature, but we can extrapolate a definition from how they described their efforts to
      invent methods for writing literature. <em class="emph">Potential text analysis is less a question of
        interpreting literature than of supplying algorithms for the good use one can make of
        reading. Producing exemplary interpretations with algorithms is a secondary
      consideration.</em> It follows that the interpretation of texts using a computer should not
      be in and of itself the objective of potential text analysis. The objective should be the
      invention of algorithms that scholars may (or may not) use, according to their own interests.
      The potentiality of computers as tools for text analysis implies that scholars engaged in the
      derivative activity of interpreting literature may not find such methods useful.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">By inventing procedures for generating texts, the Oulipo separated the formal aspects of
      writing from its content so that procedures for making texts could be carried out
      independently of those who invent the procedures. As the Oulipo declared in a presentation of
      its work to the Collège de 'Pataphysique, this is a new era in the history of literature: "Thus, the time of <em class="emph">created creations</em>, which was that of the
          literary works we know, should cede to the era of <em class="emph">creating creations</em>, capable
          of developing from themselves and beyond themselves, in a manner at once predictable and
          inexhaustibly unforeseen" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#motte1986a">#motte1986a</a></span>. The transition from <em class="emph">created creations</em> to <em class="emph">creating creations</em>
      divides the traditional author function into what Christelle Reggiani identifies as the
      biphasic Oulipian functions of the inventor and the poet [<a class="ref" href="#reggiani1999">Reggiani 1999</a>, 110]. The first phase involves an inventor who devises constraints that will guide the
      production of a text. The inventor does not worry about what the constraints will produce: he
      seeks consistency and robustness in formal procedures. During the second phase, a poet applies
      the constraints in a particular instance and produces a text. Clearly the role of the inventor
      is privileged over the poet. Whereas the poet can only follow the rules of literary form and
      assemble a finite number of texts, the inventor explores potential forms which can generate
      innumerable texts.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">When the Oulipo formed in 1960, one of the first things they discussed was using computers to
      read and write literature. They communicated regularly with Dmitri Starynkevitch, a computer
      programmer who helped develop the IBM SEA CAB 500 computer. The relatively small size and low
      cost of the SEA CAB 500 along with its high-level programming language PAF (Programmation
      Automatique des Formules) provided the Oulipo with a precursor to the personal computer [<a class="ref" href="#starynkevitch1990">Starynkevitch 1990</a>]. Starynkevitch used the machine to create an imaginary
      telephone directory composed of realistic names and numbers generated by his computer: <div class="example"><div class="ptext"><ul class="list simple"><li class="item">Tab Philippe, 14, rue de La Machine normande</li><li class="item">Dubit Anatole, 20, av. du Moine Romain</li><li class="item">Pouguinf Jules, 45, rue de la Maison</li><li class="item">Herebier Adolphe, 38, rue des Maisons Jolies</li><li class="item">Lir Yves, 64, rue Saint-Pierre</li><li class="item">Lorbont Edouard, 21, av. du Buisson Gai</li><li class="item">Sech André, 18, rue des Montagnes riveraines</li><li class="item">Dreber Gilbert, 5, rue Jules Marcel</li><li class="item">Micier Michel, 54, rue Saint Augustin</li><li class="item">Debate Robert, 25, rue des Montagnes</li><li class="item">Locrobelier Adolphe, 18, av. des Gares étroites</li><li class="item">Rexer Augustin, 1, rue de la Tour blonde</li><li class="item">Quimier Anatole, 20, rue du Buisson galant</li></ul></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Example 1. </div>Computer-generated names and addresses from Starynkevitch's telephone directory</div></div> The algorithms Starynkevitch used were based mainly on random number generators.
      Given names and street names were selected from a predetermined list. Surnames were composed
      from sets of letter sequences that alternated between open and closed syllables [<a class="ref" href="#bens1980">Bens 1980</a>, 162–163]. The Oulipo was impressed with the mock phone book but
      Queneau did not believe the computer application had "potential".
      Le Lionnais found the phone book interesting because it was not particularly interesting: it
      was neither bizarre nor funny, and it looked like a real phone book. What worried the Oulipo was
      the aleatory nature of computer-assisted artistic creation: they sought to avoid chance and
      automatisms over which the computer user had no control [<a class="ref" href="#bens1980">Bens 1980</a>, 157–8]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">In 1981 the Oulipo published <cite class="title italic">Atlas de littérature potential</cite>
      where they described some of the computer applications they had devised for reading
      literature. Their early experiments included machine-assisted readings of Queneau's <cite class="title italic">Cent mille milliards de poèmes</cite>. In this deceptively small book,
      Queneau had composed ten sonnets in such a way that the reader could select the first line of
      any sonnet, the second line of any sonnet, etc., and generate one of 10<span class="hi superscript">14</span> possible sonnets. The book itself contains the mechanism for generating poems: each
      line is printed on a strip of paper, and the reader can select strips from the original
      sonnets to generate a potential sonnet [<a class="ref" href="#queneau1961">Queneau 1961</a>]. Dimitri Starynkevitch had
      programmed his SEA CAB 500 machine to compose sonnets from Queneau's <cite class="title italic">Cent
        mille milliards de poèmes</cite>. In 1975 the Atelier de Recherches et Techniques Avancées,
      or ARTA, wrote a computer program that produced instantiations of the <cite class="title italic">Cent mille milliards de poèmes</cite> as a function of a user's name and the time it took
      him or her to type it. It is not difficult to simulate ARTA's computer program to produce
      poems from Queneau's original text by counting the number of seconds it takes a user to type
      his or her name and using that information to calculate a "magic number":
        <div id="fig1" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000005/resources/images/image1.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000005/resources/images/image1.png" alt="Screenshot of command-line program running in a terminal"/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div>A simulation of ARTA's program for generating poems from Queneau's <cite class="title italic">Cent Mille Milliards de Poèmes</cite>.

          lines from the original 10 sonnets to reproduce any of the 100,000,000,000,000 potential
          poems) it reads as follows: <blockquote><div class="lg"><div class="l">The pampas king betrays his devotees</div><div class="l">and decks the bulls that roam the paramo</div><div class="l">the native driver's waiting in the breeze</div><div class="l">the re in in [sic] all his songs came out as doh</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">You'll view so plain a plain with trembling knees</div><div class="l">as castles blaze and palaces burn low</div><div class="l">for death casts piles of shit on pedigrees</div><div class="l">it's scary both for hick and aristo</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">The impassioned poet isn't polyglot</div><div class="l">one language in his brain that's all he's got</div><div class="l">shame gives the colonel's brow a greasy sheen</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">All's sold the prawns the lobsters our whole stock</div><div class="l">say sorry that no whales came back to dock</div><div class="l">unless the bell is silent and serene</div></div></blockquote></div></div> Each digit in the magic number corresponds to a verse from one of the original ten
      sonnets. The program's algorithm provides a certain degree of interaction between the user and
      the machine, and the results of running the program are theoretically reproducible if a user
      types the same name in the same amount of time. The algorithm therefore has potential, but
      only insofar that it accelerates the production of poems. It may be easier and more
      entertaining to generate poems automatically without relying on user input, and there are
      several web sites on the Internet that do this. One could even use a random number function:
        <div id="fig2" class="figure"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000005/resources/images/image2.png" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/1/000005/resources/images/image2.png" alt="Screenshot of command-line program running in a terminal"/></a><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>A program for generating poems from Queneau's <cite class="title italic">Cent Mille

      aleatory effects. The original algorithm preserves an active role for the user, even if that
      role requires the minimal engagement of typing one's name in order to sustain the creative
      process.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Paul Braffort and Jacques Roubaud, two Oulipians with backgrounds in mathematics and computer
      science, formed the Atelier de Littérature Assistée par la Mathématique et les Ordinateurs
      (ALAMO) in 1980 to explore computer-assisted writing. Following the model of Queneau's <cite class="title italic">Cent mille milliards de poèmes</cite>, the ALAMO wrote computer programs to
      produce texts according to the rules of various genres, such as poems and aphorisms. Braffort
      explained that combinatorial methods for generating texts with computers fall into two
      categories. The first category, applicational methods, involves templates for arranging words
      according to their grammatical function. One particularly amusing application generates what

      verses are recombined according to a set of well-defined rules. Poetic forms can thus be
      understood as algorithms for creating meaning with language.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3056e408">[1]</a> The ALAMO devised ways to formalize poetics in
      order for a computer to generate structured texts which may or may not make sense. The actual
      poems produced by the programs are derivatives of the way computers can be harnessed to
      explore language. Reading these computer-generated texts can be amusing because of unexpected
      or incongruous combinations of words that oddly make sense. Despite their uncanny effects,
      however, texts produced through applicational methods still bear the mark of the inventor who
      not only determines the templates into which syntagma are inserted but also the stock of words
      and phrases from which the computer program draws.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The second category, implicational methods, involves further abstraction of structures.
      Instead of creating templates for arranging words according to predetermined syntactic and
      semantic categories, the inventor devises rules for making templates. According to Braffort, "implicational methods take a further step [in the direction of
          invention]. The very logic of the text is controlled by the program: a global syntagma
          comes into play and becomes manifest as a supervisor of local syntagmas" [<a class="ref" href="#braffort1984">Braffort 1984</a>, 18]. The logic of implicational methods relies on recursion in programs that generate
      texts, allowing for systematic processing of linguistic elements below the level of the
        "master" program. With recursion, computer programs can continuously refine
      their output in ways the inventor would not be able to easily predict. Implicational methods
      provide computers with a small measure of independence. Braffort and the other members of the
      ALAMO developed a number of formal systems for expressing the relationships between linguistic
      elements in literary texts. One of these systems, FASTL (Formalismes pour l'Analyse et la
      Synthèse de Textes Littéraires), used recursion and iteration to encompass all forms of
      written communication. It is no accident that, with Braffort a computer scientist and Roubaud
      a mathematician, FASTL resembles abstract systems of representation used in the sciences: "USFAL ['Un Système Formel pour l'Algorithmique
          Linguistique', a precursor to FASTL] will be for theoretical literature what
          mathematical disciplines such as the theory of differential equations can be for physics,
          economics, etc." <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#oulipo1981">#oulipo1981</a></span>. An important feature of FASTL is its scalability in representing textual elements.
      Text objects are organized within a hierarchy that extends from the characters on a page or
      screen to entire libraries or corpora. Expressions for representing relationships between
      objects at one level of the hierarchy should be applicable to relationships of objects at
      another level within the hierarchy. Algorithms for analyzing texts can potentially operate
      recursively: <blockquote><p> For the mind of a mathematician, we will say that the algorithm is a
            <em class="emph">function</em> that, when applied to [a given text] considered as its
            <em class="emph">argument</em> provides a <em class="emph">result</em>. This result is itself a text, but
          a text with a complex organization that is highly structured with fragments of symbolic
          texts and readings [...]  (<span class="error"><a href="#oulipo1981">Oulipo 1981, 133, author's emphasis.</a></span>)</p></blockquote> Given the scalability of FASTL and the possibility of recursion, abstract
      representations of texts within FASTL could potentially undergo further processing and
      abstraction. The complexity of texts as hierarchically structured objects, however, makes
      devising an algorithm that operates from the level of the word to that of the sentence,
      paragraph and chapter extremely difficult. Nevertheless, the ALAMO's research into
      computer-assisted text analysis envisioned the possibility of computational <span class="foreign i">mise en
        abîme</span> where the results of analysis can repeatedly feed as textual arguments into
      algorithmic functions in a theoretically never-ending process. The Oulipo anticipated the
      potentiality of recursion early in its history: in a report submitted to the Collège de
      Pataphysique (an institution dedicated to the pursuit of the "the science of
      exceptions"), the group proclaimed that computers would make possible the <blockquote><p> abstracting [of] commonplaces from the structures of commonplaces—and
          then a "squared" topology of these places, and so forth until one attains,
          in a rigorous analysis of this <span class="foreign i">regressus</span> itself, the absolute, the
          Absolute "whose armature," according to Jarry, "is made of clichés." <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#motte1986a">#motte1986a</a></span></p></blockquote> The efforts of the ALAMO to develop computer applications that generate texts through
      recursion have met limited success, however <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#braffortsd">#braffortsd</a></span>.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">As Braffort himself recognized, implicational methods for writing texts with machines are
      related to research in artificial intelligence. The Oulipo does not seek to replace the human
      writer who is at the center of the Oulipian enterprise. The group's approach to automating
      potential literature follows the Cartesian method of dividing a complicated question (how does
      writing occur?) into smaller questions that are easier to solve. Recursion is one technique
      that could allow humans to pursue new forms of writing by handing off some of the work to
      machines. But where is the limit to recursion? In 1963 Jacques Duchateau argued that what
      interests the the Oulipo most in machines is their capacity for organizing information: <blockquote><p>organized means that data will be processed, that all the possibilities
          of the data will be examined systematically according to a model that will be furnished
          eventually by man or another machine, the model of which will also be furnished by a third
          machine, the model of which, etc.  (<a href="#bens1980">in Bens 1980, 251</a>)</p></blockquote> Duchateau attempts to allay fears of an unintended determinism resulting from the
      aleatory effects of rigorous textual constraints, but his notion of organization does not make
      any distinction between humans and machines as information processing units. His definition of
      organization is recursive: it holds that a machine processes information according to a model
      based on another machine, which in turn processes information according to the model of
      another machine, etc. We might be tempted to think that for the Oulipo, humans are the first
      machines after which all other machines are modeled, but Duchateau's definition places humans
      and machines on the same ontological footing. Ultimately there is no central processing unit
      which controls all the subprocesses. The Oulipian inventor may create blueprints for
      literature, but he distances himself from the work of applying rules and crafting texts.
      Despite his privileged isolation from the particularities of writing, the inventor is just
      another process that communicates with other processes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">If, as Duchateau explains it, the process of writing literature with machines consists of
      organizing information in new ways to analyze and synthesize texts, traditional authorship
      will eventually give way to a set of increasingly anonymous and autonomous processes. During
      one of its reunions in the early 1960s the Oulipo anticipated the risk of automatism in the
      structures they were defining. The group attempted to make room for individual freedom but
      they were unable to reconcile freedom with automatism. Jacques Bens recognized that every
      structure automatized writing to a certain extent, and Claude Berge added that potential
      literature generated new automatisms [<a class="ref" href="#bens1980">Bens 1980</a>, 144]. Le Lionnais insisted
      that a sufficiently complex system of constraints offered writers a number of options from
      which they could choose. The Oulipians wanted to avoid the unconscious automatisms of the
      Surrealists, but the conscious use of structures in their writing produced what they could not
      avoid describing as "automatic". Le Lionnais admitted that "it is true that the birth of machines has modified the current sense of
          the word 'automatic'" [<a class="ref" href="#bens1980">Bens 1980</a>, 185]. The Oulipo recognized that the problem of using computers to create texts stemmed from
      the writer's inability to remain aware of how the machine applied constraints. In the 1970s
      the Oulipo introduced the notion of the clinamen, which helped to resolve this dilemma. Based
      on a conception of the movement of atoms in Lucretius' <cite class="title italic">On the Nature of
        Things</cite>, the clinamen is the primordial anti-constraint: it makes creation possible
      by introducing chance and spontaneity in an ordered universe <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#motte1986b">#motte1986b</a></span>. The
      Oulipo recovered a sense of the unexpected in the constraints they used but they wanted to
      define and control how chance would play in their writing. An algorithm is productive as a
      tool for engaging texts as long as the user can follow how the algorithm works and anticipate
      the effects of chance. If the computational system becomes too complex or too unpredictable,
      the act of interpretation will depend on opaque sequences of data processing of which the user
      must remain unconscious.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The Oulipians developed at least two algorithms for reading texts. The first is Harry

      instance of a bi-word. Dmitri Khmelev and Fiona Tweedie have developed a technique for
      determining authorship using Markov chains and transition matrices for the sequence of letters
      in a text. Their technique can also be used with formatives, signifiers, bi-words and
      punctuation. Given a text of which the author is one of a group of known authors in a corpus,
      we can determine the probability that the text in question was written by each of the known
      authors. I have used this technique with a corpus of 1569 texts written by 290 authors from
      the ARTFL database (<a class="ref" href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/artfl/" onclick="window.open('http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/artfl/'); return false">http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ARTFL/</a>). I first selected randomly a text from
      each author in the corpus. Of the 290 randomly selected texts, 186 were correctly attributed
      to the authors who wrote them, or 64 percent. According to Khmelev and Tweedie, this
      represents an error rate of 0.153 percent. I then performed a cross-validation of the ARTFL
      corpus where 557 texts were correctly classified by author. These results are similar to those
      of Khmelev and Tweedie, suggesting that the combination of matrix analysis and Markov chains
      offers an interesting technique for measuring "linguistically
      microscopic" data to determine the authorship of texts written in French [<a class="ref" href="#khmelev2001">Khmelev and Tweedie 2001</a>, 302–4]. <a class="noteRef" href="#d3056e1069">[4]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Whatever the promise of matrix analysis in providing quantitative evidence for measuring an

      matrices without basing his analyses on written texts. He and the other members of the Oulipo

      author's style, and we could consider it as an interesting example of Anoulipism, or the
      discovery of potentialities in existing texts. The Oulipo believed, however, that
      Synthoulipism, or the invention of potentialities for future texts, was its "essential vocation" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#motte1986a">#motte1986a</a></span>. The combinatorics of non-linear, two-dimensional poems invite the development of
      computer applications for generating and analyzing a new kind of text. Whether anyone will go
      to the trouble to write and read matrix poems is a question the Oulipo has not pursued, in
      part perhaps because it would involve realizing concrete techiques and practices that would no
      longer be potential.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Mathews and Queneau offer two algorithms for creating meaning with language that demonstrate
      the Oulipo's efforts to imagine potentialities for literature, "if need be through recourse to machines that process information" <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#motte1986a">#motte1986a</a></span>. We can operationalize these algorithms with computers for literary analysis "if need be", but the interest of the algorithms lies not in what they
      help us see in a given text but in the way they invite us to play rigorously for play's sake.
      Recent efforts to reconceptualize text analysis with computers have tried to imagine how
      computers can be used as tools for discovering new ways to make sense of texts. The Oulipo
      proposes something more radical: to borrow a turn of phrase from Jerome McGann, the invention
      of algorithms can create potentialities for imagining what we do not know about textuality in
      general. Given a rigorous constraint on the use of language, what does the constraint itself
      do? Does it offer new possibilities for meaning? If so, how? Oulipian constraints are better
      understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use with some objective in
      mind. The procedures for making sense of texts are meaningful in and of themselves. They are
      not only instruments for discovering meaning but also reflections on making meaning. The
      distinction I have made between writing and reading follows what the Oulipo has and has not
      articulated in the theory of its practice. In the end, the need for a distinction becomes
      unnecessary when one observes that all encounters with textuality invite the application of
      rules that lead the writer and the reader to see unanticipated potentialities in language.
      Humanities computing should make room for playing with tools without concern for specific
      output and outcomes. In doing so, it will open itself to new theoretical possibilities of
      textuality, creating opportunities for what we could call "pure" research that
      may (or may not) draw interest from the broader humanities community.</div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d3056e408"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>Jerome McGann observes that
