			Humanities Quarterly</cite>, called "Issues in Humanities
				Computing", is one end of a road that began forty-five years ago in the old
			Reading Room of the British Museum. (The other end of that road is the <cite class="title italic">Encyclopedia of Humanities and Social Science Computing</cite>, which
			I am organizing with Vernon Burton under the auspices of the National Center for
			Supercomputer Applications at the University of Illinois and scheduled to be published
			by Idea Group in 2008.) My immediate impetus to consider computers as a means of solving
			a scholarly problem was the difficulty I experienced in locating the significant echoes
			of Milton’s <cite class="title italic">Paradise Lost</cite> that Shelley had embedded in his
			<cite class="title italic">Prometheus Unbound</cite> in order to enhance its resonance as
			a master statement of poetic truth. Once back at Queens College, the quest for
			assistance from computers led to the IBM Watson Laboratories in Yorktown Heights, New
			York, where the language group, relieved of responsibility for creating machine
			translation but not formally dismissed, created for me a crude mechanism for locating
			some of those echoes.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">That initial effort was reported in September 1964 at what was probably the first
			conference on computers and humanities research, the so-called Literary Data Processing
			Conference organized by Harry Arader of IBM and chaired by Stephen M. Parrish of Cornell
			and Jess B. Bessinger of NYU. Among the other speakers, Roberto Busa expatiated on the
			problems of managing 15 million words for his magnum opus on Thomas Aquinas. Parrish and
			Bessinger, along with the majority of other speakers, reported on their efforts to
			generate concordances with the primitive data processing machines available at that
			time. In light of the current number of projects to digitize literary works it is ironic
			to recall Martin Kay’s plea to the audience not to abandon their punch cards and
			magnetic tapes after their concordances were printed and (hopefully) published.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">My discovery of the number of scholars from around the country who were engaged to some
			extent in using computers for humanistic research inspired the thought that we should
			keep in touch with one another, and after two years I persuaded IBM to fund what at
			first I called <cite class="title italic">Computers and the Humanities: A Newsletter</cite>.
			Even after original articles started to come in and this publication was exalted to the
			status of a scholarly journal, it maintained as a primary function the exchange of
			information in this new and perilous environment. I have been told that our biennial
			"Directory of Scholars Active", later compiled into a
			book published by Pergamon Press, helped many recent initiates into humanities computing
			to find their footing and locate collaborators. Even more satisfying was the knowledge
			that several young assistant professors, coming up for tenure, succeeded in retaining
			their grip on an academic career by publishing in the pages of CHum. An offprint on the
			chairman’s desk or the dean’s, looking as dignified as one from any of the older
			established journals, reportedly had the weight to outbalance the strangeness of the
			activity that had attracted these young persons.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">By 1975, Bob Dilligan of the University of Southern California, co-editor of a Keats
			concordance, offered to organize a conference as a sequel to one held two years
			previously at the University of Minnesota, and being there on sabbatical, I helped with
			that effort. That involvement led, in turn to my participating in the organization of
			similar conferences at Dartmouth and Rutgers. Sensing a need to broaden our view of
			humanities computing and recognizing the growth of databases as a resource in their own
			right (rather than as simply the raw material of concordances), I began a series of
			International Conferences on Data Bases in the Humanities and Social Sciences at
			Darmouth, Grinnell and Auburn at Montgomery. The growing number of attendees at these
			conferences seemed to require a permanent organization to sponsor them, and in 1978 I
			convened the session at the annual MLA meeting that created the Association for
			Computers and the Humanities. After two years as president, I turned that operation over
			to Mary Dee Harris and then Nancy Ide, so that younger people could gain whatever
			academic credit they could through that position and so that the operation would have an
			independent stature.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">When New York suffered its financial crisis in 1974, and it was no longer possible to
			publish under the aegis of Queens College, I entrusted the journal to two commercial
			publishers, neither of which saw much importance in either humanities or humanities
			computing and treated this publication with consequent lack of concern. In 1984,
			therefore, I took early retirement and set up my own small publishing operation in
			Sarasota, Florida. I was thus able to publish several collections of essays on databases
			in the humanities and social sciences and to start up two new journals, <cite class="title italic">Computers and the Social Sciences</cite> (later combined with the
			<cite class="title italic">Social Science Computing Record</cite>) and <cite class="title italic">Computers and Translation</cite> (renamed <cite class="title italic">Machine Translation</cite> and published now by Springer). Like so many small
			businesses, this one proved less than financially viable, and by 1987, I had sold off
			the various titles and returned to my more congenial academic environment.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">In this situation I am now able to concentrate on the encyclopedia project and the
			“op-ed” page of DHQ. It is our hope that this feature will provide a forum for
			discussion of the larger issues that confront us as we continue our effort to bring
			computer technology up to what we consider its proper status in academe and scholarly
			activity. The initial offering is my own take on the problem of achieving the same
			respect for online publishing that is held now by print. My hope is to set a tone of
			serious reflection that will be adopted by those who submit future contributions to this
			section of the journal.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Rather than brief comments, we are hoping for thought-out and substantially developed
			opinions on all the aspects of our developing discipline. Responses to these discussions
			are equally welcome and will be tagged to establish a continuous flow along evolving
			threads. Of course, publication will depend on the approval of the Editorial Board. A
			few possible topics are suggested below, but we hope these will prompt contributions on
			a much wider range of issues and questions.</div><div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Can software development, rather than conventional research, serve as a step up
				the promotion ladder?</li><li class="item">Are there better ways to organize our information than the current search programs
				provide?</li><li class="item">How do we confront the trend toward English as a universal scholarly language in
				the face of objections, such as those from France? How far need we go in
				accommodating other world languages—Spanish, Russian, Chinese?</li><li class="item">How concerned should we be about the consequence of Web accessibility undermining
				the status of major research centers in or near metropolitan cities?</li><li class="item">Has the availability of the Internet as a scholarly medium enhanced the academic
				status of women and minorities?</li><li class="item">Will humanists’ dependence on computer-generated data lead to a scientistic search
				for objective and reproducible results?</li><li class="item">Can we learn anything about today’s resistance to new technologies from studying
				the reactions in the Renaissance to the introduction of printing?</li><li class="item">Will digital libraries make today’s libraries obsolete?</li><li class="item">Are the concepts and development of artificial intelligence relevant to humanistic
				scholarship?</li></ul></div></div><div class="toolbar"><a href="../index.html">2007 1.1</a>
