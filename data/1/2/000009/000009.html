				game "Colossal Cave Adventure", academic and popular
				references to it frequently perpetuate inaccuracies. "Adventure" was the first in a series of text-based games
					("interactive fiction") that emphasize exploring, puzzles, and
				story, typically in a fantasy setting; these games had a significant cultural impact
				in the late 1970s and a significant commercial presence in the early 1980s. Will
				Crowther based his program on a real cave in Kentucky; Don Woods expanded this
				version significantly. The expanded work has been examined as an occasion for
				narrative encounters [<a class="ref" href="#buckles1985">Buckles 1985</a>] and as an aesthetic masterpiece of
				logic and utility [<a class="ref" href="#knuth1998">Knuth 1998</a>]; however, previous attempts to assess
				the significance of "Adventure" remain incomplete without
				access to Crowther's original source code and Crowther's original source cave.
				Accordingly, this paper analyzes previously unpublished files recovered from a
				backup of Woods's student account at Stanford, and documents an excursion to the
				real Colossal Cave in Kentucky in 2005. In addition, new interviews with Crowther,
				Woods, and their associates (particularly members of Crowther's family) provide new
				insights on the precise nature of Woods's significant contributions. Real locations
				in the cave and several artifacts (such as an iron rod and an axe head) correspond
				to their representation in Crowther's version; however, by May of 1977, Woods had
				expanded the game to include numerous locations that he invented, along with
				significant technical innovations (such as scorekeeping and a player inventory).
				Sources that incorrectly date Crowther's original to 1972 or 1974, or that identify
				it as a cartographic data file with no game or fantasy elements, are sourced thinly
				if at all. The new evidence establishes that Crowther wrote the game during the
				1975-76 academic year and probably abandoned it in early 1976. The original game
				employed magic, humor, simple combat, and basic puzzles, all of which Woods greatly
				expanded. While Crowther remained largely faithful to the geography of the real
				cave, his original did introduce subtle changes to the environment in order to
				improve the gameplay.</p></div><div id="section01" class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Will Crowther's "Colossal Cave Adventure" was neither the
				first computer game nor the first program to emulate conversation<a class="noteRef" href="#d1403e113">[1]</a>; nevertheless, "Adventure" — an interactive
				textual simulation of a caving expedition, augmented by fantasy-themed puzzles –
				inspired a generation of hackers. Playing "Adventure"
				involves reading prose descriptions of the setting, and typing brief commands (i.e.
					"light lamp") in order to solve puzzles and collect
				treasure. Similar text games representing environments defined both by story and
				rules were extremely popular during the 80s and (with the addition of graphics)
				through the 90s. Text-adventures, also known as "interactive fiction"
					(IF),<a class="noteRef" href="#d1403e143">[2]</a> attracted modest scholarly attention as an emerging
				literary form in the 80s;<a class="noteRef" href="#d1403e171">[3]</a> yet "[m]ost commentators and critics of the adventure game
						genre… fail to mention the original <cite class="title italic">Adventure</cite>
						at all, and those who do usually date it far off the mark… and often neglect
						to mention its creators" [<a class="ref" href="#aarseth1997">Aarseth 1997</a>, 107]. The resulting vacuum has attracted memes, some so firmly lodged in our
				inventory of digital lore that they regularly appear without citation. In order to
				map out the groundwork for a more accurate assessment of "Adventure", its innovations, and its legacy, this study draws on two
				crucial resources previously unexamined by digital scholars: Crowther’s original
				source code and Kentucky’s original source cave.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Levy observes that "like any significant program, Adventure was expressive of
						the personality and environment of the authors" [<a class="ref" href="#levy1984">Levy 1984</a>, 133]. Due to Crowther's personal choice to keep a low profile,<a class="noteRef" href="#d1403e201">[4]</a>
				analysis of "Adventure"<a class="noteRef" href="#d1403e211">[5]</a> must
				rely more heavily on the environment — both professional and natural. We know
				Crowther's coding environment was collaborative and highly technical,<a class="noteRef" href="#d1403e217">[6]</a>
				but so far we have only known Crowther's "Adventure"
				indirectly, through a version greatly expanded by Don Woods. <a href="#section02">Section 2</a> of this article is a formal examination of
				Crowther's original source code files, offering, for the first time, a clear
				understanding of Crowther's innovative blend of simulation and fantasy, as well as a
				better appreciation of the creative contributions of Woods. <a href="#section03">Section 3</a> compares the game to maps of the cave site, presents
				photographs of an excursion to Colossal Cave, and offers testimony from experienced
				cavers. These key sources — the code and the cave, analyzed here for the first time
				– establish that Crowther's original was not only faithful to the geography of the
				real Colossal Cave, but was also a fantasy remediation of that site. <a href="#section04">Section 4</a> offers a revision of the "Adventure" timeline in an attempt to correct common
				misconceptions and encourage further scholarship, and a brief <a href="#section05">conclusion</a> compiles the major formalist observations,
				as a gesture towards encouraging further research.</div><div class="div div1"><h2 class="head">Taking Inventory of "Adventure"</h2><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">While today's young computer professionals may have only passing familiarity with

					she calls a "storygame" in terms of established
					genres such as the riddle and the folktale. Where Knuth’s procedural formalism
					argues "you cannot fully appreciate the astonishing brilliance
							of its design until you have seen all of the surprises that have been
							built in [the code]" [<a class="ref" href="#knuth1998">Knuth 1998</a>, 1], Buckles explores the narratives that her volunteer players generated as
					they attempted (often unsuccessfully) to make sense of their partial exposure to
					the simulated world. While Knuth and Buckles could hardly approach their subject
					more differently, both studies take "Adventure" as a
					given, without examining the cultural context in which Crowther and Woods
					created the text, or the context in which its first players interpreted it.

					about authors who overlook "Adventure" remains valid.
					Murray mentions "Adventure" only in an end note,
					describing Crowther's original as a 1972 map and attributing the fantasy
					elements entirely to Woods [<a class="ref" href="#murray1997">Murray 1997</a>, 290]. Douglass uses

					completely overlooks "Adventure", stating "Zork introduced the world to the adventure game" [<a class="ref" href="#chaplin2007">Chaplin 2007</a>]. Yet Costikyan is too scrupulous, using <cite class="title italic">Colossal

						interpret its supposed content, or better yet, project her favourite content
						on it." Murray's approach fails, according to Eskelinen, because
						"consequently we don't learn anything of the features
						that make <cite class="title italic">Tetris</cite> a game". By dismissing
					the value of examining his subject through any critical lens other than strict
					digital formalism, Eskelinen cleaves exclusively to one side of an unnecessary
					fissure between rules-based (ludological) and story-based (narratological) modes
					of games scholarship.<a class="noteRef" href="#d1403e741">[14]</a> This apparent opposition
					illustrates the postmodern assertion that, owing to the socially-constructed
					nature of "meaning," different readers will
					inevitably find different meanings in a given text. For example, <a href="#buckles1985">Buckles (1985)</a> investigates the unique

						actually exceeded that excitement level"[<a class="ref" href="#poole2000">Poole 2000</a>, 107]. In fact, because it had such a big impact

					the observation that humans reach for anthropomorphic images when confronted

						<span class="foreign i">glasnost </span>and <span class="foreign i">perestroika</span>, therefore

						navigation style ("FORWA[RD]", "BACK", "ENTER" and
							"EXIT") are numbered 2-26, with synonyms such

						several synonyms appear at numbers 29 and 30, respectively, while the four
						cardinal compass directions appear in numbers 43-46, and the diagonals at 60

						recalls playing "several versions of ADVENTURE as they
							were being developed"[<a class="ref" href="#mann2003">Mann 2003</a>]. According to Mann, the game had always included
						compass directions; he suggests that the late appearance of the compass
						directions in the vocabulary table indicates that Crowther moved that
						feature from the code file to the data file at that stage of development.
						Further evidence that supports the assertion that compass directions were
						always an important way of navigating in the game is found in Table 6, in
						which items 10, 11 and 14 are displayed variously when the player is having

						"Crowther was interested in using the cave as a setting
						for a game, with magic, puzzles, conflict, and humor. Woods carried that
						forward, but without the feel for being in an actual cave, and with a need
						to limit the use of the machine to off hours. He added mostly policy,
						puzzles and humor" (2004). Crowther supplied the original text-parser
					and established the basic principles of gameplay, leaving Woods free to
					concentrate on expansion, creative variation, and real-world resource management
					(such as a system for resuming a suspended game and a password-protected method
					of restricting access to the game during working hours). Woods retained the
					general structure of the code when he expanded the game, typically adding on to
					the end of the existing tables, and squeezing creative variations out of his own
					imagination and out of possibilities he found in Crowther's original material.
					For example, Crowther's original responds to the command "BLAST" with the message "BLASTING REQUIRES
						DYNAMITE," but none exists in his game. Woods, however, incorporates
						"BLAST" into the finale. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Woods added several rooms to Crowther's existing "ALL
					ALIKE" maze (making the maze more challenging to navigate), and created
					his own maze, where the passages were "ALL
					DIFFERENT." He also created a randomly-moving pirate who steals the
					player's treasures. Crowther supplied the humorous solution to the snake
					obstacle, but when the player tries to unleash the same feathered fury on
					Woods’s dragon, the results are comically disastrous. While Crowther's bottle of
					water can only be emptied, Woods adds complexity by making it refillable and
					capable of carrying water or oil. Woods also supplied puzzles for Crowther's
					consumable items (the food and the water). In a variation on the crystal bridge
					that can appear, Woods adds a bridge that can collapse. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">Where Crowther was an efficient minimalist, Woods was comparatively lavish with
					scenery. Crowther did not create corpse objects for vanquished opponents; once
					defeated, the snake and the dwarves simply vanish. Woods, on the other hand,
					implements separate functional and destroyed objects for the dragon, the bear,
					and the troll bridge. He also created a plant that exists in three states –
					thirsty and small, thirsty and large, and sated and climbable. Because Woods
					added objects with complex behavior, his code had to deal with an even greater
					number of potential events. (For example, what happens when a wandering dwarf
					encounters the bear or the dragon?)</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Woods edited for standard usage, and occasionally for clarity. Upon starting

					passage very early in the game might conclude that the game does not permit any
					manipulation at all. Woods's revision refers more precisely to "TRYING <em class="emph">UNSUCCESSFULLY</em> TO MANIPULATE AN
					OBJECT" (emphasis added). Likewise, where Crowther referred to
					manipulating objects using "ONE OF THE ACTION WORDS THAT I
						KNOW", Woods avoided giving the impression that an object can be
					manipulated with <em class="emph">only</em> one action word, so that his passage refers
					instead to "<em class="emph">SOME</em> OF THE ACTION WORDS"
					(emphasis added).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">Crowther's potent writing features in Room 13, "…A SPLENDID
						CHAMBER THIRTY FEET HIGH. THE WALLS ARE FROZEN RIVERS OF ORANGE STONE. AN
						AWKWARD CANYON AND A GOOD PASSAGE EXIT FROM EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE
						CHAMBER." A forthcoming study of caves as computer game environments
					assesses this passage as follows: <blockquote><p>While the player is informed that the chamber is "splendid," the text does not explicitly state
							what emotional effect the height of the chamber or the proximity of the
								"frozen rivers of orange stone" is
							supposed to have. Rather, we see this location through seasoned,
							critical eyes, duly noting the presence of geological wonders, but then
							immediately evaluating the next possible move, as one must do when
							exploring in a real cave. As it happens, the "awkward" exit from the Orange River Room is the way back to
							the surface, and the "good passage" leads
							deeper into the cave. Without clumsily announcing something like, "The west exit looks so intriguing that you can hardly
								wait to explore it," the text subtly discourages the player's
							premature exit, and reinforces the exploratory premise of classic text
							adventures.  [<a class="ref" href="#jerz2005">Jerz and Thomas 2005</a>]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">"Adventure" succeeds in large part due to the depth
					and realism of the scenery, which is rendered in concise prose that calls
					interesting details to the reader's attention, yet leaves much to the
					imagination. The "Breath-Taking View" (<a href="#crowther1977">Crowther and Woods, Room 126</a>) is an exception;
					co-authored by Gilbert, the graduate student who played Crowther's version of
						"Adventure" with Woods late into the night, its
					effusive language not only tells what the room looks like, but also informs the
					reader what emotions the scene is supposed to invoke (cf. the gorge "FILLED WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO
						HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF"). When Nelson analyzes the
					tension between Crowther's austere fantasy vision and the often comical set
					pieces supplied by Woods, he finds the stylistic conflict an agreeable part of
					the game's charm. "Stretching a point, you could say that there is a
							Crowther and a Woods in every designer, the one intent on recreating an
							experienced world, the other with a really neat puzzle which ought to
							fit <em class="emph">somewhere</em>" [<a class="ref" href="#nelson2001">Nelson 2001</a>, 345]. Notable tension is evident in changes to the cave environment that occur
					in the Woods expansion, such as 1) the underground volcano, 2) the
					battery-dispensing vending machine, and 3) announcements from a public address
					system warning that the cave is closing. Lacking firsthand experience of caves,
					Woods had to rely upon his own imagination. Yet even these details logically
					extend, respectively, Crowther's use of 1) intriguing geography, 2) treasure
					items, and 3) magic words. Some of Woods's additions, such as the Soft Room and
					the Oriental Room, seem completely out of place when considered separately; but
					once it becomes clear that objects found in these two locations work together to
					solve an inventory puzzle, these two incongruities make perfect sense as gaming
					elements. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">In 1994, Crowther reflected on the success of the game: "And

						can do what you want but only if you can figure out the right thing to say
						to it"[<a class="ref" href="#hafner1994">Hafner 1994</a>, 2–3]. Crowther's children both recall instances
					in which their father deflected their frustration with "Adventure" by noting that they were stuck on one of Woods’s details
					(see <a href="#section04">Section 4</a>). According to <a href="#crowther2001">Crowther (2001)</a>, "My intent
						was that the deeper you went into the cave, the more fantasy appeared. Don

					side of the troll bridge, yet this region is only accessible after the player
					has encountered Crowther's earlier scenery, which involves capturing a strangely
					passive little bird, watching the improbable defeat of a fierce snake, conjuring
					up a magical crystal bridge, teleporting via magic words, and fighting with
					dwarves whose corpses vanish. Given this context, the fairy-tale elements that
					Woods supplied (including a dragon, a troll, a beanstalk, more magic words, and
					a friendly bear) seem perfectly in keeping with Crowther's fantasy premise. </div></div></div><div id="section03" class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Exploring Colossal Cave in Kentucky</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52"> Woods's 1977 expansion of "Adventure" features "RECENT ISSUES OF 'SPELUNKER TODAY'

						to caves in Mammoth Cave National Park, and keys are issued to each small
						party of cavers [<a class="ref" href="#freeman1975">Freeman 1975</a>, 33]. The other items found
						in the building also hold a special significance within caving culture. </div><blockquote><p class="ptext">In the chapter entitled "Caving
								Equipment," the handbook [<cite class="title italic">Cave Research
								Foundation Personnel Manual</cite>] lists, among other items,
								"Food" (because cavers typically eat one
							or two meals on an expedition), a "Container for
								lamp water," and "Metal carbide
							lamp." Carbide is a substance that reacts with water to produce a
							flammable gas. Crowther supplied the game with a lamp, a bottle, and a
							source of water—but no carbide. Cave Research Foundation member Tom
							Brucker, who worked with the Crowthers on their intensive 1974 survey of
							Bedquilt, recalls that when he first played the game, he assumed the
							brass lantern would run out of carbide fuel, and assumed that winning
							the game would require finding a fresh supply….(It was Woods who
							supplied the "Adventure" lamp with a timer
							that warns the player that the lantern's power is running out, and who
							also added an underground vending machine—the source of fresh
							batteries.) Other items that are not implemented as objects in the game,
							but whose presence is implied, include a pack and a compass. The CRF
							manual offers a thoughtful soliloquy on the ideal proportions and strap
							configuration for a cave pack (26), and a whole chapter explains the
							proper use of a compass during a map-making survey. [<a class="ref" href="#jerz2005">Jerz and Thomas 2005</a>]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p64">Obviously enough, cavers use a bottle as a source of drinking water. Less

								soon our shovel scratched the gate, about 1.5 feet down. It is, as
								one faces the hill, directly opposite the higher hole and next to
								the left bank. We cleaned the gate and got the old lock to open. The
								lock should be replaced with a Park service lock next trip. The new
								lock should be well-oiled. We relocked the gate, ascended the hill,

						"Completely different from the real cave. It used names
						that we made up," though her assessment is likely influenced by the
					sections added by Woods. According to <a href="#crowther2001">Crowther

					reports that an "Adventure" fan and novice caver, Bev
					Schwartz, knew the game so well that, on her first trip into the real cave,
						"We would be at a junction and she would ask compass
						directions and then begin to tell us what was down this passage or the other
						– all correctly!" Park also offers an anecdote of a party's encounter
					with a real snake while climbing up into the Bird Chamber (see Figures <a href="#figure21">21</a>, <a href="#figure22">22</a>, <a href="#figure23">23</a>): <blockquote><p>[O]ne party member, Roger,

						himself that all he could do was yell "Strike, strike" as the
						copperhead proceeded to do just that. Tom, the party leader, had already
						made the climb up (and not seen the snake). Looking around for something to
						do, he found a stick (was it the MAGIC WAND?), in the Bird Chamber (the room

						travertine). Wand in hand, he moved the snake away.</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p77">77</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p77">Park's references to a snake and rod illustrate the general opinion among cavers

					did make certain deliberate changes when he created the game. For instance, he
					invented the fissure that blocks the player's progress at the Hall of Mists. Tom
					Brucker, who caved with the Crowthers while they were mapping the site, reports
					that in order to create the crystal bridge puzzle,<a class="noteRef" href="#d1403e3301">[20]</a> Crowther edited out a
					passage that would have enabled an easy bypass.</div><blockquote><p class="ptext">Will never liked that passage, even though it loops back to

				unconnected — an event that marks the climax of Brucker and Watson's <cite class="title italic">The Longest Cave</cite> (1976). Interviews with Crowther and his
				family members (sister, two children, and ex-wife) all confirm that the game was
				created shortly after the divorce, which they all say happened in mid-1975 [<a class="ref" href="#crowther2001">Crowther 2001</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#bloom2002">Bloom 2002</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#carter2002">Carter 2002</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#lawrence2002">Lawrence 2002</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#wilcox2002">Wilcox 2002</a>]. Betty Bloom,
				Crowther's sister, recalls spending her sabbatical with Crowther during the time he
				created the game, and was a regular playtester. According to Bloom's records, that
				sabbatical took place during the academic year of 75-76. In separate telephone
				interviews, Crowther's children Sandy (born in 1967) and Laura (born in 1970) recall
				being eight and "less than six," respectively, when they
				first played the game, during a school vacation when they were staying with their
				father. <a href="#crowther2001">Crowther (2001)</a> recalls creating "Adventure" over a period of several weekends; likewise, his
				daughters recall watching the game develop across a span of several different school
				vacations. None of the family members remembers which school vacations were
				involved. Bloom and Sandy both indicate Laura had already turned six, which would
				place the creation of "Adventure" after Laura's sixth
				birthday (in January of 1976). According to Laura: "I think 1972

				administrator) has vivid memories of being "addicted" to
				playing the Crowther/Woods version when she was older; as a child, she remembers
				mostly being frustrated by her father’s version. When asked about her father's

				to a direct request via e-mail, <a href="#crowther2001">Crowther (2001)</a>
				dated his original "Adventure" to 1975, "give or take a year." Certainly Crowther had stopped
				working on the game by the time Woods contacted him (by sending an e-mail to "crowther" at every domain name in existence at the time).
				Woods, in early interviews, gave March or April of 1976 as the date he released his
				expansion; but after examining backup files from his Stanford student account, he
				now says <a href="#crowther2007">(2007)</a> his estimate was off by a year,
				because the oldest relevant files in Woods’s student account (likely representing
				when Woods started on the code, not when Crowther stopped) bear the date March 11,
				1977. Gilbert (one of Woods's Stanford classmates) had written "I'm pretty certain it was between October and December 1975

				the program on his BBN account and left for a vacation is supported by the fact that
				one of these early fans brought it to a Stanford computer, where Woods encountered
				it. Some time before March 11, 1977, Woods contacted Crowther, who gave him access
				to the source code. By March 23, we see in Woods’s records a version with some 20
				additional lines of code — a low-level subroutine that Woods supplied in order to
				get the source to compile. The March 31 set of files again show only minor tweaks.

				confirms that the map of Will Crowther's original "Adventure" closely follows the geography of the real cave, but with fantasy
				and puzzle elements. The original source code shows that Crowther selectively
				deviated from realism; the tension between the altered geography and the mostly
				naturalistic text illustrates Crowther’s respectful intimacy with the natural
				wonders of Colossal Cave. Woods added complexity and polish, with a careful eye for
				improving the user’s experience (and, occasionally, proofreading). His contributions
				more than doubled the size of the original data file (from 728 lines to 1809) and
				more than quadrupled the size of the code file (from 709 lines to 2949). When
				expanding the geography, Woods improvised freely, yet his additions form an
				agreeable tension with Crowther’s naturalistic setting.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p86">86</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p86">Relevant details from caving culture which offer insights into "Adventure" include artifacts in the real "Colossal
					Cave," such as an axe head and a rusty iron rod; human alterations to the
				natural cave, such as carved stone steps and a locked iron gate; natural geographic
				features, such as the striking formations of orange rock and the huge stone slabs
				occupying the space where a magical bridge appears in the game; and newly-assembled
				evidence of Crowther's activities in Colossal Cave, including Cave Research
				Foundation maps and trip reports. This evidence demonstrates the extent to which
				Crowther's familiarity with the real cave provided inspiration for a genre-defining
				new form of artistic expression. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Acknowledgements</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p87">87</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p87">This article was made possible in its present form by a travel grant from Seton Hill
