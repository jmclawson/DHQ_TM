                short-form, time-based digital media created between 1995 and 2005. These works are
                considered in relation to the historical avant-garde - particularly the Structural
                film movement of the 1960s and 70s - and analyzed as responses to a range of
                cultural concerns specific to the digital age. The analysis identifies movement
                toward two terminal points: first, a mode of remix-based montage inspired by open
                source programming communities and peer-to- peer networks; and second, the emergence
                of a mode of imaging termed the "digital analogue", which foregrounds
                the material basis of digital production.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The title of this article refers to Hans Magnus Enzensberger's 1962 essay "The Aporias of the Avant-Garde"[<a class="ref" href="#enzensberger1974">Enzensberger 1974</a>], a cautionary tale and critique of the dangers
                that arise from tying the ideology of the "avant garde"
                to radical social agendas. Enzensberger warns against the pretensions of movements
                like Futurism that were so easily swept up into the political ideology of fascism,
                and the avant-garde's general tendency to slip toward variously doctrinaire forms of
                political sloganeering. As Enzensberger argues, an avant-garde that is unconscious
                of its aporias — its internal contradictions and obfuscations
                — is even more dangerous than the reactionary politics that inevitably
                surface to resist it. Criticism about digital media, which has too often strayed
                into the realm of the utopian, would do well to heed such warnings. And while my
                present argument is largely framed in optimistic terms, it is particularly important
                to recognize the limitations of contemporary "avant-garde" media practices, given the largely hostile political and
                economic climate in which they have emerged. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">As lines between categories of digital art making continue to blur, it is also
                necessary to re-examine outmoded distinctions between the practices and tools of
                cinema, video, music, animation, graphic design and motion graphics. Just as digital
                practitioners move fluidly across these boundaries, theorists and historians of new
                media must develop similarly mobile strategies of critical practice unencumbered by
                the burden of past media and analytical paradigms. Whereas the Modernist avant-garde
                privileged materiality as a means of exploiting the formal potentials of medium
                specificity, the privileged objects in this essay preserve a relation to the
                material world that grounds them historically. Ultimately, it is not an avant-garde
                free of contradictions that we seek, but one that illuminates the position of
                digital media in relation to systems of control — including the rules of
                representation, technology, and history. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">To do this, we will focus on a small number of short-form, time-based, digital media
                — a disparate array of music videos, short films and motion graphics
                created during the past ten years. Despite the fact that the work under
                consideration here has rapidly proliferated and resonated with many of the key
                theoretical issues in cinema and visual culture studies of the past three decades,
                it has been largely neglected by theorists and critics of digital culture.<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e111">[1]</a> Part of the reason for this neglect is practical. The works
                themselves are often ephemeral or difficult to access and they tend to occupy a
                liminal position between what is called "experimental" or
                    "avant-garde" film and video, and the equally broadly defined
                field of practice termed "new media." These works therefore do not
                fit into any consistent curricular or publishing niche, are rarely a part of
                mainstream culture, do not receive theatrical distribution or broadcasting, and are
                often regarded with suspicion as proper objects of study within an academic
                    context.<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e138">[2]</a>
                Nonetheless, I will argue that much of this work may be productively understood as a
                processing ground for some of the most compelling issues in contemporary digital
                culture.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">I am particularly interested in these works' expression of the status of narrative,
                of relations between technology and material culture, and of emergent conceptions of
                space, time, and bodies. As a point of entry, I will ask whether this work may be
                meaningfully understood in relation to the historical avant-garde, particularly the
                Euro-American Structural film movement of the 1960s and 70s. I do not, however, wish
                to spend much time justifying my use of the term "avant-garde," which admittedly carries specific historical connotations that
                are not all applicable to the present discussion.<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e158">[3]</a> Instead, I will focus on two primary vectors of consideration. The first
                is the movement toward what may be termed "open source" video
                authoring, modeled after the combined practices of open source programming
                communities and peer-to-peer file sharing networks. The second is the emergence of
                what I call the "digital analogue," a mode of representation that
                foregrounds material aspects of production seemingly in defiance of the conventional
                wisdom that digital media are characterized by dematerialization and disconnection
                from the physical world. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Because the title of this essay features the rather glaring oxymoron "digital
                    avant-garde," it may be useful to define these terms in isolation in
                order to frame the use I hope to make of them in juxtaposition. The term
                    "digital" rarely denotes a set of cohesive practices. Digital
                media are notoriously hybrid, often bringing together images, sounds, and objects
                that are computer-generated or mediated with others that originate in the analogue,
                photochemical, or textual worlds. There is, however, a certain utility to
                    "digital" as a historicizing term, particularly as it implies its
                own eventual obsolescence. I am less interested, therefore, in defining
                    "digital culture" in terms of technology than in attempting to
                identify the social practices and preoccupations that are particular to the digital
                age. One of the things at stake within the consumer culture that surrounds digital
                media is the growing invisibility of its underpinning technology. Given the current
                movement toward ubiquitous computing and wireless networks, this is of particular
                relevance; even flat panel monitors and microprocessors that are embedded in
                everyday objects seem to negate the physical infrastructure of the computer and by
                implication, its socio-industrial base. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">For the purposes of this essay, the "avant-garde" may be defined as a
                non-singular and contradictory range of minor practices that are dialectically
                related to — i.e., both resistant to and constitutive of —
                dominant media systems. These works are characterized by multiplicity,
                micro-politics and formal experimentation, and perhaps most disquietingly, they are
                often exo-commercial — that is, positioned in a marginal but necessary
                relationship to the economically sustaining infrastructure of the entertainment and
                advertising industries. This working definition is indebted to David James' work on
                American avant-garde film of the 1960s, which debunks the old avant-garde /
                commercial binary as both false and misleading.<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e189">[4]</a> At the level of both institutions and
                individuals, James argues for a historical model that acknowledges the fundamentally
                cross-pollinating relationship between commercial and experimental film practice. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">My desire to reclaim the concept of the avant-garde for the digital age stems from a
                firm belief in the relevance of media to politics and culture. I see great potential
                benefit in developing a critical apparatus for understanding these exo-commercial
                practices as embedded in a broader context with economic and social implications.
                Holly Willis has further argued for the value of seriously considering these works
                as symptomatic indicators of cultural obsessions: <blockquote><p>Despite the general dismissal of these works, many music
                        videos, as well as design shorts, offer a compelling examination of some of
                        the central issues that we face as a culture, and indeed, one might argue
                        that these rather disparate artworks offer a map of contemporary anxieties,
                        fascinations and concerns. [<a class="ref" href="#willis2005">Willis 2005</a>, 51]</p></blockquote>What is ultimately at issue in both "digital" and
                    "avant-garde" is our ability to relate these terms to the needs
                and struggles of everyday life. Put more simply, the goal is to ascribe relevance to
                particular practices of digital culture in a historical context. Thus, I believe it
                is possible to deploy the term "avant-garde" with respect for its
                historical specificity, but at the same time, to make a claim for its continuing
                usefulness in discussing contemporary art practices that have evolved in parallel
                with commercial-industrial media. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Digital Ontology</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Within visual culture, digital imaging has come to signify an ontological shift away
                from the indexical trace of the photograph. Where photochemical imaging could lay
                claim to a direct relation to the physical world, both conventional wisdom and
                everyday experience suggest that digital images more commonly function as hybrid
                constructions of the world they purportedly represent. Although the problematic of
                representing reality long predates the appearance of digital technology, the early
                1990s marked a point of no return for the representational capacity of images. In
                his 1991 book <cite class="title">Representing Reality</cite>, documentary film theorist Bill
                Nichols offered this almost sheepish disclaimer: <blockquote><p>[through digital sampling] The image becomes a series of
                        bits, a pattern of yes/no choices registered within a computer's memory […]
                        There is no original negative […] against which all prints can be compared
                        for accuracy and authenticity. There may not even be an external referent.
                        The implications of all this are only beginning to be grasped. They clearly
                        set a historical framework around the discussion presented in this book,
                        which continues to emphasize the qualities and properties of the
                        photographic image.  [<a class="ref" href="#nichols1991">Nichols 1991</a>, 4]</p></blockquote> The previous year, in his influential book on 19th century visual culture
                    <cite class="title">Techniques of the Observer</cite>, Jonathan Crary noted that digital
                imaging constitutes a categorical break from the photographic processes that were
                developed in the early 19th century. With digital imaging, Crary asserts, vision is
                relocated to <blockquote><p>a plane severed from a human observer […] Most of the
                        historically important functions of the human eye are being supplanted by
                        practices in which visual images no longer have any reference to the
                        position of an observer in a "real," optically
                        perceived world. If these images can be said to refer to anything, it is to
                        millions of bits of electronic, mathematical data. [<a class="ref" href="#crary1990">Crary 1990</a>, 2]</p></blockquote> The problem with digital images, as Crary defines them, is that they are not
                linked in an indexical relationship to the "real world"
                (which he revealingly equates with the "optically
                perceived" world).<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e243">[5]</a> What is at stake here
                are not merely the technical affordances of competing technologies of vision but a
                philosophical metaphor describing the way we attain knowledge about the world. But
                in characterizing the ontological shift represented by digital imaging in terms of
                loss, it is all too easy to find ourselves in a nostalgic desire for the
                prelapsarian authenticity of the photograph — a concept that is itself
                dubious at best.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">In his essay "Avant-Garde as Software," Lev Manovich
                extends this loss to the failure of the avant-garde to sustain the convergence of
                formal and political interests: <blockquote><p>The old media avant-garde came up with new forms, new ways
                        to represent reality and new ways to see the world. The new media
                        avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information […]
                        The new avant-garde is no longer concerned with seeing or representing the

                        accumulated media. [<a class="ref" href="#manovich1999">Manovich 1999</a>, 12]</p></blockquote>Manovich aptly describes the development of database structures and
                recombinant media that are crucial to networked culture. However, his model
                overlooks the potential of this new media avant-garde to engage new ways of seeing
                the world that are rooted not in optical perception but in the harnessing of data
                flows. This shift, summarized by Peter Weibel as a move "from
                    the ruins of representation to the practices of processing"[<a class="ref" href="#weibel2002">Weibel 2002</a>, 2], highlights the need for rethinking networks in
                epistemological terms. This article aims to position the functioning of digital
                networks as not merely a vehicle for the transmission of data, but also a means of
                    "seeing" and understanding the world. At stake in this
                investigation is an emergent understanding of the ways media practitioners are
                enacting new forms of networked subjectivity and creativity that are characteristic
                of an "open source" authoring mode. These networked practices should
                not be uncritically privileged — they are as readily deployed for evil as
                for good — but I want to probe the transformative impact of networks on
                historical avant-garde tactics of appropriation and recombination. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Modernism and Avant-Garde</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">In her book <cite class="title">The Originality of the Avant-Garde and Other Modernist
                Myths</cite>, Rosalind Krauss challenges the discourse of originality on which the
                concept of the Modernist avant-garde was based, arguing that "the actual practice of vanguard art tends to reveal that 'originality' is a
                    working assumption that itself emerges from a ground of repetition and
                    recurrence." Indeed, she argues, originality and repetition are often
                bound together through shared formal and structural constructs, and she identifies
                one such construct — the grid — as a privileged technique of
                spatial organization within the painted modernist frame. For Krauss, photography
                provided the final seeds of destruction of originality as the <span class="foreign i">sine qua
                non</span> of modernist art. Her argument turns approvingly to the photographic
                work of Cindy Sherman and Sherrie Levine as marking a break with the modernist
                notion of origin, moving instead into an era characterized by the postmodernist
                discourse of the copy. Now, the operative question is whether the "discourse
                    of the copy" that so aptly described the Appropriationist movement of
                the 1980s (of which Levine and Sherman were a part) still applies to digital media. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">In digital media, the act of copying has moved from figure to ground, whether at the
                level of the individual pixel, the sample, or the peer-to-peer network. In other
                words, the status of the copy is no longer at stake — it is as much of a
                given to digital composition as brush strokes are to painting. To further update
                Krauss' take on the dynamic interplay between originality and repetition, we must
                revisit her privileging of the grid as a structuring framework. The grid, for
                Krauss, marked Modern art's categorical withdrawal from representation and mimesis. <blockquote><p>Flattened, geometricized, ordered, it is antinatural,
                        antimimetic, antireal. It is what art looks like when it turns its back on
                        nature. In the flatness that results from its coordinates, the grid is the
                        means of crowding out the dimensions of the real and replacing them with the
                        lateral spread of a single surface [<a class="ref" href="#krauss1993">Krauss 1993</a>, 158]</p></blockquote>Krauss goes on to ruminate on the irony of the avant-garde artist turning,
                again and again, in a celebration of his own originality to the form of the grid for
                its realization: <blockquote><p>That so many generations of 20th-century artists should have
                        maneuvered themselves into this particular position of paradox —
                        where they are condemned to repeating, as if by compulsion, the logically
                        fraudulent original — is truly compelling  [<a class="ref" href="#krauss1993">Krauss 1993</a>, 160]</p></blockquote> She further argues that nothing less than the collusion of museums,
                historians, and makers of art has served to continually assert the superiority of
                originality over repetition in modern art, a conundrum that was left to
                postmodernism to outstrip.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Within digital media, however, it seems clear that the two-dimensional X-Y axis of
                Krauss' modernist grid has given way to work that places equal if not greater fetish
                value on the Z-axis, and the possibility, if not the imperative, of composing in
                depth using 3-D modeling software, video game engines, immersive and telepresent
                technologies, mobile media, etc. In his book <cite class="title">Snap to Grid,</cite> Peter
                Lunenfeld identifies the two-dimensional grid as the enemy of the digital designer,
                whose first act upon opening an application is to turn off the snapping function so
                as not to be constrained by the quantum logic of arbitrarily imposed Cartesian
                coordinates [<a class="ref" href="#lunenfeld2000">Lunenfeld 2000</a>]. In the work under consideration here, it
                is possible to identify two responses to this tendency that suggest alternatives to
                the privileging of the Z-axis. Within the realm of the "digital
                analogue," there is frequently a gravitation toward work that foregrounds
                the tension between flatness and depth, a kind of resistance to immersion that
                arguably un-privileges three-dimensionality. And in the zone of networked
                communication, a figurative Z-axis may be understood to signify the dimensional
                structure of the Internet or the datasphere of wireless media that concerns
                practitioners of mobile and distributed media. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Open Source Paradigm</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Within the realm of what may be termed "open source video"
                — i.e., re-edited videos that are distributed online and via file-sharing
                networks — it is possible to view the rhizomatic structure of the
                Internet as a corrective to the Cartesian coordinates of three-dimensional space.
                This is particularly realized in the structure of global peer-to-peer distribution
                networks, which can no longer be regarded as external and posterior to the digital
                artwork itself. Instead, I believe we are witnessing a transformation of the digital
                artwork's position as fundamentally entangled with circuits of replication,
                recombination, dissemination, and along with them, endless potentials for productive
                mutation. Both Lunenfeld and Manovich have described this transformation as a shift
                to "information-based aesthetics," impacting a broad base
                of digital practices from art and architecture to film and computational media. When
                addressing works that emerge from the informational space of the network, we are
                dealing not with originals and reproductions but memes and mutants —
                circuits of data flow and transformation that assert their own ontological status.
                Perhaps most importantly, we must address these networks in both material and
                functional terms, as cultural formations that are the products of material and
                ideological necessity and not merely passive conduits for data. </div><div id="figure01" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000011/resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000011/resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt="Image of the Beatles performing, with a placard reading &#xA;               positioned in front of the drum set"/></a></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">A recent cultural object to emerge from this space is the <cite class="title">Grey Video</cite>,
                which was created and released anonymously in October 2004, only to be shut down by
                the record label EMI as part of its continuing efforts to enforce control over their
                copyright of the Beatles' <cite class="title">White Album</cite>. The background to this story
                is widely known: on February 24, 2004, a group called Downhill Battle organized a
                day-long electronic civil disobedience action called Grey Tuesday. Downhill Battle
                sought to protest the legal action taken by EMI to suppress a remix by DJ Danger
                Mouse that combined rhythm tracks from the Beatles' <cite class="title">White Album</cite> with
                vocal tracks from Jay-Z's <cite class="title">Black Album</cite> to create the underground
                sensation, the <cite class="title">Grey Album</cite>. During the 24 hours of Grey Tuesday, over
                100,000 copies of the <cite class="title">Grey Album</cite> were reportedly downloaded from
                hundreds of sites across the Internet and an estimated million more copies were
                traded over file sharing networks. At the same time, hundreds more websites
                demonstrated their support by converting their home page color palette to all grey.
                Although its impact was largely symbolic, Grey Tuesday is still regarded as the most
                successful instance of organized civil disobedience against the music industry. Nine
                months later, the <cite class="title">Grey Album</cite> was followed by the <cite class="title">Grey
                Video</cite>, which was created and released anonymously by the design firm Ramon
                &amp; Pedro. The "official"<cite class="title">Grey Video</cite> website was predictably shut down within a few weeks of
                its launch, although the video continues to circulate on mirror sites and peer
                networks across the Internet. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">The <cite class="title">Grey Video</cite> begins with a performance by the Beatles before a live
                television studio audience. Just moments into the song, images of the rapper Jay-Z
                begin to encroach on the performance and his own lead vocals are added to the
                background music of a cut-up Beatles song. Images of bumbling and ineffectual
                broadcast engineers may be understood as a metaphorical jab at the RIAA, who are
                powerless to recover control of the images being disseminated, first as Jay-Z's
                image appears on one and then all three television monitors in the control booth and
                later as the musical remix causes a breakdown of both artists' performance. As
                Ringo's drum kit is replaced by a set of turntables and the words "DJ Danger Mouse," the vestigial musicians Paul and George
                are perfunctorily replaced by dancers, and John performs a virtuosic break dance
                punctuated by a protracted round of spinning on his head and a screen-exiting
                backflip that leaves the singer's signature mop-top wig lying symbolically on the
                stage. On one level, all of this amounts to little more than a parodic gesture, but
                the electronic civil disobedience of Grey Tuesday and the visuals of the obviously
                hastily produced <cite class="title">Grey Video</cite> eloquently speak both to consumer
                frustrations with increasingly restrictive copyright laws and to the growing power
                of peer networks to subvert their enforcement. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Apart from the barely noticeable R+P logo that flashes on screen at the end of the

                design team. Indeed, a disclaimer at the head of the video announces that it was
                made as an experiment and not for commercial purposes. But the video was also made
                in full knowledge that the official site would be shut down and trusting in the hope
                that a decentered grassroots network would step in and take over distribution of the
                video. I don't necessarily want to offer Ramon &amp; Pedro as outlaw media
                hackers — they are rather savvy entrepreneurs who understand the economy
                of value in viral marketing and the power of aligning themselves (albeit slightly
                disingenuously) with the anti-industry, anti-commercial sentiments of today's remix
                culture. Taken in aggregate, however, I believe the Downhill Battle protest, coupled
                with the widespread, illicit circulation of the <cite class="title">Grey Video</cite> is
                exemplary of a mode of practice that is defined by the logic of the open source
                network at the level of production, distribution, and reception. Another direct
                legacy of Downhill Battle's Grey Tuesday action is the group's own spinoff
                organization, The Participatory Culture Foundation, a non-profit advocacy group
                which seeks to create tools that facilitate the conjunction of culture and

                directly engaged in resisting corporate domination of media is the Critical Art
                Ensemble (CAE), which argues unabashedly for work that places "a
                    high value on experimentation and on engaging the unbreakable link between
                    representation and politics."<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e397">[7]</a> In their 2002 manifesto <cite class="title">Digital
                    Resistance</cite>, CAE elaborate on their call for a critically engaged "electronic civil disobedience"<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e405">[8]</a> that explicitly works to bridge
                the formal and political dimensions of avant-garde practice. CAE argues that, just
                as capitalism has become increasingly nomadic, mobile, dispersed and electronic,
                artists and activists must respond in kind: modeling forms of digital resistance
                that are equally liquid, but preferably operating by means that are less compatible
                with the status quo functioning of the entertainment industries: <blockquote><p>After all, an avalanche of literature from very fine
                        postmodern critics has for the past two decades consistently told us that
                        the avant-garde is dead and has been placed in a suitable resting plot in
                        the Modernist cemetery alongside its siblings, originality and the author.
                        In the case of the avant-garde, however, perhaps a magic elixir exists that
                        can reanimate this corpse [<a class="ref" href="#cae2002">CAE 2002</a>]</p></blockquote> The elixir they refer to is digital technology and the increasing dependence
                of late capitalist economics on global communication networks and their
                vulnerability to cultural hacking. As CAE insists, "The
                    avant-garde today cannot be the mythic entity it once was. No longer can we
                    believe that artists, revolutionaries, and visionaries are able to step outside
                    of culture to catch a glimpse of the necessities of history as well as the
                    future." In practical terms, CAE propose "cellular
                    constructions aimed at information disruption in cyberspace." They thus
                advocate hacking as both an art form and political weapon, which points to the
                importance of thinking not just in terms of media objects and practices but also of
                their evolving contexts of distribution and exhibition. Unfortunately, the
                vocabulary of Hollywood film distribution obscures the functioning of networks and
                communities — some physical, some online or virtual — within
                which digital files are copied, reproduced, and traded. Within such a network,
                distinctions between viewers and producers are irretrievably blurred, and the
                one-way logic of television broadcasting and theatrical distribution becomes the
                multi-directional, many-to-many dialogue of the BitTorrent network. But how might
                this abstract cultural transformation manifest itself in terms of actual production?
                Part of the answer may be found in the extraordinary proliferation of remix-based

                presidential election. The video was created by means of executing a single
                algorithm: each occurrence (or variation) of the words "terror,""Iraq" and "weapons" was
                extracted from a single speech by President George W. Bush and grouped in the order
                in which they occurred. Nourse's deceptively simple conceit poses a surprisingly
                effective critique of both the Bush campaign's mendacious association of al Qaeda's
                attack on the World Trade Center with the regime of Saddam Hussein and the central
                canard of the administration's advocacy of war, namely the existence of weapons of
                mass destruction in Iraq prior to the American military onslaught in 2003. At the
                same time, Nourse's video invites us to think about the functioning of the news
                media as a passive echo chamber for campaign and administration talking points. The
                low-tech simplicity of Nourse's process invites viewers to imagine creating their

                The result, as with the information-handling capacity of a database system, is to

                them into alphabetical order. In both Nourse's and Clayton's videos, the image of
                the president jumps spastically around the screen, enslaved by the syntactic

                of filmmakers such as James Benning, Su Friedrich, Morgan Fisher, and Martin Arnold.
                Although highly influential among experimental filmmakers, this work was deservedly
                criticized for its makers' decision to pursue a set of artistic interests that were
                fundamentally apolitical and inward-looking, even in the midst of the cultural
                turmoil surrounding the Vietnam war and civil rights movements. For David James,
                this movement aligns seamlessly with the conceptual and minimalist movements in the
                art world — posing an institutional critique of the art world's
                persistent effacement of the materiality of its objects. "Pure
                    film," as James calls it, constituted cinema's response to Clement
                Greenberg's call for medium specificity, drawing attention to the surfaces and
                planes of the film image and its unique, artistic properties by using techniques
                such as scratched emulsion, loop printing, and mathematically derived editing
                structures. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Structural film is often misunderstood as a fundamentally reductive and solipsistic
                practice when, in fact, much of the most interesting work is engaged in broader
                questions of historiography, narrative, memory, perception, and cognition in the
                cinematic processing of space and time. Ernie Gehr's work is exemplary in this
                regard, fulfilling both the rigid structural impulse of the movement's most extreme
                adherents, while simultaneously engaging in broader philosophical,
                historiographical, and perceptual concerns. Likewise, Morgan Fisher's body of work,
                which offers cinema's most esoteric and monomaniacal examination of the processes
                and mechanics of the cinematic apparatus, also constitutes one of its most erudite
                commentaries on otherwise too-easily-suppressed aspects of the Hollywood film
                industry. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">While Structural film has been largely regarded as a footnote within film studies, it
                has resonated with remarkable tenacity in certain sectors of digital media art.
                Lunenfeld's decision to include a chapter on Structural filmmaker Hollis Frampton in
                    <cite class="title">Snap to Grid</cite>, for example, has been much commented upon as a
                bizarre anachrony in a book ostensibly devoted to digital culture and design. But
                Lunenfeld's gravitation toward work by Frampton and other Structuralists is not
                merely idiosyncratic. The majority of Structural films are themselves mathematical
                or algorithmic in conception — characteristics that are consonant with
                the workings of digital media. Indeed Lunenfeld argues, "the
                    ascendancy of the digital image has rendered experimental film ripe for a
                    renaissance […] the experimental cinema can serve as a model for
                    computer-inflected art. I believe, in fact, that the most interesting new media
                    works aspire to the condition of the experimental cinema without quite realizing
                    it."[<a class="ref" href="#lunenfeld2000">Lunenfeld 2000</a>, 120–1]. In her book <cite class="title">New

                classic <cite class="title">Serene Velocity</cite> (1970) as a key progenitor of digital media's
                fascination with space as "our era's primary focus of
                concern," noting that <cite class="title">Serene Velocity</cite> was created within a few

                tongue-in-cheek homage to Gehr and Frampton, whose obsession with film's materiality
                represents the apotheosis of cinematic medium specificity, highlights a key
                distinction between film and digital media. Structural filmmakers' fetishistic
                relationship to their apparatus of production is largely denied to makers of digital
                media, whose creative interactions largely take place within the domain of software
                and therefore rarely reference the role of the computer as object-machine.
                Lattanzi's work instead places its emphasis on interface over physicality and on
                constructing systems that handle and reconfigure pre-existing media into new
                patterns. Idiomorphic software offers users a form of empowerment and control that
                is of an entirely different order than conventional interactive narratives. It also
                suggests ways to talk about the specificity of digital media that do not simply
                replicate the formalist impulses of Structural film. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">The Digital Analogue </h1><div id="figure03" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000011/resources/images/figure03.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000011/resources/images/figure03.jpg" alt="Image showing a sample of Virgil Widrich's work, appearing to be of folded&#xA;                    paper with the faces of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly displayed in a structure&#xA;                    resembling an automobile."/></a></div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Although materiality is often elided within digital media, the physicality of film
                images remains a source of explicit fascination for certain media artists. Perhaps
                the most remarkable of these is Austrian experimental filmmaker Virgil Widrich.
                Along with the filmmakers Peter Tscherkassky and Martin Arnold, Widrich is part of a
                    "third generation" of Austrian experimental
                filmmakers who all share an obsessive interest in fragmenting and decomposing film
                frames and working with movement and repetition within the frame. Until recently,
                Widrich was the only one of the three to work digitally. Both Arnold and
                Tscherkassky have prided themselves on rejecting digital technology, even as they
                create works that are deeply connected to the logic of digital media in their use of
                repetition and recombination. Widrich's work is additionally provocative in its
                return to paper as a substrate for moving images. In the last few years Widrich has
                completed two films — <cite class="title">Copy Shop</cite> (2001) and <cite class="title">Fast
                    Film</cite> (2003) — that are based on a method of production that
                requires thousands of digital video frames to be printed out on paper, folded, torn,
                and then re-animated. On one level, this work constitutes a return to primitive
                cinema, the kind of frame-by-frame, hand-made production described by Lev Manovich
                as characteristic of digital cinema<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e578">[14]</a> — but on another level, it
                demonstrates a process that calls an unusual degree of attention to the material
                substrate of cinema. The result for viewers is an acute awareness not only of the
                materiality of the film they are watching but also of the layering of moments in
                time that is allegorized through the production process. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25"><cite class="title">Fast Film</cite> also presents an extreme and literal use of intertextuality,
                in which characters from nearly three hundred different films move seamlessly
                through a single narrative space. The film suggests a re-assertion of the individual
                subject as the associative consciousness of the narrative and assures that each
                viewing experience will be different, as viewers recognize different clips,
                characters and moments from each sampled film. The structure of <cite class="title">Fast
                Film</cite> is that of a recombinant database that serves as both homage and parody
                in its affectionate pillaging of Hollywood history. Arguably, it is the anxiety
                attending the ethereality of digital technology that occasions this extreme
                foregrounding of material processes — namely the crazy, obsessive work of
                printing, numbering, folding, tearing and then re-photographing tens of thousands of
                film frames. Another factor is our immersion in an era when questions of copyright
                and intellectual property have moved from the expert discourses of litigation and
                technology into the forefront of many people's everyday lives.<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e594">[15]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Widrich's rejection of the ease of digital compositing in favor of laboriously
                captured, printed, torn and folded origami animations provides part of the
                justification for its existence. This labor, in fact, gives the lie to contemporary
                discourses about the ease and simplicity of digital piracy and the lack of
                creativity among those who remix copyrighted materials. The underlying labor is
                self-consciously referenced only once in the film, when a train chase ends by
                plummeting off the side of a cliff. After plunging downward through space, the
                animated cutouts crash through the Mardi Gras cemetery scene from <cite class="title">Easy
                Rider</cite>. The chaotic trains puncture this moment of relative calm, burrowing
                down through the film plane into a thick stack of animation cells as if descending
                through the earth's core. In this moment, Widrich lays bare the part of his
                filmmaking process that would ordinarily be suppressed. We may view this as a return
                to Krauss' modernist grid, which has been deliberately tipped over and laid on its
                side along the Z-axis, while a similar violence is done to the frame —
                that other inviolable rectangle of modern art: nearly every image is torn, folded,
                sawed or crinkled and thereby committed to a new context before being
                rephotographed. <cite class="title">Fast Film</cite> is perhaps the quintessential instance of
                the "digital analogue" — a small but growing subset of
                work that attempts to renegotiate the basic terms of digital representation as
                something that requires attention to the material substrates of even the most
                ephemeral practices. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Against Convergence; For Syncretism</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">It is a truism of the digital age that media have lost their specificity, that art
                history's cherished formal properties have been consigned to the dustbin of history,
                replaced by elaborately sequenced but otherwise undifferentiated combinations of
                zeroes and ones. The rhetoric of digital convergence began in the research
                laboratories at Xerox PARC in the late 1960s and has been a powerful trope of
                digital culture ever since. The concept proved agreeable to the computer and
                entertainment industries as they sought to articulate a vision of technology to
                consumers eager to purchase each successive generation of media technologies en
                route toward one vast interoperable digital system. Convergence also works
                effectively at the level of practice by describing the multifunctional software
                tools used by digital designers who often move fluidly across boundaries of sound
                and image editing, visual effects, CGI, interface design, and animation. Finally,
                convergence offers a useful model for understanding what is happening at the
                corporate level through mergers and the vertical conglomeration of media and
                technology industries. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">For some theorists, however, convergence marks a dangerous turn away from the
                specificity of individual media. Friedrich Kittler, in <cite class="title">Gramophone, Film,
                    Typewriter</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>], describes the situation with what seems to be a rising
                sense of panic: <blockquote><p>Before the end, something is coming to an end. The general
                        digitization of channels and information erases the differences among
                        individual media. Sound and image, voice and text, are reduced to surface
                        effects, known to consumers as interface. […] And once optical fiber
                        networks turn formerly distinct data flows into a standardized series of
                        digitized numbers, any medium can be translated into any other. […] a total
                        media link on a digital base will erase the very concept of medium [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999">Kittler 1999</a>, 1]</p></blockquote> For Kittler, these undifferentiated streams of digital information threaten
                to obviate not only discrete media, but the human bodies once capable of perceiving
                them. The euphoric dissolution of media and bodies resonated in digital theories of
                the late 1990s that emphasized the transition from atoms to bits, and the
                celebratory figuring of digital media as ethereal, disembodied, <em class="emph">cyber</em>.
                The ideology of dematerialization — what Lunenfeld calls "vapor theory" — divorces the products and
                practices of digital culture from their position in history and in the socially and
                materially grounded circumstances of their construction. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">According to this model, not only is it impossible for non-specialists to
                    <em class="emph">understand</em> the workings of digital technology, but a concomitant
                    "myth of transparency" identified by Laura Marks
                renders the material substrates of computer technology
                    <em class="emph">invisible</em>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e643">[16]</a> The promise of
                transparent, ideally functioning technology, Marks argues, taps into latent desires
                for virtual immortality. When we are reminded of the physicality of computers (e.g.,
                via their propensity for crashing), we are also reminded of their imminent
                obsolescence and with it our own mortality. As a corrective, Marks suggests looking
                for "digital artworks that refer to the social circumstances in
                    which they were produced, or that draw attention to the physical platforms on
                    which they were built"[<a class="ref" href="#marks2000">Marks 2000</a>]. For Marks, one such response lies in the fetishization
                of older, deliberately low-tech art forms such as ASCII art that draws attention to
                the physical shapes of letters on the printed page.<a class="noteRef" href="#d34127e654">[17]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">Another alternative to the homogenizing effect of convergence may be found in the
                language of cultural anthropology. The term syncretism, which is used to describe
                the layering of cultural practices brought about by colonialism or immigration
                — the pantheistic worship of Catholic saints in the Santeria religion,
                for example — may also be repurposed to designate the layering of
                technological practices within digital culture. Unlike convergence, a syncretic
                relationship does not imply the erasure or collapse of distinct practices. Rather,
                it describes the combination of disjunctive elements into a functional relationship
                that bears the continued traces of each object's former existence. One consequence
                of the rhetorical shift from convergence to syncretism is the potential
                foregrounding of historicity. Where convergence tends to be ahistorical, syncretism
                emphasizes the temporal gaps between objects and artifacts that remain embedded in
                their historical and cultural moments — not simply in a technological
                register, but in terms of their original cultural resonance. The concept of
                technological syncretism, then, permits an understanding of digital media with
                respect for the material elements of which they are constituted. The hybrid works
                examined here announce a relationship to their medium that invites us to ask the
                    <em class="emph">right</em> questions about how they are constructed and about the
                potential relevance of medium specificity for understanding their importance.
                Arguably, it is through the foregrounding rather than the effacement of the material
                substrates underlying certain instances of digital media, that we find the most
                suggestive and historiographically relevant traces. </div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d34127e111"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>Of

                    well-meaning but overwrought documentary about Fox News, <cite class="title">Outfoxed: Rupert
                        Murdoch's War on Journalism</cite>[<a class="ref" href="#greenwald2004">Greenwald 2004</a>], performs a similarly manipulative rhetorical
                    maneuver in illustrating its critiques against the network with rapid fire
                    montage sequences culled from hundreds or perhaps thousands of hours of recorded
                    broadcasts. The result is a kind of temporary, rhetorical assault that might
                    seem discursively dishonest and unconvincing to anyone who is not already
                    aligned with the film politically. For me, what makes Outfoxed interesting is
                    Greenwald's decision to release his original interview materials into the public
                    domain to be freely used by others — which again underscores the
                    importance of the peer network over the individual artwork as a primary site of
                    political resistance.</div><div class="endnote" id="d34127e453"><span class="noteRef">[10]</span>I view the

                    gallery-based installations titled "Requiem for Avant-Garde
                        Film." Sueoka's body
                    of work includes titles such as <cite class="title">A Film in Which There did NOT Appear

                    in the Library of Congress' Paper Print Collection. This collection was
                    responsible for the preservation of about 3000 films made prior to 1912 when
                    printing images on rolls of paper was the only way to register a copyright; and
                    while the nitrate originals have long since disintegrated or combusted, the
                    paper prints have remained in good condition. A related area to consider are the
                    continuities with the paper base of early computing, including the Turing
                    machine and the punch card-based Hollerith machine. </div><div class="endnote" id="d34127e643"><span class="noteRef">[16]</span>Another way to think about this is in terms of a
                    shift, which has roughly straddled the turn of the 20th - 21st centuries, from a
                    culture that was defined by visuality — e.g., the image saturation of
                    television, movies and advertising — to one that is on its way to
                    being defined, if not by invisibility, then by the tension between visibility
                    and invisibility as intangible global networks and an information economy
                    continue to serve as a staging area for cultural anxieties. This is perhaps most
                    painfully apparent in the practice of color-coded terror alerts which seek to
                    articulate the nation's fear of invisible "sleeper cells" and
                    international terror networks in the visible register.</div><div class="endnote" id="d34127e654"><span class="noteRef">[17]</span>Indeed a sub-genre of
