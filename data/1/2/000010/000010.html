				earliest is interactive fiction (and specifically the "text
				adventure" or "adventure game"), which first came into being
				in the 1970s. Text-based interactive fiction enjoyed a brief period of commercial
				success in the 1980s until it was overtaken by advances in computer graphics, but it
				continues to be read and written by enthusiastic amateurs. Although interactive
				fiction clearly has roots in computer gaming, it also has potential as a new form of
				literature.</p><p>Since interactive fiction may be a medium unfamiliar to some readers, this article
				will start by defining it, explaining some of its conventions, and outlining its
				origins. It will then describe how one recent piece of interactive fiction, "All Hope Abandon", explores aspects of Biblical Studies
				through the medium of IF, and will end by suggesting a number of fruitful links
				between interactive fiction and biblical text. In the course of the article several
				examples from "All Hope Abandon" will be given, and
				instructions on how to install and play the game will be provided at the end.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">What is Interactive Fiction?</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The term "interactive fiction" (or IF) can have more than one meaning
				in the context of computer-based storytelling. In this article, however, the term
				will be used in the narrow sense of a turn-based program driven by textual input
				from the player, responding with output that is principally or wholly textual, and
				involving a parser and a world model (two terms which will explained shortly). For
				the sake of brevity, the term "game" will be used to denote a work of
				interactive fiction, though not all such works are equally ludic, and the reader
				should not rush to equate IF "games" with the video-games more
				commonly associated with contemporary recreational computing.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Such a work is <em class="emph">interactive</em> fiction since it is up to the reader (or
				player) to drive the story forward, usually by directing the actions of the main
				protagonist (known in IF-parlance as the player character, or PC). A work of IF
				typically opens with a brief textual description of the PC’s situation, perhaps also
				giving some indication of the tasks the PC has to perform, or the challenges he or
				she has to overcome, though these may not become apparent until the game gets under
				way. In order to progress through the game the PC must explore his or her
				environment, discover how things work, interact with any other characters in the
				game (known in IF-parlance as non-player characters or NPCs), and often solve a
				number of puzzles. The role of the player is to direct the PC in these tasks by
				entering commands at the keyboard.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e141">[1]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Part of the appeal of IF is the illusion that one has complete freedom to type
				anything one likes at the game’s command prompt. It <em class="emph">is</em> an illusion
				because, although one can indeed type anything one likes, the game will in fact
				understand only a very restricted subset of English (or whatever language the game
				was written in). The commands typically understood by a modern IF parser are largely
				restricted to the following three formats: either a simple imperative verb (such as
				LOOK, which generates a description of the PC’s current location), or an imperative
				verb plus a direct object (such as TAKE THE BLUE BALL, which would cause the PC to
				pick up the blue ball, assuming the action is possible), or an imperative verb plus
				a direct object plus a preposition plus a second or indirect object (such as PUT THE
				BLUE BALL IN THE BROWN BOX). This basic syntax can be slightly extended to allow
				conversing with or giving orders to NPCs; so, for example, FRED, PUT THE BLUE BALL
				IN THE BROWN BOX would be construed as a command to the PC to tell the NPC called
				Fred to put the blue ball in the brown box.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The role of the <em class="term">parser</em> in interactive fiction is to interpret such
				commands so that the game can either respond to them appropriately, or tell the
				player why it can’t. A modern IF parser is reasonably sophisticated at this task. If
				there is both a red ball and a blue ball in the game, a decent parser will
				nevertheless know what to do with a seemingly ambiguous command like TAKE BALL. If
				only one of the balls is in sight, it will assume that this is the one the player
				meant. If both balls are in sight but the PC is already holding one of them, the
				parser will assume the player meant to refer to the other. Only if the parser is
				unable to resolve the ambiguity in any such way will it ask the player to do so
				(typically by asking a question like "Which ball do you mean:
					the blue ball or the red ball?").</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">A more sophisticated parser will also deal automatically with certain implicit
				actions needed to carry the player’s explicit command. For example if the player
				types N (the usual abbreviation for GO NORTH) when going north would take the PC
				through a closed door, a good parser will assume that the player wants the PC to
				open the door first, and will first attempt opening the door as an implicit action,
				only carrying out the main action if the required implicit action succeeds (it may
				not, since the door may be locked or jammed or inaccessible for some reason). Or if
				the PC needs to be holding the blue ball before he can put it in the brown box, then
				a courteous parser will carrying out an implicit TAKE BLUE BALL command when the
				player types PUT BLUE BALL IN BROWN BOX, rather than complaining that the PC needs
				to be holding the blue ball first. Unfortunately, not all parsers achieve this level
				of user-friendliness.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">A modern IF parser works first by identifying what <em class="term">action</em> the player
				intends, and then by resolving the nouns involved in the action. For example, the
				TADS 3 parser (written in the TADS 3 language) first matches the player’s input
				against the grammatical patterns (known as "grammar productions")
				contained in the TADS 3 library and the game author’s own code: thus if the player
				types PUT BALL IN BOX the parser first determines that this matches the pattern 
			  <span class="monospace">PUT &lt;noun phrase&gt; IN &lt;noun phrase&gt;</span> and so decides that the
				current action is of type <em class="term">PutInAction</em>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e191">[2]</a> The parser
				then constructs lists of possible objects that could match the two noun-phrase
				slots. Possible matches are restricted to those objects in the game that (a) possess
				vocabulary corresponding to what the player typed and (b) are currently in scope
				(roughly speaking, this means that they must be currently visible to the player
				character). These lists are then sorted in order of logicality (i.e. fitness for
				their role in the proposed action). For example, for a PUT IN action to succeed its
				direct object (occupied by the first noun slot) must be something that the player
				character can move, so that a small rubber ball will be a more
				"logical" target for such a command than a large stone ball fixed to
				the top of an ornamental balustrade. Likewise, for a PUT IN action to succeed, its
				indirect object (occupying the second noun slot) must be a container of some sort,
				so that, for example, a large cardboard box is a more "logical"
				target for a PUT IN command than a box girder. If this object resolution phase
				results in one and only one most logical possibility for each of the noun slots,
				then the parser will settle on these objects; otherwise it will either request
				further clarification from the player (to select from a number of possibilities) or
				complain that there is nothing in scope that matches the command
					entered.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e203">[3]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The second defining characteristic of interactive fiction is the <em class="term">world
				model</em>. Most IF is set in a simulated environment representing physical space
				and the objects it contains (though there may be the occasional exception). Broadly
				speaking, this corresponds to the <em class="term">setting</em> of a conventional narrative.
				Different IF systems and different games written with those systems will implement
				this simulated environment to different depths, but there are certain features that
				most if not all works of IF share. Firstly, the physical world is generally modelled
				as a series of discrete locations known as <em class="term">rooms</em>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e219">[4]</a> The totality of rooms in a given
				work of IF is often referred to as the <em class="term">map</em>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e230">[5]</a> Such rooms could correspond to rooms in a building,
				but they need not and frequently do not: a "room" in the IF sense is
				just as likely to be a section of path through a forest, or one corner of a large
				town square, or a section of meadow-bank overlooking a lake. Conceptually, a room is
				that segment of physical space that is immediately accessible to the player
				character. The notional size of a room can vary greatly, but is assumed that, with
				certain qualifications, the PC can see and hear everything in the room in which he
				or she is located unless it is purposely hidden; and can taste, touch or smell
				everything in the room unless it is deliberately placed out of reach. The standard
				IF convention is that, with one exception to be dealt with below, the movement of
				the characters and objects within a room is not normally modelled. It may be that I
				would in fact have to cross a large study to take a book off the shelf, but this
				detail is generally ignored in IF; it is assumed that the PC (and any NPCs) will
				move around within a room as necessary without being explicitly commanded to, and
				such internal movements will not normally be reported, unless the game author
				explicitly wishes to mention them for artistic effect. Thus few games bother to
				implement commands such as WALK OVER TO THE TABLE or APPROACH THE BOOKCASE, since
				they would generally be superfluous.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e236">[6]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">It is perfectly possible for a complete work of IF to take place within a single
				room, and some do, but it is more normal for a game to contain multiple rooms and
				for the PC (and possibly the NPCs as well) to move around between them. By far the
				most normal convention is for movement commands to be given in terms of the eight
				principal compass directions together with UP, DOWN, IN and OUT. This should 				understood as a convention of the medium, not as a pretense that the PC in fact
				carries an infallible compass in his or her head; experience has shown that in
				practice this is generally the most convenient way for a player to communicate
				movement intentions to the parser, not least because movement commands can be
				abbreviated to N, SW and the like. But other styles of movement command such as GO
				THROUGH RED DOOR and ENTER THE BIG HOUSE are also common. Less common, but also
				possible are commands to go to a specific location, such as GO TO THE KITCHEN.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">In the normal IF world model, rooms are populated with <em class="term">objects</em>. These
				may be portable objects that the PC can pick up and carry around, or non-portable
				objects such as trees and houses and heavy furniture that remain fixed in place.
				Some objects may play an integral part in the game, while others may only be
				scenery. Standard IF world models also implement a <em class="term">containment
				hierarchy</em> for objects. Everything currently in the game must be contained in
				a room, but within rooms some objects may contain other objects. The most commonly
				implemented containment relations are <em class="term">inside</em> (for containers like
				boxes, desk drawers, pockets and sacks) and <em class="term">on top of</em> (for supporters
				like desks, tables and trays). Some objects, such as chairs, beds and platforms, may
				also contain the PC and other characters; these constitute the exception to the rule
				that movement within rooms is not normally modelled, since movement in and out of
				containers like beds and chairs normally is dealt with explicitly.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Although most objects in a game are normally inanimate (as are most objects we
				commonly interact with in the real world), some may be designed to represent animate
				objects such as cats and cows or even people (or quasi-animate objects such as
				robots and talking computers). Clearly such objects – especially people – are a good
				deal more complicated to implement well.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The earliest game of this type was principally a simulation of the Bedquilt/Flint
				Mammoth cave network created by Will Crowther, originally as an amusement for his
				daughters (<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#montfort2003a">#montfort2003a</a></span>; [<a class="ref" href="#nelson2001">Nelson 2001</a>, 342–45];

					in this issue</a>]. It was subsequently expanded by Don Woods with a number of
				additional puzzles and treasures, and has continued to be expanded in many versions
				since, being readily available, generally under the name "Adventure" but sometimes called "Colossal
				Cave", "Colossal Adventure" or a number of other
            	names.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e276">[7]</a> This may be one reason why works of IF
				are also known as "text adventures" (even when the plot may involve
				little that resembles adventuring in any conventional sense). </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Adventure’s parser was originally written in FORTRAN, and was primitive by modern
				standards: it was a "two-word" parser since the most complex commands
				it could understand were in the form of an imperative verb and a single noun. The
				game had little narrative plot, being mainly a treasure hunt, but the fact that,
				unlike many of its successors and imitators, it was based on a real cave system by
				an author who knew it well gives it a certain enduring charm.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">The most significant successor and imitator of "Adventure"
				was a game first called "Dungeon" and then "Zork", originally written on a university mainframe (at
				MIT, beginning in May 1977) <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#montfort2003a">#montfort2003a</a></span>. Although "Zork" was arguably even more of a puzzle-driven
				treasure-hunt set in a less coherent and authentic world that "Adventure", it did achieve a more sophisticated parser capable of
				two-object commands (such as PUT BALL IN BUCKET or HIT TROLL WITH SWORD). Of even
				more significance is that in June 1979 the authors of the original Zork went on to
				found a company called Infocom, which proved highly successful in writing and
				marketing text adventures, or what it came to call interactive fiction <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#montfort2003a">#montfort2003a</a></span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e311">[8]</a> Not only did Infocom establish the
				conventions that IF still largely follows today, it also showed that the medium was
				capable of far more than cave-crawling treasure-hunts.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Infocom (and other companies like it) made a great success of interactive fiction in
				the 1980s, but as home computers became more powerful and ever more capable of
				displaying good graphics, text-based games fell out of favour with computer gamers
				who could be offered much more visually appealing graphical video-games instead. But
				while interactive fiction largely fell out of sight, it did not die, but continued
				to develop in the hands of enthusiastic amateurs.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e319">[9]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">It is possible to write a work of interactive fiction from scratch in a
				general-purpose programming language such as Basic, C#, or Pascal, but it is
				extremely inadvisable to do so unless your primary aim is to practice programming in
				one of those languages. Implementing a robust parser and world model is a decidedly
				non-trivial task, and any case IF is best served by a domain-specific language.
				Systems for authoring IF had been available for some time, but amateur IF received a
				considerable boost in the early 1990s from the release first of Mike Roberts’s TADS
				(Text Adventure Design System), and then Inform, created by Oxford mathematician
				Graham Nelson.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">These systems comprise special-purpose programming languages (TADS, for example, is
				quite similar to C), together with a library (usually written in the same language)
				providing a standard parser and world model (which can then be extended or modified
				to a greater or lesser extent in the game author’s own code). They may also contain
				additional tools such as an integrated development environment or a debugger. The
				compilers for these languages typically output, not a native executable, but a
				byte-code file designed for running in a virtual machine on a program called an
					"interpreter" (similar to the way a Java compiler produces
				byte-code to run on a Java Virtual Machine).<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e343">[10]</a> This allows games written in TADS, Inform and similar IF languages to
				run on any system for which the appropriate interpreter has been written.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Inform had two great advantages when it was first released: first, it was free, at a
				time when Mike Roberts still charged for TADS (though it has now been available free
				for many years),<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e348">[11]</a> and second, it compiled to the same format
				(known as the Z-machine) as the much-loved Infocom games.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e354">[12]</a> With these tools it became
				possible for amateur IF enthusiasts to write games as good as or even better than
				those produced by Infocom and its competitors (which is not to say that the systems
				have not also been used to produce a glut of games that are far worse). 2006 saw the
				release of the latest version of both of these authoring systems: Inform 7 (still in
				beta) and TADS 3 (finally out of beta after several years).<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e363">[13]</a> Inform 7 is an experiment in a
				natural-language style of programming that is proving attractive to many potential
				authors who would not feel so comfortable with conventional coding.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e372">[14]</a> TADS 3 is more like
				a conventional programming language (much of its syntax is identical to
					C),<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e384">[15]</a> but incorporates the most sophisticated parser and world model yet
				seen in IF, as well as providing the best toolset to date for the implementation of

				experiment, and one trend has been an increasing appreciation and ambition for
				story-driven as opposed to puzzle-driven IF. That is not to say that well-made
				puzzle games do not continue to be appreciated – they clearly are<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e404">[17]</a> – but there has
				also been increasing interest in the narrative possibilities of IF. There have also
				been developments in the generally accepted conventions of the medium. Back in the
				1980s, and even the early 1990s, IF games often contained huge illogical mazes and
				puzzles that were frequently arbitrary and unfair, as well as all too often allowing
				a player to continue unknowingly with a game long after it had been put into an
				un-winnable state. Such things are now usually frowned upon. The modern ideals are
				that puzzles should be properly and fairly clued, and fully integrated into the
				narrative structure of the game (although this can often be hard to achieve), that
				the player should be given fair warning if the game gets into an un-winnable state,
				and that no game should contain a maze without a very good reason for it indeed (and
				even then it had better be a very original kind of maze). Again, modern standards
				are much more demanding on depth of implementation. If a room description mentions
				striped wallpaper then the parser had better recognize striped wallpaper if the
				player tries to refer to it. It may be acceptable for the parser to respond with
					"The striped wallpaper is not important" if the
				wallpaper is indeed pure scenery, but it looks very clumsy if, having told the
				player that the room is decorated with striped wallpaper, the game responds with
					"You see no such thing" when the player tries to
				examine it (as would all too often be the case in much "old-school"
				IF and all too much poorly-implemented modern IF). It is better still if a
				description of the wallpaper is provided in response to "X
					WALLPAPER" (i.e. EXAMINE WALLPAPER), even if the "not
				important" message is used in response to any other command involving the
				wallpaper; this kind of detail can make the difference between immersion in the
				story world and the feeling that, after all, you are merely interacting with a
				computer program.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e435">[18]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">These modern expectations raise a further pair of issues, namely the roles of room
				descriptions and puzzles. In conventional (or "static") fiction a
				description of a location may be used, <span class="foreign i">inter alia</span>, to paint a
				picture in the eye of the reader, or to evoke a mood, or to provide information
				needed to understand the plot. All these functions apply to room descriptions in
				interactive fiction, but with additional constraints. First, whereas the author of a
				novel or short story has considerable latitude in choosing the length of any
				description (provided it is not so long as to kill the narrative momentum), an IF
				author has to be economical; the text of a room description (or any other kind of
				output) will appear on a scrolling screen between one command prompt and the next,
				and for that reason will appear too long if it amounts to more than half a dozen
				lines of text or so. Second, there are certain pieces of information that a room
				description must convey to the player, not least the direction of the available
				exits from the current location. Third, the description ideally needs to be so
				arranged as to draw the player’s attention to items that merit further investigation
				(say, the large desk in the corner, in which resides an important letter from the
				PC’s husband’s lover) rather than to items that are purely decorative (such as an
				ornamental vase on the mantelpiece). To achieve all these goals while writing good
				prose is not always easy; one technique is to minimize the kind of extraneous detail
				that might typically be used for scene-setting in static fiction.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e445">[19]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">It is possible to write IF that is virtually puzzleless, but puzzles can play an
				important part even in IF that aims to be more literary than ludic.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e458">[20]</a> What exactly constitutes a puzzle is a little
				hard to define; in essence it is a task that the player has to perform or an
				obstacle he or she has to overcome where the necessary sequence of actions is not
				immediately obvious but requires some thought or experimentation to arrive at; but
				what may seem immediately obvious to one player may seem more obscure to another.
				However defined, puzzles have a number of important uses. First, they may simply be
				integral to the plot, since the game may describe a situation in which the
				protagonist would naturally have to overcome obstacles or achieve difficult tasks of
				this type (for example, if the protagonist is a detective investigating a murder).
				Second, puzzles are one of the main devices in IF for creating a sense of tension
				and opposition, without which any narrative is liable to feel dull and slack. Third,
				they can help pace and direct the plot. In static fiction, authors have complete
				control over the course of events and can accordingly structure their narrative to
				suit their plot. Authors of IF surrender much of this control to the player, who
				controls the actions of the protagonist and thus the course of events. Putting
				strategically placed obstacles in the path of the protagonist is a means of
				regaining a measure of authorial control; for example certain parts of the map can
				be closed off until certain tasks have been performed (paradigmatically, the PC
				cannot pass through the locked door until he or she has discovered the key), or the
				accomplishment of certain tasks can trigger certain key events. Third, placing
				obstacles in the path of the PC can deepen the players’ involvement in the narrative
				by forcing them to think about the PC’s situation and come up with a solution.
				Players are made to identify more closely with the actions of the protagonist if
				they have directed those actions themselves, and can feel a considerable sense of
				satisfaction at being able to overcome a difficult obstacle. But puzzles can also
				misfire in a number of ways. If they are too hard they can bring the narrative to a
				standstill as the player thrashes about in increasing frustration trying to find a
				solution. If they seem arbitrary, insufficiently well clued, or otherwise unfair
				they can simply provoke annoyance. Conversely, if they seem too easy there is little
				satisfaction at solving them, and a sense of tedium may set in if the player is
				forced to go through a series of routine actions (find next key, unlock next
					door).<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e467">[21]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Puzzles are not the only way to achieve some of these effects; for example, it would
				be possible to present the player with a series of choices that were not so much
				puzzles as dilemmas, or to write a puzzleless simulation,<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e478">[22]</a>
				or a game that works in some other way, but this can be difficult to bring off. If a
				game presents players with more or less the same linear narrative without offering
				any significant challenges, it can all too easily create the feeling that one may as
				well be pressing the space bar between reading chunks of text, and that the story
				might better have been presented as conventional static fiction. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">What drives the narrative in most static fiction is the interaction between the
				(normally human) characters, but this is the hardest thing to do well in interactive
				fiction, particularly when it comes to representing the subtleties of human
				relationships. Many NPCs in IF turn out to be little more than elaborate puzzles or
				talking robots. Examples of the first category might be someone I have to get out of
				the way so I can see what’s in his desk or the bouncer who won’t let me past the
				door. The second category is part of the wider reason it is so difficult to produce
				lifelike NPCs in IF, namely the difficulty of producing realistic dialogue in the
				medium.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">Authors of static fiction have complete control over what their characters say, with
				all the nuances that may imply for the relationships between them. Authors of IF
				surrender control of speech as well as action to their players, but whereas a good
				modern IF parser can cope very well with interpreting commands directed at physical
				action, the same is not so true of speech commands. The reason is quite
				straightforward: whereas there is only a fairly limited range of physical actions a
				PC might sensibly attempt at any one time, there is no such limit to what he or she
				might sensibly say, but the technology to make sense of any textual input and
				provide a good response simply does not exist, and would in any case be a move away
				from interactive fiction to artificial intelligence (at least as things are now).
				Attempting fake AI in NPC responses (for example, by getting the parser to look out
				for certain keywords) is nearly always a bad idea, since it is almost bound to be
				given away by incongruous responses sooner or later. The only practical solution
				with existing IF parser technology is to put a drastic limit on the range and syntax
				of conversational commands, and to program a finite range of suitable NPC responses,
				together with a range of totally non-committal "default" responses
				for topics not otherwise catered for.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">A number of approaches are possible within these limitations.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e496">[23]</a> The
				simplest is to restrict conversational commands to TALK TO X, and then respond with
				canned conversation; this can work well enough in certain contexts, and does retain
				maximum authorial control over the course of conversations, but greatly restricts
				players’ freedom of choice with concomitant loss of interactivity. Another option is
				to have TALK TO X respond with a menu of things the PC can say (possibly linked with
				a second command to switch topic); again this can work reasonably well, but is not
				without its disadvantages, the most prominent of which are first that switching to a
				restricted-choice menu interface may not sit well with the open-ended command line
				interface used for every other kind of player input, and second that when players
				are presented with a menu interface for conversations the temptation is to try to
				navigate them like a kind of conversational maze, which risks breaking immersion in
				the narrative.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">Perhaps the most commonly used conversation system, and that most frequently provided
				as standard in many IF authoring system, is the ASK/TELL system. This allows players
				to type commands of the form ASK BOB ABOUT THE LETTER or TELL JILL ABOUT JANE, where
				what follows "ABOUT" is a topic to which the NPC may have
				a programmed response (the ASK/TELL system usually also allows SHOW SOMETHING TO
				SOMEONE and GIVE SOMETHING TO SOMEONE and often ASK SOMEONE FOR SOMETHING). The
				advantages of this system is that it allows a form of user input congruent with the
				user interface used for all other commands, preserves the illusion of player
				freedom, but makes it reasonably possible for the author to provide suitable
				responses, at least to the most significant topics (the others can then be fielded
				with a non-commital response such as "Let’s talk about that some
					other time" or "Bob pretends not to hear
				you"). The disadvantages are first that the NPC can all too easily end up
				resembling a talking robot more than a believable human being (for example if the
				command ASK BOB ABOUT LETTER repeatedly provokes the response, "'It’s from Jill'; he tells you, 'she’s left me to run off with
					Jack!'"), and second that the system allows little or no control over
				what precisely is asked or told: if I issue the command ASK BOB ABOUT LETTER do I
				want to ask Bob who the letter is from, or what it says, or when he received it? If
				I type the command TELL JILL ABOUT JANE do I want to tell Jill that Jane is
				pregnant, or that I’m in love with her, or that she’s emigrated to Australia? In
				particular, the only dimension of human conversation it copes with is the exchange
				of information; it is thus quite incapable of modelling, say, a developing
				relationship (whether of affection or enmity) in any realistic way.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">One of the great achievements of TADS 3 is that it extends the ASK/TELL system in a
				number of ways that greatly mitigate these limitations. For example, it provides
				tools for varying NPCs’ responses in accordance with what has been said before, and
				for threading conversations in a more realistic manner, allowing a greater range of
				possible responses that just ASK or TELL at critical points in the dialogue. It also
				encourages authors to write both halves of a conversational exchange, which
				generally makes the dialogue read much better.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e522">[24]</a> It is not
				that it is impossible to do these things in other IF languages, but rather that TADS
				3 provides by far the best set of tools as standard (and also makes it reasonably
				easy for more ambitious authors to extend them as desired). This is one reason why
				TADS 3 was chosen for "All Hope Abandon" (as well as a
				number of other games I have written).</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">The difficulty of implementing life-like NPCs is perhaps one of the major differences
				between IF and conventional static fiction; it can certainly restrict the kind of
				story that can be told well in the medium, since it is far harder to produce a game
				involving the emotional interaction of characters (such as a love story) than one
				focusing mainly on the gathering and exchange of information (a detective story or
				spy story, for example). That is not to say that IF necessarily lacks emotional
				impact, but this must often be achieved by other means, and it would be fair to say
				that the implementation of convincing NPCs is one area in which there is currently
				vast scope for experimentation. But the more fundamental difference between static
				and interactive fiction is that the latter is interactive, and requires a particular
				kind of input from the reader to advance the story. This is not to say that the
				reader of static fiction is wholly passive, as reader-response criticism in
				particular emphasizes, but IF does raise reader participation to a greater level; it
				also both operates under different constraints and offers different opportunities
				from static fiction.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e536">[25]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">Implementing the Player Character also presents its own challenges. In early works
				such as "Adventure" and "Zork"
				this was not an issue, since the PC was usually anonymous with no characteristics
				beyond the ability to act as the player’s eyes and hands in the game. Once authors
				became more interested in the narrative possibilities of IF this changed, however;
				PCs needed to become more specific, of a determinate gender, with particular
				characteristics and a history of their own, more like the protagonists of
				conventional figure than the convenient puppets of the early games. This then raises
				the possibility that the PC’s motivations might clash with those of the player who
				is supposed to be controlling his or her actions. In such a case the game author has
				to choose between allowing the action at the cost of the integrity of the character,
				or disallowing the action at the cost of restricting player freedom. This potential
				conflict is normally resolved by means of some kind of compromise: typically a PC
				might be motivationally restricted from committing murder or suicide while being far
				less scrupulous about stealing (since players of IF quickly develop the kleptomaniac
				strategy of taking anything that isn’t nailed down on the assumption that it will
				probably come in useful later in the game). It is in any case impossible to satisfy
				all players, since some will always complain if the PC won’t do their bidding
					("but Bob is such an irritating character that I
					<em class="emph">want</em> to punch him on the jaw", while others will complain if
				they can make their PC act too obviously out of character ("my
					PC is meant to be a genteel elderly spinster who would <em class="emph">never</em> punch
					anyone on the jaw, however irritating she found him!"); nevertheless,
				some kind of reasonable compromise seems to satisfy most players most of the time.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">Less easy to negotiate is the discrepancy that can arise between what the player
				knows and what the player character supposedly knows. This can work both ways.
				Someone playing a game for the second or subsequent time almost certainly starts out
				knowing more than the PC knows at the start of the game, and this can create
				problems when the player wants to put that additional knowledge to use. Before the
				PC has been introduced to Mrs. Prancealot he logically cannot know that she
				<em class="emph">is</em> Mrs. Prancealot, but the player may try to refer to her as Mrs.
				Prancealot before the introduction takes place and become irritated either because
				the parser allows the use of the name that the PC cannot yet know or because it
				refuses to recognize the name that the player knows perfectly well. Or, to take
				another example, if a key has been dropped under a sofa, should second time players
				be forced to issue a LOOK UNDER SOFA command in order to be allowed to refer to a
				key they already know to be there? Some players may find such a restriction irksome,
				while others may feel it unreasonable that the PC can pick up a key from under the
				sofa before he has any good reason to suspect its presence there. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">Conversely, the PC may well know things the player (especially the first time player)
				does not. Such knowledge may be relatively trivial, such as the PC’s knowledge of
				his or her own locality, which the player has to discover by exploration (this can
				usually be handled by writing room descriptions that emphasize the PC’s familiarity
				with the locations visited). But it may be something rather more complex, such as
				the specialist knowledge the PC ought to possess in his or her persona as
				safe-cracker, starship captain, or (as in the example about to be discussed)
				scholar. This can be particularly tricky if it results in the player fumbling to
				perform tasks the PC ought to be able to manage in his or her sleep, or if the PC’s
				specialist knowledge is particularly relevant to understanding the puzzles and other
				plot elements, as turned out to be the case in "All Hope
					Abandon".<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e574">[26]</a></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">All Hope Abandon</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">The particular example of IF to be discussed here is one of my own works, "All Hope Abandon".

				temptations of an alluring female demoness (a sort of demonic counterpart to

				Roman emperor (representing an amalgam of all the emperors from Augustus to
				Domitian). The chess game is played out with somewhat unconventional pieces and is
				meant to reflect, first the events leading up to the Jewish war of 66-70 CE, and

				the chasm, and on that decision rests the ultimate fate of the PC. If the right
				choice is made, the PC wakes up in a hospital bed with the real Felicity Hope at his
				side; otherwise he is eternally lost.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">In the most general terms, my design goals were to combine my interest in Biblical
				Studies with my interest in interactive fiction in a game that contained a
				substantial surreal (or at least, non-real-world) segment that would give some sense
				of what it might be like to inhabit one interpretation of the Christian
				symbolic/mythological universe. I also wanted to poke fun at some aspects of New
				Testament scholarship of the last hundred years, while unobtrusively informing
				players about it. The game also had to be entertaining and engaging to play, given
				that my target audience would be fellow IF-enthusiasts rather than fellow New
				Testament scholars. It therefore had to conform to the conventions and expectations
				of the medium, and it seemed advisable to include elements such as puzzles that
				would hopefully prove amusing and accessible to all players, regardless of their
				background knowledge, on the basis of information provided in the game. It was quite
				emphatically not meant to preach to the player.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">The game seems to have achieved mixed success in relation to those goals. On the
				positive side "All Hope Abandon" received nominations in
				six out of the ten categories for Xyzzy awards (the Oscars of IF, named after a
				magic word featured in "Adventure") for games released in
				2005, although it failed to win the prize in any of them (see <a class="ref" href="http://wurb.com/if/award/3#518" onclick="window.open('http://wurb.com/if/award/3#518'); return false">http://wurb.com/if/award/3#518</a>).
				In general it also seems to have been well received; the fact that it does not try
				to preach to the player was generally appreciated, and it received a number of
				broadly favourable reviews.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e722">[28]</a> On the other hand the overarching scholarly
				and mythological structures that were intended to lend coherence to the two main
				afterlife sections were clearly missed by some players, to whom these sections then
				appeared to be a somewhat rag-bag collection of puzzles [<a class="ref" href="#shiovitz2004a">Shiovitz 2004a</a>]. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">This underlines the main design challenge I faced: the huge gap between PC and player
				knowledge. Although this can be an issue in any work of IF, in this case the problem
				was acute: my PC was a New Testament scholar who could be expected to have a
				thorough knowledge not only of the biblical text and related ancient texts, but also
				of the contemporary scholarly debate surrounding them. My target audience might have
				none of this knowledge, and it became apparent in the course of beta-testing and
				subsequent player feedback that many players did not possess even the most
				elementary knowledge of the biblical stories presupposed and alluded to in the game.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">My first attempt at meeting this problem was to add footnotes to responses I thought
				might be a little obscure.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e740">[29]</a> But I
				quickly came to the conclusion that this solution was both cumbersome and obtrusive.
				Players who wished to refresh their memories of what a footnote said on a particular
				topic would have to remember the number of the footnote in which the topic was
				discussed (or else scroll back to find it), and there were so many responses that
				potentially needed further explanation that the game was beginning to resemble an
				article in an academic journal; the too frequent appearance of footnote markers
				would make the game look too forbidding.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">I therefore decided to scrap the footnotes and employ a different approach:
				implementing a THINK ABOUT command. If the game mentioned something that might be
				obscure to the player, such as the Synoptic Problem or Q, or even Moses or the Empty
				Tomb, the player could simply type, say, THINK ABOUT Q, to tap into the player
				character’s specialist knowledge (and opinions). The advantage of this approach is
				that it never thrusts itself on players’ attention; there is seldom any need to
				think about anything in the game,<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e745">[30]</a> and players can use the THINK ABOUT
				command when and only when their curiosity is roused. This approach also opens up
				further educational potential for the game; those players can learn quite a lot
				about the biblical text and scholarly approaches to it if they are so minded, but
				none is compelled to do so, though hopefully the context of the game makes it an
				enjoyable way to learn.</div><div id="figure03" class="figure"><div class="ptext"><a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000010/resources/images/eve2007c.jpg" rel="external"><img src="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/1/2/000010/resources/images/eve2007c.jpg" alt="Screen shot demonstrating the THINK ABOUT command from All Hope Abandon"/></a></div><div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 3. </div>The THINK ABOUT command in action.

					standard IF abbreviation for EXAMINE; providing a suitable response to X ME is
					one way an author can quickly convey something about the Player Character to the
					Player. In this instance both THINK ABOUT and X ME serve to close the gap
					between what the Player Character knows and what the Player knows.</div></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Many of the other challenges and design decisions affecting "All
					Hope Abandon" were of a kind common to many works of IF, such a pacing
				and puzzle design. The key decision made in the design of "All
					Hope Abandon" was to link narrative progress with geographical progress;
				the narrative advances through the near-death experience as the player character
				advances through the map. This in turns means that most of all the puzzles are
					"gating" puzzles, obstacles that need to be overcome in order to
				advance to the next set of map locations. All this was part of the design from the
				beginning. A subsidiary aspect of this design included making the gating puzzles
				irreversible at crucial points, limiting the ability of the PC to backtrack and so
				driving the narrative forwards. Linked to this were puzzles that forced the PC to
				part with all of his inventory (the items carried) at various points, thus
				preventing an accumulation of an ever-growing stack of objects that were no longer
					useful.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e768">[31]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">Apart from a number of purely technical issues, the other main design challenge was
				the implementation of the NPCs. Here, the setting of the main part of the game in a
				mythological landscape greatly helped; since the setting was clearly not a
				real-world one, and many of the NPCs were so strange (they included a demon, a
				demoness, a talking crow and a talking serpent) that it would not be particularly
				jarring if some of their responses were a little odd; on the contrary, oddity is
				only to be expected. "All Hope Abandon" does make full
				use of the conversational tools provided by TADS 3, but its use of them is less
				taxing than it would be in a game set in more realistic world. Moreover, the two
				real-world segments right at the beginning and end of the game are so brief that the
				PC only has the opportunity to converse with one NPC (Felicity), and then only for
				such a short span of time that any unnaturalness in the conversation hardly has a
				chance to become apparent.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">"All Hope Abandon" breaks no new ground in the matter of
				room descriptions, the constraints of supplying adequate information in limited
				space remain, but it does add one related feature, the ability of the PC not simply
				to LOOK at the current location, but to LOOK in particular directions (such as LOOK
				NORTH or LOOK SOUTHEAST). The game then responds with a brief description of what
				can be seen in that direction from where the PC is currently located. This probably
				turned out to be little more than a gimmick, however, since it would have been too
				unwieldy to have supplied any new information to the player by this means. If new
				information had been conveyed to the player through such commands, then players
				would have been forced to look in every direction in every location to be sure of
				not missing anything, and this would rapidly have become intolerably tedious. It
				would also have gone against the convention that a normal room description should
				supply players with all the information they need (which may include calling
				attention to objects they need to examine more closely). The ability to LOOK in
				particular directions may have created a slightly deeper sense of immersion for some
				players, since the game could at least give a reasonably appropriate response to
				such commands, but it is not an experiment I have so far felt like repeating in
				subsequent works.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Interactive Fiction and Biblical Text</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">At first sight interactive fiction, which began life as a species of computer game,
				would seem to be a world apart from Biblical Studies (or any other humanities
				discipline). It may nevertheless be interesting to reflect on how a work such as
					"All Hope Abandon" may be suggestive for relating
				these seemingly disparate worlds.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">The first point to make is that "All Hope Abandon" makes
				no attempt to render the biblical narratives it employs in any straightforward,
				realistic manner. It alludes to a number of biblical stories, and full appreciation
				of the game probably requires quite a good grasp of the sweep of biblical narrative,
				but nowhere does "All Hope Abandon" make a serious
				attempt to retell a biblical story. This is partly a recognition of the real
				differences between the media of static text and IF; attempts to render existing
				stories as IF rarely come off well.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e799">[32]</a>Taking all or part of a
				static text like Mark’s Gospel and trying to turn it into IF almost certainly would
				not have worked (though a piece of IF loosely inspired by the biblical text could be
				a very different matter). For one thing there is an essential mismatch between the
				linearity of the narrative in a conventional static text, and the player’s apparent
				freedom in a work of IF. This freedom may only be apparent; a skilled IF author can
				effectively force players to a predetermined conclusion while creating the illusion
				of almost total freedom, but the route to that conclusion cannot be so tightly
				controlled as in static fiction (or, if it is, the resulting game will scarcely work
				as a piece of IF; players generally object when the game too obviously puts them on
				rails). There is no way that an IF author can successfully force a player to follow
				the precise sequence of events that appears in a static text, and a well-written
				piece of IF has to reckon with the possibility that a player may choose to do
				something different from the protagonist of a pre-existing story.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e832">[33]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">That said, there are a number of ways in which "All Hope
				Abandon" functions similarly to the biblical texts it plays off. The first is
				in the employment of intertextuality. For the most part "All
					Hope Abandon" uses the biblical text (and other texts) allusively,
				occasionally quoting them, sometimes representing aspects of them more or less
				closely. This is similar to the way in which many New Testament texts make use of
				the Old Testament. Thus, for example, the opening of Luke’s gospel is written in
				such a way as to resemble the opening of 1 Samuel, or the opening of Matthew’s
				gospel recalls the birth of Moses and a dreaming patriarch named Joseph. Thus, too,
				is the way that several of the more spectacular miracle stories operate; the Feeding
				of the Five Thousand (Mark 6.30-44 and parallels) resembles a similar feeding
				conducted by the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 4.42-44) and is probably meant to recall
				the feeding in the wilderness (Exodus 16) as well as the promise of a Davidic
				shepherd who would heal and feed his flock (Ezekiel 34). Likewise the Stilling of
				the Storm (Mark 4.35) recalls both the story of the storm at sea suffered by Jonah
				(Jonah 1) and the song of praise from those who go down to the sea in ships (Psalm
				107.23-32). Such examples could be multiplied almost endlessly; they are integral to
				the way much of the New Testament (and also quite a bit of the Old Testament)
					functions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e845">[34]</a> To be sure the
				New Testament is not only a static text but a sacred one; its employment of
				intertextuality is inevitably both different in nature and more serious in intent
				from that of any work of IF. Again, the intertextual allusiveness of "All Hope Abandon" is hardly characteristic of IF as a
				whole. There are nevertheless similarities in intent insofar as both the New
				Testament and "All Hope Abandon" seek to create new
				narratives that rely for much of their meaning on earlier sacred texts, and neither
				is simply giving a new rendering of an old story.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e870">[35]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">A less incidental link between IF and biblical text lies in their common relation to
				the riddle. Nick Montfort argues that the riddle is one of the main literary
				precursors to interactive fiction in that it is both textual (or at least verbal)
				and challenges the reader/hearer to find a solution <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#montfort2003a">#montfort2003a</a></span>. There is also a riddling quality to some biblical texts, not
				least the Gospel of Mark, which provides some of the main biblical allusions in
					"All Hope Abandon". Mark 4.1-34 to some extent
				presents Jesus’ parables as riddles;<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e891">[36]</a> to those
				outside, everything comes "in parables" so that "seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not
					understand" (Mark 4.10-12, alluding to Isa. 6.9-10). The parable of the
				sower is thus made a parable about the reception of parables, but just as seed is
				sown in the ground for the purpose of growth, so the concealment of teaching in the
				guise of parables is apparently intended for the purpose of revelation: "for nothing is hidden except in order to be made known, nor does
					it become hidden but that it might come into the open" (Mark
					4.22).<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e922">[37]</a> The Markan Jesus continually challenges the disciples to
				understand, and they continually fail (Mark 4.10-13, 41; 6.52; 7.17-18; 8.14-21).
				Mark’s readers are challenged to do better: "if anyone has ears
					to hear, let them hear" (Mark 4.23). The careful reader of Mark’s Gospel
				may easily come to the conclusion that this applies, not just to the parables in
				Mark, but to the entire narrative: there is clearly much more going on in this
				gospel than appears on the surface.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e934">[38]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">Hiding something in order that it may come to light is (both literally and
				figuratively) a common strategy in writing IF; it is the essence of puzzles that the
				player/reader is meant to solve them in order to advance the plot, and perhaps also
				the player’s understanding of the work as a whole.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e938">[39]</a> Used well, this
				is intended to deepen the player’s involvement in the narrative; to the extent
				players are forced to provide their own solutions to the puzzles the story provides
				they tend to find themselves taking ownership of the outcomes. The puzzling nature
				of the parables (and other material) in Mark’s Gospel seems directed at a similar
				(though deeper) end; in particular it seems to be part of Mark’s strategy to bring
				his target audience round to the authorial viewpoint (or, at least, the point of
				view of the implied author of the Gospel).<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e941">[40]</a> Gospel and IF games remain examples
				of different media, but there is here a convergence of reader responses, even though
				in the case of the Gospel the reader cannot direct the actions of the protagonist.
				Insofar as a work of IF is designed so that part of the challenge of the work is to
				understand what is going on, that convergence becomes greater (without ever
				approximating to identity).<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e947">[41]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">Although a modern reader cannot affect either the course of events or even the style
				of narration in a static text like a gospel, the situation may have been a little
				different when the gospels were first written. Like most texts in antiquity (when
				literacy was restricted to a small fraction of the population), they would have been
				written as scripts for oral performance, not books for private perusal, and some
				proportion of the material now incorporated in the gospels probably enjoyed oral
				circulation for some time before being committed to writing. Mark’s Gospel is
				particularly close to oral storytelling, both in its folksy narrative style (such as
				the frequent use of the historic present, parataxis, the word
				"immediately", and otherwise non-literary Greek), and in its overall
					structure.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e954">[42]</a> Although it is now in fixed textual form, it
				was very likely shaped in interaction with its first hearers.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e966">[43]</a> What we have now is a static text, and so a
				modern reading does not reproduce this experience of shaping the text (as opposed to
				its interpretation), but there is a possible analogy between the way many biblical
				texts came into being and the way the textual output of a work of interactive
				fiction comes into being, by the co-operation of performer/author and active
					listener/reader.<a class="noteRef" href="#d32920e981">[44]</a></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53">Finally, IF provides an interesting analogy in the age-old problem of divine
				sovereignty and human free will. One obvious place where this surfaces in the
				biblical text being used for comparison here is where the Markan Jesus declares that
				his betrayer is performing a preordained role in the divine plan, but must
				nevertheless bear full responsibility for his actions (Mark 14.21), but the problem
				is clearly much wider than that one instance. If the universe has been made by an
				omnipotent and omniscient creator, what space is left for human free will? One
				useful analogy is that between the author of a novel and the characters within the
				novel. Clearly the novelist has full control over the story world he or she creates
				and the actions of everyone with it, yet if the characters are not to appear mere
				puppets, they must have a certain authenticity and vitality of their own; from the
				inner-narrative perspective of the story world they act as free agents. It would not
				be appropriate, for example, for a criminal collared by Sherlock Holmes to plead,
					"It wasn’t my fault, it was that scoundrel Conan Doyle who
					made me do it; he’s writing this story after all." Such an excuse would
				involve a confusion of levels, since at the story-level the villain is free and
				responsible for his actions.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p54">But useful though that analogy is, it breaks down if pressed too far, for, after all,
				novelists do control all the thoughts and actions of all their characters, so that
				their characters enjoy no real independence. Interactive fiction provides a more
				satisfactory analogy, since here the protagonist is genuinely guided by an
				intelligence distinct from that of his or her creator, namely that of the player.
				The story-world is still the creation of the author, but the player is genuinely
				free to direct the actions of the PC. It is up to the author what difference that
				makes; a work of IF can be so structured that the outcome is the same regardless, or
				so that the PC’s choices make a real difference. Both design options are intriguing
				in this context, the one modelling freedom of action leading to a predetermined
				conclusion, and the other a created world in which the author allows choice to
				influence outcome. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55">It is true that the actions open to a player character in a work of interactive
				fiction are generally circumscribed, but this is often if not mostly true of real
				life as well; in practice we all operate under a number of constraints that limit
				our practical options to a finite and frequently quite small number. Reflecting on
				the relation of author, player and player character will not solve any age-old
				theological problems, but it may provide some new insights for thinking about human
				free will in relation to the powers of a creator.</div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusions</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p56">Interactive fiction is a distinct medium. In many important respects it is unlike
				static fiction, film, drama, opera, poetry or any such more conventional medium; in
				certain respects it perhaps most closely resembles the give-and-take of oral
				narrative performed in the presence of a participatory audience. Its distinctiveness
				means that it is unlikely to shed much light on, say, the kind of traditional
				historical-critical questions that still occupy much of contemporary biblical
				scholarship. But it may help to generate fresh insights in other areas, such as how
				readers and listeners interact with texts, and how the puzzling nature of a text
				like Mark’s gospel helps draw readers into the narrative and take ownership of their
				interpretations. That virtually all interactive fiction has an element of play does
				not of itself disqualify it from serious consideration; there can be a playfulness
				about static texts as well, including the way some biblical texts play with other

						secrets are revealed to the seer by a vision, a heavenly journey, or the
						words of an angel (or some combination of all three). All too often,
						however, the term is used as if it meant eschatological, and for want of a
						better term it is often used to describe a particular type of eschatology in
						which ordinary human history is expected to be interrupted by a catastrophic
						divine intervention in the near future (the reason being that such
						eschatology is frequently expressed through the medium of apocalyptic in the
						first sense).<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Byte Code:</span> The name often given to the intermediate product of compilation; a byte code

						a debugger and an interpreter on which the game may be tested.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Inform:</span> The most popular language/system for authoring Interactive Fiction, written
						and maintained by Graham Nelson. Two versions of Inform are currently in
						use. Inform 6 (the older version) resembles a conventional programming
						language. Inform 7 adopts a more "natural language" style of
						programming with the aim of making the process of writing Interactive
						Fiction more like writing prose and less like conventional programming.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Implicit Action:</span> An action automatically carried out by the parser in order to facilitate the
						command the player actually typed; for example if the player types GO
						THROUGH RED DOOR when the red door is locked but the player has the key, a
						well-behaved parser would carry out implicit UNLOCK RED DOOR and OPEN RED
						DOOR actions rather than forcing the player to type these commands
						explicitly.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Inventory:</span> The items currently carried by the Player Character.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Interpreter:</span> A piece of software that (typically) implements a Virtual Machine and so
						allows a game compiled to byte code to be run on the player’s computer; one
						generally needs an interpreter to run a work of Interactive Fiction in the
						same way that would need a copy of MS-Word to read a Word file, or a program
						such as Windows Media Player to watch a DVD on a computer. The advantage is
						that an interpreter needs to be written only once for each operating system
						(Windows, MAC-OS, Linux, etc.) and can then play all the games written for
						that interpreter.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Library:</span> A set of supporting routines supplied with an IF authoring system such as
						TADS or Inform that handles most of the tasks common to most works of
						Interactive Fiction; a library will typically implement a parser and at
						least a basic world model, and will generally be written in the same
						language as that supplied with the authoring system to allow ready
						customization by game authors. <br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Map:</span> The totality of rooms within a particular work of Interactive Fiction,
						together with the interconnections between them.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Menu:</span> A set of options presented to a computer user from which he or she is meant
						to select one.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Non Player Character (or NPC):</span> Any animate character (human, animal, alien or robotic) that appears in a
						work of Interactive Fiction apart from the Player Character; characters
						whose actions are not controlled by the Player Character. Usually, the term
						is restricted to characters who are actually implemented and can be
						interacted with rather than characters who are only mentioned or who never
						remain on stage long enough for the Player Character to interact with.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Object:</span> Something physical that the Player Character can interact with (or at least
						examine) in the course of the game, such as a table, chair, pen, or book
						(or, indeed, another character). Some objects may be quasi-physical (such as
						smoke or sunlight). In many IF authoring systems based on OOP
						(object-oriented programming) design, "object" may also refer
						to a programming object; in such systems a game object (in the first sense)
						will usually be represented by a programming object (the second sense), but
						programming objects may also be used for other purposes (if you don’t know
						anything about OOP, this second sense of "object" is probably
						irrelevant to you).<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Parser:</span> That part of the software in a work in the Interactive Fiction that
						interprets the player’s command and translates it into an action that the
						program can perform (or else complain if translation is impossible or
						ambiguous).<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Player:</span> The flesh-and-blood human being typing the commands at a keyboard and
						reading the game’s responses on screen.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Player Character (or PC):</span> The protagonist of a work of Interactive Fiction, whose actions are
						controlled (or at least guided) by the player, and through whose eyes and
						ears the fictional world is described to the player.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Room:</span> A (normally discrete) unit of space within the game’s map. The usual
						convention is that the Player Character can interact with anything that is
						in the same room as himself or herself (unless it is deliberately
						concealed), and so a room is effectively that volume of space that is
						immediately present to the Player Character. A room may be a room in the
						ordinary sense of a room within a building, but it may also be a section of
						space outdoors, such as a meadow, the top of a hill, or a section of street.
					<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Scope:</span> Roughly speaking, the set of objects with which the Player Character can
						currently interact, given the nature of the action he or she is meant to be
						carrying out. Normally this will be restricted to the objects the PC can see
						or touch, but this is not always the case. If the action is conversational,
						e.g. ASK ACTOR ABOUT TOPIC, then any object (or topic) is potentially in
						scope. If the author has implemented a GO TO ROOM command to take the Player
						Character to anywhere on the map, then any (known) room will be in
					scope.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Spoiler:</span> A piece of information (typically in a review) which reveals too much to
						someone who has yet to play the game, and so spoils the experience of
						playing it for the first time.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">TADS:</span> An acronym for Text Adventure Development System, one of the two major
						languages/systems in which amateur Interactive Fiction is currently written.
						TADS 2 is still in use, but the latest incarnation (in which "All Hope Abandon" was written) is TADS 3. TADS was
						written by and is maintained by Mike Roberts.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Virtual Machine (or VM):</span> technically, a computing device implemented in software rather than as a
						piece of hardware (hence "virtual"); a piece of software that
						can execute byte code written for it, usually implemented as an interpreter
						for Interactive Fiction.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">World Model:</span> That part of a work of an IF that defines the behaviour of the story-world
						in which the action takes place (such as movement around the map, the
						containment hierarchy, and some basic physics); typically, much of a game’s
						world model is supplied by the library of the authoring system used.<br/><br/></dd><dd class="item"><span class="label bold">Z-Machine:</span> The Virtual Machine for which the Infocom games were written, and to which
						games written in Inform compile.<br/><br/></dd></dl></div></div></div><div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d32920e141"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span>For other definitions of Interactive
