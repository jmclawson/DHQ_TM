				on Old English meter that he later re-wrote into a book (A New Theory of Old English
				Meter, Peter Lang, 1985). In the course of the re-writing, he created electronic
				versions of Beowulf and The Battle of Maldon and wrote programs in dBase to analyze
				their metrical patterns. Thus, although he did not realize it until later, he began
				doing humanities computing in 1982. His second book, Language and Style in The
				Inheritors (University Press of America, 1999), analyzes the style of William Golding's
				second novel, using what would now be called corpus stylistic methods. His recent work
				is in authorship attribution and statistical and corpus stylistics, but his research
				interests also include linguistic stylistics, animal language and cognition, and the
				history and structure of the English language. </div><div class="ptext" id="jerz_d"><strong>Dennis G. Jerz</strong> Dennis G. Jerz is Associate Professor of English — New Media

                also at Glasgow in 1999. In 2002 she completed her doctorate at the University of Oxford, which was a 
                joint project between the Department of Engineering Science and the Centre for the Study of Ancient 
                Documents, on using image processing and artificial intelligence to try and "read" the Roman documents

                    unit, providing impartial advice to the UK government on matters scientific. Now at University
                    College London, she is a lecturer in the School of Library, Archive, and Information Studies on
