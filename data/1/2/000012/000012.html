But the
				popularity of textual analysis has waned in recent decades, just at the time that
				widely available electronic texts were making traditional analytic tools easier to
				apply and encouraging the development of innovative computer-assisted tools. Without
				claiming any simple causal relationship, I argue that the marginalization of textual
				analysis and other text-centered approaches owes something to the dominance of
				Chomskyan linguistics and the popularity of high theory. Certainly both an
				introspective, sentence-oriented, formalist linguistic approach and literary
				theories deeply influenced by ideas about the sign's instability and the tendency of
				texts to disintegrate under critical pressure minimize the importance of the text.
				Using examples from Noam Chomsky, Jerome McGann, and Stanley Fish, I argue for a
				return to the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to see what
				corpora, text-analysis, statistical stylistics, and authorship attribution can
				reveal about meanings and style. The recent resurgence of interest in scholarly
				editions, corpora, text- analysis, stylistics, and authorship suggest that the
				electronic text may finally reach its full potential.</p></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Introduction</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1"> Unfortunately for the history of digital humanities, the advent of widely available
				electronic texts coincided with the Chomsky years in linguistics and the theory
				years in literary studies. Although these orthodoxies rest on very different
				theoretical underpinnings, they both tend to deny the legitimacy of text-analysis
				and stylistics. They de-emphasize the close study of texts and cast doubt on its
				significance and centrality. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2"> Chomsky’s mentalist approach, which has dominated American linguistics for more than
				forty years, locates its site of interest in the mind and treats texts and other
				stretches of naturally occurring language almost as irrelevant excrescences on the
				body of the innate language organ. It emphasizes the formal nature of grammar,
				downplays semantics, focuses on competence/deep structure rather than textual domain
				of performance/surface structure, ignores literature, and restricts itself to the
				scope of the sentence. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3"> Much high theory is deeply influenced by ideas about the instability of the sign and
				the tendency of texts to disintegrate under critical pressure, ideas most closely
				associated with the late Jacques Derrida. Theory has had almost nothing to say about
				Chomsky, focusing instead on Saussure, a linguist whose ideas are more congenial, at
				least in the sense that they discuss the process of signification at length. Jerome
				McGann, for example, champions the game-like, "fundamentally
					subjective character of . . . criticism"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2004">#mcgann2004</a></span> and asks "What if the
					question isn’t '<em class="emph">how</em> could he [the critic] take
						himself or his ideas seriously' but 'why
							<em class="emph">should</em> he take himself or his ideas
					seriously'?"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2004">#mcgann2004</a></span>. Stanley Fish
				emphasizes the reader’s role, attacking the idea that texts have meaning at
				all–arguing that the only links that exist between the text and its interpretation
				are those that are "fashioned in response to the demands of the
					reading experience"[<a class="ref" href="#fish1980">Fish 1980</a>, 64]. Critical approaches like these and a more
				general distrust of the sign/signified link within literary theory helped to produce
				a climate inhospitable to text-analysis and stylistics. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4"> It is not necessary to insist on any direct causal relationship between the hegemony
				of Chomskyan linguistics and high theory and the marginalization of textual analysis
				and other text-centered approaches, but, whatever their other merits, these two
				influential trends have certainly helped to keep the tremendous potential of
				electronic texts for literary study from being realized. Recently, however, there
				have been signs of a resurgence of interest in scholarly editions, corpora,
				text-analysis, stylistics, and authorship that suggest that the electronic text may
				finally reach its full potential. Because the point I want to make is such a basic
				one, I will present only a couple of very simple ways of returning to the text,
				merely mentioning some more sophisticated methods in my conclusion. The nature of
				the methodology is less important than the reestablishment of the text as the
				central focus of inquiry, as one of the most important objects of study. </div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Chomsky, Innateness, and the Irrelevant Text</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Let us begin with Chomsky, and one of the most characteristic and important
				principles of his theory: the innateness of linguistic ability. If it is not
				immediately apparent that a belief that human language is largely the result of a
				set of innate mechanisms necessarily devalues texts, an examination of one of the
				most central of Chomsky’s arguments for innateness quickly shows why this is so. In
				a move that harkens back to Plato’s argument for innate ideas, Chomsky argues that
				language learning would be impossible without a rich, specifically linguistic innate
				mental structure. The facts that a native speaker knows about the language, he
				argues, are too complex, too subtle, too regular, and too unpredictable to have been
				learned from the language to which the child has been exposed. Because the speaker
				manifestly knows them, there must be an innate language component that allows the
				speaker to "acquire" language (not "learn" it) with
				extreme rapidity, without explicit instruction, and on the basis of evidence that is
				inadequate and often corrupt. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6"> This is not the place to examine all of Chomsky’s arguments (for a thorough and
				careful critique of the innateness hypothesis and various arguments for it, see [<a class="ref" href="#sampson2005">Sampson 2005</a>]). For my purposes, however, I will
				focus on the last argument, that the evidence to which the child is exposed is
				inadequate and corrupt. Although it is increasingly clear that the language children
				are exposed to is less corrupt than Chomsky supposed (why he supposed it rather than
				examining it is another aspect of the devaluation of text), but the more important
				question for the history and future of the study of texts is whether his argument
				from lack of evidence is persuasive, whether it is true that speakers know things
				for which they have no relevant experience. Another way of framing his argument is
				to say that the "texts" on the basis of which a child comes to know a
				language are faulty, incomplete, and insufficient. Given that, why study them? </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7"> One classic and often-repeated kind of evidence for innateness comes from question
				formation in English. How can a child determine the correct form of the question
				version of "The man is tall"[<a class="ref" href="#chomsky1975">Chomsky 1975</a>, 31]? The simplest rule that the child might
				entertain is that the first verb moves to the front, which correctly gives
					"Is the man tall?" But in "The man who is tall is in the
					room," this simple rule gives the wrong question form: "*Is the
					man who tall is in the room?" (Here, as is usual in linguistic
				discussions, the asterisk marks an ungrammatical form.) The correct rule requires
				that the child analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence and apply a more
				accurate but more complicated rule: move the first verb after the first noun phrase
				of the main sentence to the front [<a class="ref" href="#chomsky1975">Chomsky 1975</a>, 31–2]. The
				crucial argument for innateness is that, as Chomsky puts it, "A
					person may go through a considerable part of his life without ever facing
					relevant evidence, but he will have no hesitation in using the
					structure-dependent rule, even if all of his experience is consistent
				with" the simpler rule [<a class="ref" href="#chomsky1975">Chomsky 1975</a>, 32]. Because all
				speakers of English arrive at a rule for which they often have no relevant evidence,
				knowledge of grammatical principles must be innate.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8"> In his wonderful book, <cite class="title italic">The "Language
						Instinct" Debate</cite>, Geoffrey Sampson uses textual evidence from
				corpora very effectively to counter this classic argument for innateness. He
				presents "The subjects who have acted as controls will be
				paid" as his example of a sentence for which the simple rule gives the
				incorrect result. He notes that Blake’s "Did he who made the
					lamb make thee?" is an example of counter-evidence that most school
				children will be exposed to, and then finds that 12% of all yes/no questions in a 40
				million word <cite class="title italic">Wall Street Journal</cite> corpus from 1987-89
				are of a form that would contradict the potentially wrong rule [<a class="ref" href="#sampson2005">Sampson 2005</a>, 46–47]. There is thus no reason to think that
				speakers lack the relevant evidence against the simple form of the question rule,
				and one of Chomsky’s central arguments for innateness loses much of its force. What
				Sampson’s example makes clear is that Chomsky’s reliance on intuition and his
				rejection of textual evidence leads him to base a central premise of his innateness
				hypothesis on the non-existence of sentence types that actually occur fairly
				frequently. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9"> In fairness, when Chomsky first presented this argument, there were no huge corpora
				for him to examine, and some of the subtle grammatical facts upon which his
				arguments depend are so infrequent that it would have been quixotic to have searched
				for examples. Yet the grounds for Chomsky’s rejection of corpora and of the evidence
				of texts are more theoretical than practical, so that the subsequent availability of
				huge corpora has had almost no impact on the Chomskyan tradition. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10"> A second claim for an innate grammatical principle that can be contested using
				electronic corpora involves the following sentences: <blockquote class="quotedlist"><div class="ptext"><ul class="list simple"><li class="item">a. John was (too) clever to catch.</li><li class="item">b. John was (too) clever to be caught.</li><li class="item">c. John was (too) easy to catch.</li><li class="item">d. John was (too) easy to be caught.</li></ul></div><p class="ptr">[<a class="ref" href="#chomsky2000">Chomsky 2000</a>, 168]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11"> Chomsky argues that an innate Faculty of Language (FL) that is "common to the species, assuming states that vary in limited ways with
					experience"[<a class="ref" href="#chomsky2000">Chomsky 2000</a>, 168] is required to explain how a person can
				produce sentences like (1a-d), and understand some surprising features of their
				meaning. Chomsky’s important insights about such sentences involve agency and the
				question of what the adjective modifies. As he suggests, with "too,"
				they don’t catch John in (1a-b) and "clever" modifies John. It is
				unclear whether or not they catch John in (1c-d) ("John was easy for them to
					catch, so they didn’t bother."), but the catching is
				"easy," not John. We may all agree that these are interesting
				observations, especially because the sentences seem so similar in structure, but not
				everyone agrees that (1d) is deviant, as his proposed innate principle requires.
				Phrases like "easy to be caught" are so rare that <cite class="title italic">Wall Street Journal</cite> corpus and even the 100 million word
				British National Corpus (BNC) are too small to provide sufficient examples for
				analysis, though I did find the following tantalizing parallel to the deviant form
				in 1d in Mark Davies new 100+ million word <cite class="title italic">Time Magazine corpus
					(2007)</cite>: "The Clinton are just not easy to be caught
					by a pumpkin head" [<a class="ref" href="#trillin1998">Trillin 1998</a>]. Chomsky’s argument is not tied to any particular verb,
				however, so that we can also consider the exactly parallel sentence with a more
				common verb: "John was easy to find/easy to be found." Chomsky’s
				argument obviously entails the deviance of the passive version of this sentence, but
				counterexamples to his views are too easy to be found in real sentences for them to
				be taken seriously. My preceding sentence violates his claim, as do thousands of
				sentences that a Google search for "easy to be found" (7/16/06)
				returns.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12"> Although Google is neither a good nor a representative corpus, my interest here is
				in naturally occurring texts. Thus it seems reasonable to allow Google’s enormous
				body of texts to act as a corpus, so long as its limitations are acknowledged.
				Chomsky’s argument, remember, is that "John is easy to be
				caught" violates an innate principle of grammar, so that the presence of
				large numbers of examples of this construction, even in a relatively poor corpus,
				should count as evidence against his theory.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13"> Chomsky might reject many of the Google hits as modern, casual examples, ones in
				which "performance" might not match "competence." The

				that these were discovered using Google is clearly unimportant, and the relatively
				long list below makes its own point (each was accessed at the listed URL on July 16,
				2006): <blockquote><p>For nothing is more easy to be found, then be barking

				from such textual evidence is that there is no necessary connection between our
				knowledge of language (competence), and our ability to use it (performance) [<a class="ref" href="#chomsky1986">Chomsky 1986</a>, 8–13] for an extended discussion). And this
				argument shows how central the devaluation of text is to the theory. Yet it seems
				unreasonable to argue that Swift had the innate "knowledge" that
					"easy to be found" violates a grammatical principle but lacked
				the "ability" to apply this knowledge in a formal, edited, poetic
				context, or that his editors, with the same innate knowledge, somehow failed to
				notice that the sentence is ungrammatical. Errors do find their way into print, but
				the existence of tens of thousands of examples (including those with other verbs
				than "found") from the seventeenth century to the present both
				undermines Chomsky’s evidence for this innate principle of grammar and supports the
				usefulness and validity of corpus-based text-analytic methods of language study. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15"> Needless to say, Chomsky’s theory does not rest entirely on this principle, and it
				could be revised so as to eliminate this "knowledge" from the claimed
				competence of the English speaker. Yet exceptions to principles of grammar that
				Chomsky claims are universal and innate and uses as central pieces of evidence for
				the innateness hypothesis are so frequent and so easily found (or easy to be found)
				as to suggest that his theory will eventually have to come to terms with them if it
				is to survive. Natural language corpora are becoming so large that they can now
				realistically be used to test the linguist’s intuitions about what sentences are
				ungrammatical. And it will not do to suggest that those who use the
				"deviant" passives have a different grammar, if the deviance is
				derived from a principle that is claimed to be innate. Corpora can also be used to
				search for grammatical structures that have not yet been integrated into linguistic
				theory, and so can enrich our understanding of human language. They can also be used
				to investigate the relationship between competence and performance, or, perhaps more

					that forces the reader to confront profound and important questions about the
					stability of texts and the nature of interpretation. McGann uses an experiment
					involving the scanning and optical character recognition of a Victorian
					periodical to show that texts are unstable under one kind of machine-assisted
						"reading." He argues that instability is an inherent feature
					of all texts, that texts "are not containers of meaning or
						data but sets of rules (algorithms) for generating themselves: for
						discovering, organizing, and utilizing meanings and data"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2004">#mcgann2004</a></span>. This is a valuable insight–one that helps
					the reader to see more clearly the kinds of problems that textual editors have
					long had to deal with (see Peter Shillingsburg’s <cite class="title italic">From
						Gutenberg to Google,</cite> 2007 for an illuminating recent discussion). I
					have argued elsewhere that McGann overestimates the instability of the text [<a class="ref" href="#hoover2006">Hoover 2006</a>]. Here I want to focus on the way it devalues textual

					themselves is that each generation is potentially unique, a product of the
					algorithms and the interpreting mind. For McGann, this suggests a recuperation
					of an old but recently neglected kind of performative criticism that he suggests
					can open the text to interesting new readings. The performative critic practices
					what McGann calls "deformance" by manipulating the order of the
					textual elements and even changing them. For example, after printing the lines
					of Wallace Steven’s "The Snow Man" in reverse order,
					McGann argues that deformance accentuates the intelligibility of the text and
						"clarifies the secondary status of the interpretation"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2004">#mcgann2004</a></span>. He then prints only the nouns of the
					poem, leaving them in roughly their original positions and arguing that doing so
					shows it to be a noun-heavy and noun-balanced poem. (The word
					"poem" here is intended as uncontroversial shorthand for
						"poetic text." Poems are typically more highly structured
					than prose texts, and provide additional opportunities for deformance, so that
					it is often important to distinguish them.)</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Having practiced deformance (under the name of text alteration) for twenty-five
					years, I can hardly object to it in principle. It does seem to me, however, that
					the practice of textual deformance is most valuable when it is turned back upon
					the original text as a tool of interpretation (see <a href="#hoover2004a">Hoover (2004a)</a>, <a href="#hoover2006">Hoover (2006)</a>).
					Printing only the nouns is an effective way of focusing attention on them, and
					any deformance initially requires close attention to the text. When its aims are
					a better understanding of the text, it allows the critic to uncover previously
					hidden relationships among the parts of the text and to examine the nature of
					its self-generating algorithm. But when the focus is on performing with the
					poem, on uncovering "uncommon critical possibilities"<span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2004">#mcgann2004</a></span>, the critic’s attention is turned away from
					the text. This turn is crucial, I would argue, precisely because the text
					otherwise exercises a powerful coercive effect on interpretation and limits the
					critical possibilities. Textual algorithms normally constrain or direct the
					reader’s activities. Although the algorithms for generating <cite class="title italic">Jane Eyre</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Wuthering Heights</cite> were
					written by sisters and published the same year, they are radically different and

						good enough for Miss Emily and such. We had long thought of them as a
						tableau; Miss Emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father
						a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a
						horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door. So when she
						got to be thirty and was still single, we were not pleased exactly, but
						vindicated; even with insanity in the family she wouldn't have turned down
						all of her chances if they had really materialized.  [<a class="ref" href="#faulkner1978">Faulkner 1978</a>, 434]</p></blockquote><div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29"> Holland suggests that if a reader believed that the "tableau"

					support it, but because no current interpretive strategy exists for producing
					such a reading: <blockquote><p>While there are always mechanisms for ruling out

					signally missing from "A Rose for Emily" is any
					actual textual reference to Inuit culture, and Holland’s point is far more
					specific than the version Fish rejects: being "informed" by Inuit
					readings is not much like "describing an Eskimo," so that Fish’s
					imagined letter is simply irrelevant to Holland’s point. (Note that the claim
					that the meaning is not in the text effectively insulates Fish against this kind
					of criticism.) If critics really reacted as Fish suggests they would, so much
					the worse for criticism, but it seems far more likely that, <em class="emph">because of the
						nature of Faulkner’s texts,</em> either such a letter would be rejected as
					a forgery or critics would wonder why being a changeling had so little influence
					on his writing. Readings can and do change over time, sometimes radically, and
					critics like Fish are partly responsible for the current tolerance for a greater
					distance between the text and its interpretation than might have existed in the
					past. Still, interpretations are not as independent of the text as Fish
					suggests, and he ignores the huge overlap between even the most violently
					contrasting interpretations, the sources of which, given the variety among the
					interpretive communities that he suggests are responsible for the
					interpretations, surely include the text. For that matter, it is difficult to
					imagine the formation of the kind of interpretive community Fish posits in the

					who has just taken a class from Fish asks this question on the first day of
					class of another professor who takes it to be a question about whether there is
					a required textbook. The student corrects the professor: "No, no . . . I mean in this class do we believe in poems and things, or is
						it just us?"[<a class="ref" href="#fish1980">Fish 1980</a>, 305]. Fish’s insistence on the importance of
					context for interpretation is valuable, and it provides a welcome change from
					the single-sentence focus of Chomskyan linguistics. Of central importance here
					is his claim that we interpret such a sentence by virtue of belonging to an
					interpretive community in which it makes sense and not by virtue of the meanings
					of its words or their syntactic relationships. In what follows I will focus on
					this claim, but also on the question itself and what he has to say about it. </div><div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">Fish discusses the two meanings of the question above and suggests a third

					context, not out of the text. It is a tribute to Fish’s skill at argumentation
					that the extreme form of his position has been taken seriously. It is apparent,
					for example, that the words of the sentence and their syntactic arrangement
					deeply influence all three of these meanings (how did the professor know it was
					a question?), and that the crux of the matter is the ambiguity of "text,""in," and "class" that my paraphrases highlight.
					Given the importance he places on interpretive communities, it is surprising
					that Fish refuses to acknowledge one of the largest and most important of the
					interpretive communities relevant to this example: speakers of English. In that
					community, there are such things as meanings of words (of course not Platonic
					forms or Aristotelian categories), meanings that are, as he rightly points out,
					more or less profoundly affected by the context of use, broadly understood to
					include things like the other interpretive communities to which the professor
					and student belong.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Given Fish’s valuable emphasis on the contextual nature of meaning, it also seems
					surprising that the text should be denied a part in the creation of that
					meaning. Fish is surely right that the relationships, contexts, and interpretive
					communities that surround or constitute his classroom tableau, as well as the
					personal histories of the student and professor are crucial to the professor’s
					understanding of the student’s question, and to her ability to produce it. But
					the question itself is also an important element in the entire exchange. "What are your office hours?" spoken in the identical
					context (first day of class, the same student and professor, etc.) obviously
					means something very different and calls for a radically different set of
					possible answers. However problematically, the sources of difference must
					include the language of the question. The practice of holding office hours,
					their nature, their typical format and scheduling and their institutional
					status–all of their meaning in the academic interpretive community–is partially
					dependent on the words "office" and "hours" and
					how those words are used, both in English generally, and within that community.
					To put it another way, one of the chief ways one becomes a member of an
					interpretive community is by learning to understand and respond to its texts
					appropriately.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37"> But let us return to the text. Fish suggests that, while none of the meanings is
					the only literal one, "Is there a required textbook for this
						course?" is "more normal" than "Will this course assume the meaningfulness of texts?" (he does not
					further discuss the third meaning). He argues that the first meaning has a
					broader context of understanding (the participants need only know roughly what
					is normal in the context of the first day of class), and the second a narrower,
					more specialized one (the participants need to know something about Fish’s
					literary theory). The fact that the student and the professor could only have
					come to the required knowledge through reading and listening to Fish’s ideas,
					however, makes his cavalier neglect of the words of the text seem little more
					than a debater’s trick.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">But if we use corpora to investigate the crucial phrase "text
						in this class" and some variants of it, we gain access to evidence
					about how that huge interpretive community called "speakers of
					English" actually uses the phrase. Unfortunately, the phrase is not
					common enough for the BNC to be of much use, though the fact that the only
					instance of "text in this class" in the BNC is a reference to the
					title of Fish’s book is significant, as will become clear shortly. Turning again
					to Google (search for "text in this class", 7/20/06), we find

					difficulties of interpretation for the reader: Lok does not know what bows and
					arrows are and cannot (yet) imagine one person attacking another, but Golding
					must make us see that the man has just shot a poisoned arrow at him. Halliday’s
					analysis argues that the reader’s difficulty is at least partly explained by the
					peculiar Neanderthal notion of agency, in which a stick might change length by
					itself, and by the novel’s limited vocabulary, in which there are no arrows or
					arrowheads, no bows or the drawing of them, and no poison, but rather "a
						twig,""a lump of bone,""a stick," and "bitter berries." Fish rejects
					Halliday’s claim that the unusual features of the text force the reader to
					reinterpret "The stick began to grow shorter at both
					ends" as the drawing of the bow:</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42"><blockquote><p>The link between the language and any sense we have of
							Neanderthal man is fashioned in response to the demands of the reading
							experience; it does not exist prior to that experience, and in the
							experience of another work it will not be fashioned, even if the work
							were to display the same formal features. In any number of contexts, the
							sentence "the stick grew shorter at both
							ends" would present no difficulty for a reader; it would require
							no effort of reinterpretation, and therefore it would not take on the
							meaning which that effort creates in <cite class="title italic">The

					mean that a bow has been drawn without the context in which it occurs, but my
					experience has been that the passage alone is sufficient context for many
					readers. (It seems pointless to quibble that he has misquoted the sentence; if
					the text is not the source of the meaning, that should be irrelevant in any
					case.) But in any context, the sentence shapes any normal reader's
					interpretation in very definite ways–simply by virtue of its grammatical and
					lexical characteristics and the grammar and lexicon of English that the reader
					has learned. The reader must find some way of assimilating the fact that the
					stick changes length by itself, and most readers will reinterpret this sentence
					by adding the agency that Lok does not understand.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">I have suggested that this sentence might seem relatively normal in a description
					of a magic trick or a campfire [<a class="ref" href="#hoover1999">Hoover 1999</a>, 23–4], but an
					examination of its occurrences in large corpora suggests further ramifications
					that I had not considered: "grow shorter" is essentially an
					oxymoron, and so might be expected to be uncommon. The metaphor of
						"becoming larger is growing" is a cognitively grounded one in
					which increasing in size is modeled on growth, our preeminent natural example of
					increase in size, and one that we have all intimately experienced. Inanimate
					objects do not generally increase in size without an external cause, and the
					best examples for the metaphor are glaciers, rivers, lakes, lava flows,
					avalanches, and objects like snowballs rolling down hills, balloons, or
					crystals. The best examples of decrease in size are compression, shrinking,
					erosion, melting, and deflation.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45"> Without "stick" the phrase "grow shorter" seems
					quite ordinary, in spite of being an oxymoron, and there are ten examples of a
					form of "grow" followed by "shorter" in the BNC:
						<blockquote><div class="ptext"><ul class="list simple"><li class="item">The architecture of triticale was altered so that it would grow
								shorter</li><li class="item">new selection pressure, and will be pushed towards growing shorter

					ordinary phrase are quotations from <cite class="title italic">The Inheritors</cite>.
					Only the first two of the ten use "grow" in the biological sense.
					In all the others "grow" can be replaced by
					"become" and only the sentence from <cite class="title italic">The
						Inheritors</cite> describes an object changing size in real time. In
					comparison, there are thirty-nine examples of a form of "grow"
					followed by "longer" in the BNC. Perhaps surprisingly, only nine
					of these refer to biological growth, and none of the thirty-nine describes an
					object changing size in real time. (Surprises are the norm when reading a
					concordance <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#sinclair2003">#sinclair2003</a></span>, [<a class="ref" href="#sinclair2004">Sinclair 2004</a>]).
					Phrases with forms of "become" instead of "grow"
					are even less frequent.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">A Google search for forms of "grow shorter" (7/20/06)
					returns tens of thousands of hits, but an examination of several hundred of them
					suggests that things that grow shorter tend to fall into a few main categories:
						<ul class="list"><li class="item">days and other periods of time, cycles, hospital stays</li><li class="item">articles of clothing, hair, body parts and plant parts (become shorter
							over time, or from one generation to the next)</li><li class="item">temper, patience</li><li class="item">meetings, lectures, speeches, phone calls, letters, lists, sentences,

						shorter" is "become shorter", that the process of
					shortening is typically one that takes place in stages (especially for physical
					objects), and that many of the things that become shorter are abstract. By far
					the most frequent item that grows shorter is "days," as the BNC
					list above also suggests ("grow shorter" returns more than
					100,000 hits; "days grow shorter" returns more than 55,000). When
					physical objects actually diminish in size, they are usually being consumed by
					fire. Finally, there is a smattering of examples that are relevant to <cite class="title italic">The Inheritors</cite>: those that belong to the realms of
					fantasy and magic, including transformation stories and role-playing games.
					Textual evidence shows that even the relatively ordinary "grow
					shorter" is significantly constrained, especially when the subject of
					the verb is a physical object and the change is taking place in the present, in
					real time. And this evidence supports Halliday’s claims about the oddness of
					Golding’s sentence and suggests a cause for the reader’s reaction.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">Returning to the full sentence makes this point more forcefully. A Google search
					for "the stick began to grow shorter at both ends"
					(7/20/06) returns only eight hits, all quotations from <cite class="title italic">The
						Inheritors</cite>, and dropping "at both ends" returns four
					additional slightly variant quotations. A more recent search (7/2/07) returns
					twenty-one hits, but all are still from the novel, as are the eight additional
					hits returned by dropping "at both ends." Many six-word sequences
					from novels will return only quotations as hits, however, so that it seems
					reasonable to expand the search by focusing on the crux of the sentence:
						"stick grew shorter." This returns only four additional hits:
					one is a paraphrase of Golding, two are duplicates in which a walking stick is
					worn away on a long journey, and in the other the stick shortens as it burns.
					There is one example of "[observed my searing] stick grow
						shorter", which refers to smoking a cigarette. There are no hits for
						"stick grows shorter", but an earlier search
					(12/22/05) returned one example referring to cigarette smoking. A search for
						"stick grew longer" returns only one hit, in a
					history of hockey, where it describes the use of successively longer sticks, but
					there were three other interesting hits in my earlier search, one a dream
					sequence in which a sharp stick threateningly lengthens toward the dreamer’s
					face and two pieces of fantasy fiction, one of which involves the explicit use
					of magical dust. Fish’s claim that Golding’s sentence would present no
					difficulty in "any number of contexts" begins to seem
					quite doubtful, and a text-analytic corpus approach both provides unexpected
					insights and gives us access to evidence about how sentences are used–evidence
					that seems far more reliable than that of unaided intuition.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">A much larger corpus would be useful in examining how and what Golding’s sentence
					means, but the examples I have found suggest that sticks grow shorter only in
					extremely limited contexts outside Golding’s novel, either in relatively prosaic
					contexts where they are burnt up or wear away, or in the fantastic contexts of
					dreams and magic. Golding’s sentence has precisely the effect Halliday claims
					for it: it pushes us into a (necessarily fantastic) Neanderthal world in which
					inanimate objects are not really inanimate, in which Lok’s feet are
						"clever" and can see, in which logs might crawl off on
					business of their own. In which passages like this make sense: <blockquote><p class="ptext">"The stone is a good stone," said Lok.
									"It has not gone away. It has stayed by the
									fire until Mal came back to it."</p><p class="quote">He stood up and peered over the earth and stones down the slope. The
								river had not gone away either or the mountains. The overhang had
								waited for them. Quite suddenly he was swept up by a tide of
								happiness and exultation. Everything had waited for them: Oa had
								waited for them. Even now she was pushing up the spikes of the
								bulbs, fattening the grubs, reeking the smells out of the earth,
								bulging the fat buds out of every crevice and bough.  [<a class="ref" href="#golding1955">Golding 1955</a>, 31–2]</p></blockquote></div><div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">Part of the power of "the stick began to grow shorter at both
						ends" is in the shape of Lok’s incomprehension. For Lok, the whole
					world is alive, so that a stick that changes length is perfectly comprehensible.
					Readers of the novel, which is full of passages like the one above, come to see
					this animistic view as no mere personification, but rather as an integral part
					of Lok’s world view, his mind style. They also comprehend what he does not,
					until it is too late–the murderous agency of his enemy, the bender of the bow.</div><div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">It is true that an appropriate context is required to interpret Golding’s
					Neanderthal world, as Fish so forcefully argues, but to focus only on the
					interpretive community as a source of possible interpretations of texts is not
					only to ignore the creative acts of the writers who created those texts, but
					also to deny ourselves access to the most crucial element of the context in
					which a reader interprets <cite class="title italic">The Inheritors:</cite> the novel
					itself. Any theoretical position that ignores, devalues, or rejects the text
					merely encourages sloppy thinking and foolish interpretations. </div></div></div><div class="div div0"><h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1><div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53">It is time for a return to the text, specifically the electronic, computable text, to

				hidden "semantic prosodies" and multi-word meaning
				structures that have eluded thousands of years of textual study [<a class="ref" href="#louw1993">Louw 1993</a>], and can clarify and confirm the meaningfulness of a text’s
