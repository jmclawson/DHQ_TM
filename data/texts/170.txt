IntroductionWhen listening to music people often think that sounds
                        like so-and-so's song or that song sounds
                        like so-and-so. What is it that triggers people
                    to make these judgments? Maybe it is the chord progression,
                    the type of instrument accompaniment, the rhythm, or perhaps
                    elements that cannot be specifically explained, such as the
                    impression that the music makes; all of these can have an
                    effect. However, of the factors that greatly influence these
                    judgments, the lyrics have the most significant bearing.
                    There are many factors associated with lyrics that influence
                    these judgments, such as unique expressions and the visual
                    effect of the lyrics on a lyric sheet as well as the
                    repetition of certain words. Of course, it is said that a
                    song can be attributed to an artist because certain lyrics
                    are applied to a certain chord progression, but if these are
                    then separated, there will be cases when it is impossible to
                    speculate whose song it is. However, in many cases, which
                    artist a song belongs to can be deduced just by reading the
                    lyrics. If the individual characteristics of an artist
                    really are clearly expressed in the lyrics and people do not
                    notice, then what are these characteristics? Moreover, what
                    specific factors trigger the intuition people feel which
                    makes them say this sounds like so-and-so? If we turn our eyes to the situation in modern Japan, there
                    are in fact not only communities on social networks relating
                    to singers and
                        music, but also communities
                    relating to the lyrics of certain singers. On one of Japan's
                    foremost music information sites, Barks Global Music
                            Explorerhttp://www.barks.jp, a feature article
                    called Ranking of artists with
                        heart-stopping lyrics is regularly published
                    .
                    Whether it is online or offline communities, lyrics are a
                    subject often touched on by the young generation. The way
                    people communicate is changing owing to the development of
                    communication equipment such as cell phones and PCs, and the
                    resulting spread of systems such as Twitter. People
                    who are complete strangers and who cannot even see each
                    other's faces can now communicate just because they have
                    something in common. Many people have a shared knowledge of
                    popular song lyrics and are also able to relate to them. It
                    is thought that when people are receptive to popular music,
                    one of the most important factors is the lyrics. Popular
                    lyrics and lyrics people relate with are a useful medium for
                    analyzing not only the communication between singers and
                    fans, but also between fans and other fans or, in other
                    words, the way in which ordinary people communicate with
                    each other daily. Also in a sociological theory, the lyrics
                    of popular songs are said to be a good representation of the
                    tastes and linguistic sensitivity of the people of that
                    generation. According to Mita ,
                    popular songs are not just things we listen to, but also
                    things we hum along and sing along to. In particular,
                    karaoke has been established as a popular pastime in Japan,
                    especially for the younger generation, and popular songs
                    reflect people's feelings, fashions, and their manner of
                    communication. Many popular arts, such as novels, movies,
                    and television programs, are used as factors for analyzing
                    culture and society. However, people connect with these
                    passively, whereas, even though they are passively imparted,
                    popular songs are a medium in which people can actively
                    participate by humming and singing . An individual's writing, such as notes, diaries, and
                    journals, are also used to analyze a person's lifestyle, but
                    these are documents that record the specific independent
                    opinions of an individual person and unlike popular songs,
                    which are on trend; in other words, they are songs that are
                    accepted by the majority of the public and contain lyrics
                    that are also accepted . In this regard, songs
                    represent the tastes and linguistic sensitivity of the
                    people of that generation, and are a more appropriate medium
                    for observing the macroscopic shifts and changes in Japanese
                    culture. Singer-songwriters are singers that compose their own lyrics
                    and music and they form one of the major genres in the hit
                    charts in modern Japan . They
                    have a long tradition in Japanese music, but they began to
                    flourish in the 1970s in Japan as a small genre, and since
                    then, female singer-songwriters have increased the genre's
                    importance . The message of their
                    lyrics is very powerful and their impact is significant,
                    thus singer-songwriters are an extremely interesting subject
                    matter for lyrical analysis, in particular lyrical analysis
                    using computational stylistics methods as conducted in this
                    study, because they are important for investigating the way
                    in which people in modern Japan communicate. There have been some studies that tried to investigate the
                    characteristics of language and communication styles from
                    popular songs, although their methods mainly involved
                    qualitative analyses of source documents or interviews with
                    artists and eminent personalities in these fields. Some
                    studies stressed the importance of investigating the lyrical
                    characteristics of popular songs, but in fact they focused
                    only on specific songs or singers for their analyses . Turning our eyes to the field of
                    computational stylistics, the current scope of research has
                    expanded considerably with an increasing variety of
                    available data and the development of natural language
                    processing techniques. In addition to the conventional
                    applications such as authorship attribution and genre-based
                    text classification, computational stylistics methods are
                    used for various new applications such as authorship
                    profiling, computational sociolinguistics, and plagiarism
                    detection 
                    . These methods must be very
                    useful for analyzing the textual characteristics of
                    lyrics. Considering this backdrop, this study uses computational
                    stylistics methods to analyze popular Japanese songs
                    composed by Japanese female singer-songwriters over the past
                    30 years. From the viewpoint of computational stylistics,
                    the purpose of this study has the following four
                    characteristics: (a) the number of tokens is considerably
                    small, (b) several factors (e.g., authors and eras) affect
                    the textual characteristics, (c) the content as well as the
                    style can affect the textual characteristics, and (d) we
                    wanted to obtain linguistically and sociologically
                    meaningful findings instead of just enhancing the
                    classification method. We deliberately selected the features
                    and methods appropriate for our purposes to obtain an
                    important case study for computational stylistics. We also
                    attempted to provide useful knowledge for understanding
                    current Japanese language and communication styles.Data and MethodsDataWe selected 116 songs composed by 10 singer-songwriters
                        (those who wrote more than 90% of their songs) that
                        appeared on the Oricon annual top 100 single hit chart
                            ;  more than five times in the
                        past 30 years. We collected the text data from Uta Net
                            (http://www.uta-net.com) and Uta Map (http://www.utamap.com), which are databases
                        of Japanese popular songs, and excluded the titles,
                        spaces, and explanatory phrases. We applied
                        morphological analysis by MeCab (http://mecab.sourceforge.net), a Japanese
                        morphological analysis system. We calculated the
                        relative frequencies for each text file, and constructed
                        a text-feature matrix. Previous authorship attribution studies showed that
                        function words or character based n-grams provide a more
                        robust classification performance ; however, we selected
                        bag-of-words as features due to reason (d), as mentioned
                        in the Introduction, which states that our purpose is to
                        obtain linguistically and sociologically meaningful
                        findings instead of enhancing the classification
                        performance. We used content words as well as function
                        words because of the aforementioned reason (a) the
                        number of tokens is considerably small and (c) the
                        content as well as the style can affect the textual
                        characteristics. It is possible to analyze more specific
                        aspects with analyses that use only function words and
                        content words. We intend to study these subjects in the
                        future.Statistical MethodsWhen we considered that several factors affect the
                        textual characteristics, we first applied the kernel PCA
                        to the matrix in order to examine the factors affecting
                        the lyrical characteristics of the songs. We selected
                        the Gaussian kernel and parameter sigma = 0.1, which
                        gave the best possible results for interpretation after
                        attempting several kernels and parameters. Previous
                        studies used a principal component analysis, a
                        correspondent analysis, or a factor analysis for these
                        tasks; however, the kernel PCA sets up kernels and
                        parameters more flexibly; thus, it is more suitable for
                        use in preliminary and exploratory research, such as
                        this paper. Second, we applied random forests machine learning
                        methods  in order to perform
                        the classification experiments for the 10 selected
                        singers. This method has proved the best performance for
                        authorship attribution in Japanese , and has also been the best
                        method for similar types of feature extraction tasks
                            . We analyzed the results of the classification to find
                        the singers who had special individual lyrical
                        characteristics (high classification performance) and
                        those who had common lyrical characteristics (low
                        classification performance). In addition, we extracted
                        the important features for classification in order to
                        find the special distinguishing lyrical characteristic
                        of every singer-songwriter. Random forests are an improved method of bagging , which is an ensemble
                        learning method. The purpose of ensemble learning is to
                        improve the classification performance of previous
                        statistical methods, such as decision trees, by
                        repeatedly performing the experiments and calculating
                        the mean or majority votes of the results. However, the
                        results will always be identical when the same data is
                        used to perform these experiments; thus, ensemble
                        learning methods including bagging usually use bootstrap
                        samplings from the original data to repeat the
                        experiments. The major advantage of using random forests
                        instead of bagging is the extraction of a random subset
                        from each bootstrapping sample, which enlarges the
                        variances in bootstrapping samples ; . We first sampled from i cases at random from the
                        original text-feature matrix M_[i,j] with replacements
                        to make a bootstrap sample, and we extracted random
                        subsets of [root j] variables from a bootstrap sample to
                        make a sample for constructing an unpruned decision
                        tree. To split the nodes, we used the Gini index
                        formalized as follows:where p_[tau k] represents the proportion of
                            data points in region R[tau]assigned to class k (k =
                            1, ... , K), which vanishes for p_[tau k] = 0 and
                            p_[tau k] = 1 and has a maximum at p_[tau k] = 0:5
                            [Bishop 2006]. These sampling, extraction, and
                            tree-constructing processes were repeated 1000
                            times, and we constructed a new classifier by a
                            majority vote of the set of trees. Two-thirds of the
                            extracted bootstrap samples were used for
                            constructing the model and the other one-third were
                            left out for testing the modelThis is called
                                Out-of-bag tests.
                   An important characteristic of random forests is that it
                        returns variable importance (VIacu
                  ) for the
                        classification experiments. To calculate variable
                        importance, we first put down the out-of-bag cases and
                        counted the number of votes cast for the correct class,
                        and then randomly permuted the values of variable [root
                        j] in the out-of-bag cases, and put these cases down the
                        tree. We subtracted the number of votes for the correct
                        class in the variable-[root j]-permuted out-of-bag data
                        from the number of votes for the correct class in the
                        original untouched out-of-bag data. We calculated the
                        average of this number over all trees in the forest, and
                        that number was the raw importance score for variable
                        [root j]. Finally, we divided the raw score by the
                        standard error of the variable in the calculation over
                        all trees, and that number was VIacu
                   for variable m
                            ; . VIacu
                   represents the importance of
                        variables for classification. This method is
                        advantageous because this study aims to compare the
                        contributions of the morphemes rather than achieving the
                        best performance. This method calculates important
                        variables directly contributing to the classification in
                        the experiment; thus, it is most suitable for this
                        study.Results and DiscussionBasic Data for Selected Singer-songwritersTable 1 shows the year the
                        selected female singer-songwriters made their debuts and
                        their ages at those times. The debut years and debut
                        ages were taken from the official websites of the
                        respective singer-songwriters. First, we found that the
                        debut age ranged from the late teens to early 20s. The
                        average debut age is 20.7. In general, because of the
                        high profile of Hikaru Utada, the impression is that the
                        debut age has fallen in recent years. However, these
                        results indicate that the debut age has thus far barely
                        changed. Next, if we look at the data by decade, there were three
                        singer-songwriters in the 1970s who regularly had hit
                        songs, in the 1990s there were five, and in the 2000s
                        there were two. In contrast, there were no
                        singer-songwriters in the 1980s that matched our
                        selection criteria. In the 1980s, instead of
                        singer-songwriters, female singers referred to as idols
                        frequented the popular chart. Around that time, popular
                        music programs were established on TV and were beginning
                        to take off and, rather than singer-songwriters who pour
                        forth their beliefs and feelings in their lyrics, it was
                        the attractive, generally well-received idols who
                        attracted sponsors that were popular . In contrast to this, in the
                        1990s, there was a gathering momentum towards female
                        social equality and independence, and the number of
                        women and young people buying music was increasing .As a result, the genre of the
                        female singer-songwriter seemed to be energized once
                        more in place of the spectacle of the idol. It can be
                        said that the results of this study clearly reflect the
                        changes in Japanese society and the changes in the music
                        industry.Female singer-songwritersDebut yearDebut ageaiko199823Komi Hirose199226Yumi Matsutoya197318Miyuki Nakajima197523Maki Oguro199222Ai Otsuka200321Ringo Shina199819Mariya Takeuchi197823Hikaru Utada199815YUI200517Basic Characteristics for Selected SongsTable 2 represents the

                        for the 10 singer-songwriters. The number of texts
                        ranges from 7 to 20, and the mean number of tokens
                        ranges from 155 to 273. The table shows that Utada and
                        Nakajima have a large number of songs, whereas Hirose,
                        Takeuchi and Shina have a small number of songs in our
                        dataset. It also shows that Hirose generally prefers
                        short songs, and YUI and Utada have large variances in
                        the length of their songs. As explained later, this may
                        be because they preferred English words.Results of basic characteristics. The number of

                        PCA)Figure 1 and 2 show three dimensional
                        scatter plots of the first three principal components by
                        kernel PCA. The results show that the songs by the same
                        singer are grouped, for example, aiko's songs are
                        grouped in the upper side, Utada and YUI's songs toward
                        the right, and Nakajima's songs toward the left. In the
                        kernel PCA, compared with the factors concerning the
                        singer, the factors concerning the era are not clearly
                        observed, which was also true when the release years
                        were used as labels. The grouping results and a qualitative analysis of the
                        songs shows that the first principal component includes
                        the factor of loanwords because Utada and YUI's songs
                        have many of such words, and the third principal
                        component includes the factor of pronouns, because
                        aiko's songs have many special first person pronouns.
                        However, these three axes are composed of many words,
                        thus their labeling becomes difficult.Three-dimensional scatter plots of the first three
                        principal components by kernel PCA. The labels represent
                        the names of the singer-songwriters. Three-dimensional scatter plots of the first three
                        principal components by kernel PCA (2). The labels
                        represent the years of release. Results on Random ForestsTable 3 represents the
                        confusion matrix constructed by random forests. The
                        results show that the songs by aiko, Nakajima, and Utada
                        have high classification performance, whereas those by
                        Hirose, Oguro, and Matsutoya have low classification
                        performance. These results also show that the songs by
                        the first three singer-songwriters have special
                        individual characteristics among Japanese female
                        singer-songwriters, while those by the last three
                        singer-songwriters have common characteristics. It is
                        certain that the number of texts and the number of
                        tokens can affect classification performance. However,
                        aiko, for example, has no special lyrical
                        characteristics within these textual characteristics;
                        thus, these results also show the special lyrical
                        characteristics of the singers.Results of the classification experiment by using

                            all aiko's songs were recognized from her texts,
                            whereas none of Hirose's songs were identified from

                        forests. The results show that the top 20 important
                        features include many pronouns, final particles, and
                        auxiliary verbs. The results also show that these words
                        are particularly important for discriminating the songs
                        by 10 Japanese female singer-songwriters.Top 20 important features for the classification

                        lyrics of the three singer-songwriters who made their
                        debut in the 1970s and the lyrics of the seven
                        singer-songwriters who have made their debut since the
                        1990s. According to the kernel PCA, differences based on
                        singer are more significant than those based on the
                        simple era labels. Therefore, era classification was
                        conducted according to the debut year of the singer
                        rather than by decade. For example, in the 1990s there
                        are of course compositions written by Miyuki Nakajima,
                        but these are treated as Miyuki Nakajima's compositions.
                            Table 5 shows the
                        confusion matrix and Table
                            6 shows the top 20 important features in the
                        experiment. We found that a number of trends can be
                        identified in Table 5
                        because there are many songs from the new era, but a
                        moderate classification was obtained from the confusion
                        matrix results. Many function words, such as wa
                        and wo and many personal pronouns, such as
                            watashi (I), are included in Table 6 as well as in Table 4. As we shall see
                        later, the other words of high importance in the
                        singer-songwriter classification, those that contribute
                        significantly to the classification, also achieve high

                        feature, although watashi (I) is usually used in
                        spoken Japanese. Pronouns have strong discriminant power
                        in authorship attribution ,
                            ; thus, we inferred
                        that this lyrical characteristic of her songs led to the
                        lowest error rates in Table
                            2. In addition, words representing parts of
                        the body, such as me

                            (cheeks), and kuchibiru (lips) appeared at 7, 8
                        and 14 ranks, and we inferred that they show her special
                        lyrical characteristic. This is apparent in her use of
                        the following lyrics for example, 夏髪が頬を切る(natsukami ga hoho wo

                            sparkle]).Kohmi HiroseMany content words are ranked in the top ranked words.
                        Contrary to function words, content words were known to
                        serve as noises for better classification between
                        authors [; therefore, we
                        inferred that this lyrical characteristic of her songs
                        led to high error rates shown in Table 2. It can be inferred that many of
                        Hirose's song lyrics concern the theme of love because
                        the words love and ai (love) appear as one of the
                        important words. It is thought that the word love
                        ranked top because there are many phrases that contain
                            love applied to sections where the lyrics are
                        repeated, such as Fall in Love ロマンスの神様 この人でしょうか(Fall in Love
                                romansu no kamisama
                                konohito de shou ka?; fall in love, is
                            this person the God of romance? (ロマンスの神様 [Romance no kamisama; God of

                            forever, eternal love) (Promise). In contrast to the other artists,
                        Kohmi Hirose was the only artist to have the word love
                        in romanized writing in the top ranked words.
                        Furthermore, Kohmi Hirose conjures a powerful image of
                            winter in Japan, but not a single word
                        relating to winter featured in the top ranking words, an
                        unexpected result.Yumi MatsutoyaThe particle wo
                        that represents the object is ranked in the top ranked
                        words. Examples of lyrics that use wo include,
                                初めて言葉を交わした日のその瞳を忘れないで(Hajimete kotoba wo kawashita hi no
                                sono hitomi wo wasure nai de; don't
                            forget the way your eyes were when we spoke for the
                            first time) (守ってあげたい(Mamotte agetai; I want
                            to protect you)) and 夢をくれし君の眼差しが肩を抱く
                                (yumewo kureshi kimi no
                                manazashi ga kata wo daku; the

                            comes]). In addition it can be inferred that
                        many of Yumi Matsutoya's lyrics concern love because the
                        word ai (love)
                        appears in the top rankings. Picking out several lyrics
                        as they appear reveals lyrical themes concerning love.
                        For example, 愛をくれし君のなつかしき声がする(ai wo kureshi kimi no natsukashiki
                                koe ga suru; I hear the longed-for
                            voice of the one who loves me) (春よ、来い[Haruyo,
                                koi; spring comes]) and
                                私を愛したことを後悔はしていないかしら(watashi wo aishita koto wo koukai
                                ha shite inai kashira; I wonder if you
                            regret loving me) (輪舞曲 (Rondo)).Miyuki NakajimaHiragana appeared at all except 10, 15 and 16 ranks, and
                        many of Hiragana words were function words, though other
                        singer-songwriters included more content words. We
                        inferred that she had a special lyrical characteristic
                        on the basis of the function words rather than the
                        content words. Function words have strong discriminant
                        power in authorship attribution , ; thus, we inferred that
                        this lyrical characteristic of her songs led to low
                        error rates shown in Table
                            2.Maki OhguroCompared to the other artists, there are few
                        characteristic words and also the classification
                        performance is poor. We conclude that either Maki Ohguro
                        is an artist with few characteristic words or she is an
                        artist with an extensive vocabulary who does not use
                        similar expressions. However, it should be noted that
                        the word kako
                            (past) is included only in Oguro's important
                        words. Words that represent time, such as kako (past),
                                mirai
                            (future) and genzai (present), are not
                        commonly heard from the other artists. Specifically,
                        phrases such as, 泣きながらあなたを諦めようとした過去も(nakinagara anata wo akirame you to
                                shita kakomo; the past when I cried
                            and tried to give you up (熱くなれ[Atsukunare; heat
                            up]) and 過去を責めてもあなたは帰らない(kako wo semetemo anata wa nera
                                nai; even if I blame the past, you do
                            not return) (チョット[Chotto; a
                            moment]), appear in her lyrics.Ai OtsukaMathematical numbers such as 1 and 2 appeared in the 1
                        and 4 ranks, while we can use kanji to indicate the same
                        meaning in Japanese. In addition, katakana in Japanese
                                (koto
                            (thing)) appeared at 7 rank and chatter
                        expressions such as Naa and nante appeared at 14 and 15
                        ranks. We inferred that these expressions make her songs
                        moderate and accessible, and can represent her special
                        lyrical characteristics. Examples of her lyrics include
                                恋してれば全てが2

                        in kanji appeared in
                        Aiko's ranking, but the same word in katakana appears in Otsuka's
                        ranking is also noteworthy. Using hiragana and katakana instead of Chinese numerals and
                        kanji softens the appearance of her lyrics. It does not
                        appear in the top important words, but the use of
                                toki
                            (when) in katakana instead of kanji in 好きなトキ出かけて好きなトキ甘えて(sukina toki dekakete sukina toki

                        is an example of this.Sheena RingoKanji appeared at 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, 17 ranks. Even
                        function words such as sono (its) and made (till) were
                        used in kanji, although
                        these words are usually written in hiragana in modern Japanese.
                        We inferred that, contrary to Otsuka, these expressions
                        make her songs solid and aggressive, and can represent
                        her special lyrical characteristic. The lyrics
                                グラスよりも其の御口に注いで戴きたいのだもの (gurasu yorimo sono okuchi ni
                                sosoide itadakitai no da mono; pour

                        addition, Ai Otsuka and Sheena Ringo use 居 (i; presence) as
                        representing the same meaning, but Shina often ventures
                        to use the kanji. For example, Otsuka writes,
                                いつだってそこにいてあげるんだ(itsu datte soko ni ite
                                agerunda; I'll always be there for

                        uses kanji are

                        ranks; therefore, we inferred that this lyrical
                        characteristic of her songs led to high error rates
                        shown in Table 2 as well as
                        Kohmi Hirose. Among the 10 singer-songwriters, Takeuchi
                        and Nakajima belonged to the 1970 and 1990 eras; their
                        lyrical characteristics were considerably different. In

                        that these words represent her special lyrical
                        characteristic, as well as people's communication styles
                        during that era. It can also be inferred that the
                        subject of many of her songs is love. Specific examples
                        include, 私だって命がけの恋に憧れることはある (watashi datte inochigake no koini
                                akogareru kotowa aru; I yearn for a
                            desperate love) (純愛ラプソディ[Junai
                            Rhapshody]), 手放した恋を今あなたも悔やんでるなら
                                (tebanashita koi wo ima
                                anatamo kuyanderu nara; if you also
                            regret throwing our love away) and 電話ぐらいくれてもいいのに (denwa gurai kuretemo
                                iinoni; just a phone call would
                            do) (シングル・アゲイン[single again]) and
                                にぎわう街の音がかすかに聞こえる(nigiwau machi no oto ga kasukani
                                kikoeru; I hear the faint sound of the
                            bustling city) (カムフラージュ[camouflage]).Hikaru UtadaThe second person pronoun Kimi (you) was the most important
                        distinguishing characteristic of Utada's songs, while
                        first person pronouns were more important in the other
                        nine singers. In the case of other artists, words that
                        represent the first person, such as atashi (I) and
                                watashi
                            (I) appear in the top rankings more often than
                        words that represent the second person, such as
                                kimi
                            (you) and anata (you), and it is only in
                        Utada's lyrics that second person pronouns out rank
                        first person pronouns. Specific examples of her lyrics
                        with kimi (you)
                        include, ありがとう、と君に言われるとなんだかせつない(arigatou, to kimi ni iwareru to
                                nandaka setsunai; when you tell me
                            thank you, it is somehow bittersweet) (Flavor of Life), いいじゃないかキャンバスは君のもの(iija nai ka kyanbasu wa kimi no
                                mono; that'll do, right? The canvas is
                            yours) (Colors), 君という光が私をみつける(kimi to iu hikari ga watashi wo
                                mitsukeru; a light called
                                you has found me)
                            (光[hikari; light] ),
                                もっと君に近づきたいよ(motto kimini chikazuki taiyo; I want
                            to get closer to you) and そっと君に手を伸ばすよ (sotto kimi ni te wo
                                nobasuyo; reaching out for you)
                            (SAKURA ドロップス
                            [sakura drops]) and 近づきたいよ君の理想に(chikazuki taiyo kimi no
                                risouni; I want to get closer to your
                            ideal) (Can You Keep a
                            Secret). In addition, many English words
                        such as I and baby appeared at 2, 3, 6, 7,
                        16 ranks, and we inferred that they represent her
                        special lyrical characteristics. It is inferred that she
                        uses a lot of imported words because she was born in New
                        York in America.YUIChatter expressions such as nante, desyo, tte, ja, as well as question marks,
                        appeared at 1, 2, 4, 7, 18 ranks. YUI moved to Tokyo
                        from Fukuoka at the age of 17 and is the youngest artist
                        in this analysis. It is inferred that her lyrics contain
                        Japanese expression of the new generation. Although YUI
                        is commonly known to prefer English words in her lyrics
                            ,For example, all
                            the titles of her songs are in English or written in
                            alphabets . this
                        characteristic of her lyrics did not clearly appear in
                            Table 2, because she
                        used various types of English words, and the number of
                        tokens of these words was rather small; thus, it cannot
                        be used well for her classification. In addition, the
                        word yoru
                            (night) appeared in YUI's important words, but
                        not those of any of the other artists. The appearance of
                        words that represent periods of time within a day, such
                        as asa (morning)
                        and hiru
                            (afternoon) and gozen (morning) and gogo (afternoon),
                        clearly demonstrates a world view in terms of time in
                        the lyrics. Specifically, in lyrics such as 星の夜願い込めて CHE.R.RY
                                (hoshi no yoru negai
                                komete che.r.ry; I make a wish in the
                            starry night, cherry) (Che.r.ry), なみだいろ声が聞こえない夜は (Namida iro koe ga kikoe nai yoru
                                wa; the color of tears on nights when
                            I can't hear your voice) ( Namidairo (the color of
                            tears)) and わすれちゃいそうな夜の真ん中(wasure chai souna yoru no mannaka; in
                            the middle of the night I begin to forget that)
                            (Again), it is possible to understand
                        the specific time of day and imagine the situation as
                        you listen and become more emotionally involved with the
                        lyrics. Furthermore, it was not part of the lyrical
                        analysis this time, but all of the names of YUI's songs
                        are written using a foreign language. YUI was born in
                        Fukuoka Prefecture and does not have the same unusual
                        background as Hikaru Utada, and therefore it could be
                        said that this is an idiosyncrasy of YUI's. YUI often
                        romanizes expressions that were not originally in
                        English, such as, CHE.R.RY
                        and Namidairo, and it is possible
                        that she has deliberately used an English title to
                        address any preconceptions that might arise from using a
                        Japanese title. These points require further study.Further DiscussionIn the section above, we analyzed the characteristics of
                    individual singer-songwriters. The common point that emerged
                    from this analysis is that love is invariably an important
                    subject for women regardless of the era. Many of the
                    listeners of songs written and sung by women such as Yumi
                    Matsutoya and Mariya Takeuchi in earlier decades and aiko
                    and Ai Otsuka in recent decades are young women, and love is
                    a common theme and an important feature of communication for
                    this age group. However, the style used to talk about love differs by era
                    and singer. For example, singers like Mariya Takeuchi and
                    Yumi Matsutoya use many words related less to linguistic
                    expression and more to lyrical content, imagery, and
                    feelings, expressing their individuality through such
                    content and imagery. In contrast, modern singers assert a
                    stronger linguistic and stylistic individuality: aiko with
                    her concrete representations of the body, Utada with
                    imported words, YUI with colloquialisms, Otsuka with
                    numerals, hiragana,
                        katakana, and so on,
                    and Shiina with formal
                    words and words of Chinese origin. This is a main feature of
                    the lyrics of Japanese female singer-songwriters from the
                    1990s onwards, following the idol period of the 1980s. Naturally, with this change there is also a corresponding
                    change in the listeners. Since 2000, communication on the
                    internet and by cell phone has increased and people's
                    conditions for communication and the style of language
                    people use when communicating continue to change
                    significantly. The arrival of the internet is producing a
                    new Japanese language that is neither spoken nor written
                    language , and the shape of the
                    Japanese language and, in particular, the way in which young
                    people communicate, is changing. As a new style emerges from
                    the past and traditional styles of writing narratives
                    continue to change, people are also choosing different
                    styles of and using different expressions for talking about
                    the same emotions. We conclude that this change in the
                    conditions for communication among such people corresponds
                    to the change in the lyrics of singer-songwriters. According to the findings of our research, the most
                    significant change in the lyrics of current
                    singer-songwriters can be conceptualized as the
                        visual effects of the lyrics. This partially
                    corresponds with the general change in Japanese characters
                    and communication styles among Japanese youngsters. However,
                    this concept includes aspects that are specific to the
                    stylistic characters of their lyrics. As we mention above, a
                    special characteristic of current singer-songwriters is
                    their varied characters. For example, a singer prefers
                            koto (thing)
                    in katakana, while another
                    prefers it in kanji.
                    Simultaneously, another singer favors sono (that) in hiragana, whereas another
                    prefers it in kanji. These
                    examples correspond with general changes in Japanese during
                    the 1990s and 2000s as well as the utilization of the
                    Internet, mobile phones, and e-mail as popular communication
                    tools. More specifically, among the young females, the
                    emotions or feelings that the
                        characters transmit have become
                    particularly important. This has led to the overall
                    popularity of emojis and emoticons. However, the styles of
                    their lyrics still include an independent character that
                    differs from the general changes in Japanese. With regard to emojis and emoticons, these general changes
                    in Japanese are written ones. However, written lyrics also
                    have an important role: they must be sung. Thus, we assume
                    that in the dynamic era of Japanese and its communication
                    styles, singer-songwriters must be sensitive in their
                    overall approach to writing lyrics, in which the meanings of
                    the words and their characters must effectively transmit
                    personal feelings or emotions. As mentioned in the
                    introduction, karaoke is a popular activity among young
                    people, in which singing the displayed
                    lyrics is equally important as being
                        heard. Current female singer-songwriters
                    select personal lyrical writing styles that correspond to
                    the latest communication styles. They must naturally
                    consider that their lyrics will be
                    sung. However, we must assume that they
                    are sensitive to the fact that their lyrics will also be
                        seen. Compared to this
                    aforementioned approach, the use of loan words is not a
                    unique characteristic that reflects the current
                    communication styles of youngsters. Our results indicate
                    that some singers, such as Utada and YUI, prefer using
                    English words in their lyrics. This was also seen in the
                    lyrics of singer-songwriters during the 1980s, including
                    Nakajima, Takeuchi, and Matsutoya. In this case, English
                    words could provide an alienation effect when heard, but
                    visually, they are still written in the standard manner.
                    Therefore, we can conclude that this is a secondary point of
                    discussion regarding the lyrics of current female
                    singer-songwriters YUI’s CHE.R.RY is an exception that uses the
                            visual effects of the lyrics even in
                        English..ConclusionIn summary, this study analyzed popular Japanese songs
                    composed by Japanese female singer-songwriters over the past
                    30 years, by using methods of computational stylistics. Our
                    texts contained various characteristics as mentioned in the
                    Introduction; thus our study using kernel PCA and random
                    forests provided an important case study for computational
                    stylistics. We also provided empirical knowledge for
                    understanding the Japanese language, and communication
                    styles. The results of this study showed that although love is a
                    common theme in the lyrics of female singer-songwriters, the
                    manner of expressing love varies significantly depending on
                    the era and the individual singer. The subtle topic of love
                    certainly differs for every singer-songwriter as well as
                    every song. However, we found many content-independent
                    characteristics, such as the selection of kanji and kana, in singer-songwriters after the 2000s.
                    These kinds of individuality are what make ordinary people
                    make comments like This sounds like such and such a
                        singer, and we were able to clarify these
                    differences by applying machine learning. The results of
                    this study suggest that the variety of styles is an
                    important characteristic of current singer-songwriters.
                    Thus, we can conclude that they emphasize linguistic and
                    stylistic factors, including word play. In this study, we
                    took the theoretical premise that lyrics are important for
                    understanding modern society and submitted it to empirical
                    analysis. According to , popular
                    songs are first sung, and The action of
                            Singing is primary and open to
                        a wider range of people than is the action of
                            Writing, thus it is closer to
                        the ordinary. However, in contemporary Japanese
                    society, in which karaoke is popular and communication
                    styles have changed, the popular songs are
                        seen as well as
                        sung. This visualization
                        of the lyrics is a typical characteristic of
                    current singer-songwriters. Therefore, this study adds this
                    point to Mita’s theory for identifying the application of
                    popular songs in current Japanese popular culture and
                    society. The shifts in modern Japanese culture can be investigated
                    further by analyzing each respective genre, lyrics in
                    conjunction with the other non-lyric musical elements of
                    popular music. It is no doubt possible to enhance the
                    results of this study by applying content analysis to the
                    lyrics and by using a larger data set. We intend to work on
                    these points in the future.
